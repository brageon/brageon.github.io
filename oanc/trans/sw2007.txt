 i don't guess we got our first uh credit card oh back in the seventies early seventies uh when i first got married was a Visa card uh issued out of a Liberty Bank in Oklahoma City because my uh-huh uh-huh sister worked at the uh uh the Visa Bank Americard center there so we were still in college and had she not worked there i'm not sure that i would have qualified uh-huh they've come in handy over the years yeah uh and they have become or also a a real bother sometimes oh tell me about it especially you know if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation it's just easier to put everything on a card uh-huh uh-huh and uh i find if you're not careful you wind up uh a month or so staring those bills in the face and you go i don't remember doing all that stuff and it adds up yeah they add up quick so sometimes uh especially traveling with TI you know everything goes on American Express uh-huh uh-huh and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping yeah but uh as far as personal life goes i guess i really try to use them as little as possible uh i kind of like having them for uh gasoline purchases yeah we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies you know yeah but but other than that uh i i guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome of just putting everything on there day after day after day and then then you really get socked to it if you don't watch it uh-huh yeah how how do you look at credit credit cards we just uh quit using them and they got us in trouble we took a loan and paid them all off that's we keep them uh we keep uh one gas card and uh and uh Visa just you know in case there's an emergency or something but other than that we don't use them anymore right well that's kind of the way we were coming it's it's uh i guess for that very reason that that uh uh-huh if you're not real conscious of what you're doing uh-huh it's just too much by the time you get well if you got a bunch of cards you get a bunch of bills every month and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid um-hum i know isn't that funny yeah and i give them maybe not maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid because they're know if you don't then they're adding on what eighteen nineteen twenty percent sometimes it's twenty two percent interest yeah yeah yeah and then some of them add late fees on it and say they don't get paid and yeah i guess that's one of the motivations behind the the uh um-hum huh the uh American Express card with TI there's no with the American Express card from TI there's no um huh uh uh late fee there's no uh interest rate you either you either pay the thing off or they come get it oh really and it's turned into personnel and they come get you so they've got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then oh yeah then some of the others do yeah but that's the one that your cost center manager sees every month uh-huh so you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that even though you can use it however you want to can you use that one for personal use oh yeah oh you can you can use it like any other card uh-huh and uh oh i see huh but it you know you kind of you know that somebody every month and who knows how many people are looking at those uh um-hum bills that come in and those statements you're not the only one um-hum yeah so you uh you want to make sure that uh is that okay is that okay okay that those people see what it is that you are buying and most of the time it is yeah but most of the others i've sent back i mean all you get is card offers i've got three card offers now uh from gas companies and uh Visa Gold and uh-huh uh some other bank uh Citibank i think is always sending the Visa stuff out and i usually just throw them away because i you know oh i do too i don't even open them much i throw them out i don't want another one i don't want to have to mess with it you know you carry around a wallet full of credit cards and uh uh-huh one of these days it's going to all be full a girlfriend of mine found uh uh it was a Visa or MasterCard she found the ad for one in like a Good Housekeeping Housekeeping magazine for eleven percent oh that's not bad so i said shoot i need one of those yeah no if they don't say no annual membership on them i'll throw them away um uh-huh years ago well that i had my Visa card through this bank in Oklahoma City for uh-huh oh probably fifteen years and then they star ted charging uh annual membership fees um-hum and i said adios i'm you know i'm not paying you why do they do that it's just another way to make money as far as i can tell i mean they've been i mean i mean they get enough you know on the interest well sure and they i guess they figure they've got enough people out there with cards they're going to get cards at uh twenty bucks a pop uh-huh uh-huh there's going to be that much more uh-huh uh so then a couple years ago i found uh a bank here in Plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was you can get a Visa card through them and no annual membership uh-huh so i went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account in his name and got my Visa card so as long as they have no annual membership fee i it would be okay but i can't see paying someone to use their card be charged that eighteen percent interests uh-huh huh no i can't either yeah so yeah i think you're right the best philosophy is have them if you need them but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere yeah yeah really gets a lot of people in in trouble yeah yeah it sure does maybe they're counting on that i don't know well i guess that's it thanks for talking okay nice talking to you bye-bye bye  so do you do any of your own repairs or maintenance work well i do a little bit i just do mainly you know change the oil and uh i'll do an occasional tune-up things like that change set of disc brakes but most of the stuff i have done i just don't have time to fool with it or you know it's just out of my technical expertise yeah do you have like an American or foreign car one of each okay a foreign and uh and i have a a truck because i know like i've got a a Honda and and it's just beyond even my my dad's and my husband's comprehension a lot of that stuff they grew up with Americans little simpler arrangements on under the hood so so they'll change the oil for me and yeah um that's about it these days yeah i don't work on anything foreign yeah it's it's well you've got to have a different set of tools for it and everything else too so you have to have metric don't you yeah metric well even even some American cars have that now but uh yeah uh they're still a little bit over all simpler you know to work on but uh yeah i feel like if if i can afford to have it done i'm going to have it done well it's it's a lot easier than getting under there and finding out something major has happened that you didn't know about and Advanced Auto closed fifteen minutes ago and yeah getting into that kind of hassle well have you had anything done to yours lately or yeah i had um well i was having problems with the cruise control um-hum so i had to take it down and have them look at that and they said it was something with the um the way the choke was adjusted yeah automatic choke yeah how much did that cost you to have that fixed well i had the um like the sixty thousand mile tune-up done at the same time so the whole thing was like two hundred dollars yeah not cheap like it used to be no it i mean the first time i found out how much it was going to be i about fell over yeah i've had uh we have a Volvo and uh i had some steering problems but and it ended up being the entire rack and pinion steering assembly holy cow and by the time i got everything done it was twelve hundred bucks wow so something something that small and that minor uh well it's not really minor but something that small can cost that much money was it is it a fairly new car i mean was it well it's five years old well that's still but but still it doesn't have that many miles it's got uh just over sixty five thousand miles on it and rack and pinion steerings uh i don't think i've ever heard of one going out i know i haven't the the little bit i know about cars i've never heard of anybody having that happen to them the uh the guy that i talked to that replaced it he said i just he said we've never really had to replace one we've had to go in and do some adjustments but never replace one but the actual gear teeth on this one had had broken man so i think it was a defect defect and i tried to get the Volvo Corporation to cover it but they just refused to do it did they so i just rather than get tied up in in a bunch of you know garbage i just went ahead and and got it done and and to heck with it yeah but uh and then the the truck i have i have uh i've had just virtually excellent luck with it and other than taking in for just regular warranty work and things like that it's it's been a real good truck well i've the only two cars i've had i had a Honda Civic and it was let's see uh i'm trying to think how old it was i got it in eighty one and got rid of it in eighty eight so it was seven years old and had almost a hundred thousand miles on it they're good cars yeah and i i mean i never had any problem with it and i've got an Accord now and other than you know minor tune-ups like with the the choke and stuff i've never had any problem with it so i've been really lucky i had a i had a Honda Accord uh it was uh trying to think what year it was uh i think it was an eighty eight or eighty seven eighty seven mine's an eighty eight and uh it's the the was the LXI with the the fuel injection is that what you have yeah no i've i've got the LX i think it still has fuel injection there's i think the DX is the one that does not okay but uh they are probably one of the nicest running cars i've ever driven they run good and they're and they're peppy yeah and this one's you said yours was just now about sixty five thousand and mine's an eighty eight and it's it just turned over seventy thousand yeah i i will i don't i don't think i'd ever buy another Volvo i bought it mainly uh for my wife and daughter for safety more than anything and i thought well it'd be an investment we'll be able to keep it for ten or twelve years so yeah sure and uh i i don't think i'd buy another one only because the maintenance costs are very very high yeah and that's just a little bit out of my range it's enough just to buy it without uh having the other problems but uh once it i will definitely go back go to uh now go back to Honda or Mazda or something like that next time we've been looking recently just you know mainly window shopping but um we've been thinking more American just because we want a bigger car this time um-hum and we've been looking at um Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis and we're leaning a little bit towards the uh Grand Marquis as far as just looks but my parents have a um Continental and they've had nothing but nightmares with that car oh really it's been it's been one thing after another going wrong that the local dealer either says there's nothing wrong it's your imagination or says well it's supposed to be that way just get used to it it's been an absolute nightmare for them hum so it kind of makes me dread going back to an American manufacturer that's been i think until they get the reliability up i don't you know other than trucks i've had always had good luck with American trucks but with cars i i've not had much luck with uh American cars especially General Motors yeah but uh you know i look at reliability and and you know like stuff like tires and and belts and stuff like that uh actually you can buy the parts cheaper for foreign cars if you buy them and put them in yourself sure yeah but if you have to have it done of course it ends up costing you the installation fee but i have had if i had to say dollar for dollar spending on foreign and as opposed to to American i spent far less on the foreign cars um-hum i believe that long term a lot a lot more and then then you add the the fuel savings on top of it yeah so my money's on foreign cars until American until the American cars can can meet the standards i wish there were bigger foreign cars really it seems like they kind of well that that's interesting that you say that because if you'll start looking now at some of the Hondas and some of the Mazdas and and a lot of the car companies now are beginning to scale up you know like the the Lexus really yeah see those cars if if you'll go look at them they're as big as some of the General Motors cars i hadn't really even if you if you put them side by side and i i didn't really notice it until someone pointed it out he says well if you'll look and see what's happening yeah foreign cars are able to keep the same gas or keep keep good gas mileage good reliability but they're scaling up whereas the Americans now are scaling down and they can't improve the gas mileage anymore so the Japanese the Japanese have have definitely beat us in both sides of the game yeah they they thought you know build them small cheap and you know and and little repair and you know get them hooked and then start slowly adding stuff on moving them up and people like the reliability but they also like the size and now they're sizing up they've got the reliability and they've got the gas mileage you know and i don't i don't think people mind too much taking the car in for a a tune-up you know just general fifteen thousand mile maintenance or or even getting the oil changed if they know that they're not going to have any other major problems that they'll have to pay for on top of that that's right and with American cars and the warranties you don't know what did they used to say Ford stood for fix or repair daily yeah except i've got a Ford truck and i know a lot of people that have Ford trucks and really they're very maintenance free well that's great from i now i i i speaking only from trucks i wonder why they can't extend the truck's you know reliability out to the cars i mean i don't know i don't know that's surprising surprising because you know everybody i know that has a Ford car has had nothing but trouble with it but they they have a Ford truck and they're they're virtually uh flawless that's weird the uh the the undercarriage and everything else if you put them next to a Chevy or or another type of truck American truck you can't even come close to a Ford really and uh that's why i buy Ford trucks mine runs like a top it it i've like i say i've had absolutely nothing wrong with it other than taking it in for normal maintenance and uh and i i put over a hundred miles a day on it man and i've never i've never had trouble with it that's great so i'll buy Ford trucks but i'll buy foreign cars i think they need to uh take a look at and see what they can't figure out what the catch is there i know it's it's it's kind of kind of crazy but i don't know but but until they until they meet the standards that you know that i'm used to anyway that you know i'll i'll buy what whatever i get you know that's best for my money yeah and you know like i said i've had i've had great luck with the Hondas and it's kind of hard to walk away from a good thing when it's you know you're not sure what you're going to get when you change yeah they're they're good cars i i i will say that you probably made a good choice yeah in that one but how about have you had tires changed on on that car i had the um tires changed at fifty two thousand they had they had started to look to look pretty bald um-hum did you put the same kind of tires back on it did you no um let's see i had  okay so what do you think is the major cause well i i definitely think it's our the cars we drive and yeah i think you know everyone has good intentions and and thinks well i should carpool and i will and but that we just have so many different interests and so many different things we have to do it's it's a bother to have to pick somebody up and if you have a doctor's appointment or something and they have to get another ride home or right you have to arrange it's just a hassle and i guess we're not willing to do that yeah but that to me is probably the thing that needs to be done or to start using public now do you live in a major city Dallas Dallas area i live in Plano in Dallas okay which is just a a suburb of of Dallas do you live in a major city right uh i live in Raleigh North Carolina oh okay and probably not quite as big as Dallas but uh no well myself i i go to Richardson which is a i teach school and so i don't commute that far it's only about four miles but the majority of people that live in this area go into Dallas to work and and when you if you go out on the freeway and you look you see almost every car is just one passenger yeah and our public transportation system's a joke so people just don't bother to take that because it's inconvenient we don't have any kind of a a train or uh you know anything like some of the big cities do oh um-hum right we're supposed to get one but it's you know way off in the future way off yeah but no it's just it well i've found the easiest way is to is to ride bikes in Raleigh anyway and oh is that right i used to live in Colorado and it was even more of a bigger deal there but um sure i ride my bike everywhere in town well there i probably wouldn't ride it to the the opposite side of town but i can ride it to downtown with no problem at all how large is Raleigh it's about two hundred and fifty thousand so it's pretty big yeah uh the diameter of the city is probably it's got a belt line around it which is a a diameter of about ten twelve miles uh-huh and so you ride your bike to work and everything or aren't you oh well that's great right which is about three and a half four miles see that's that isn't even i mean i'm not sure that a person even a percentage of of of people in the Dallas area ride bikes to work you know i just don't think they do i never see anybody yeah um-hum um another thing that that i think our my family's real conscious of is is is to stop using aerosol cans and you know uh you know get another find another way instead of right yeah that one so easy i don't know why people won't you know the pump i know it really is and we just need not to buy the stuff and those businesses will have to change you know the corporations and so forth have to change if you don't buy it they're not going to make it so yeah yeah yeah that is an easy one yeah but uh you know and i notice probably a lot of uh commercial pollution and and factory pollution in Dallas you can see it some days it's really bad yeah you can see it in Raleigh it's ugly yeah it's yeah it's awful it's nothing like California where the smog is constant but it's still there and you know it yeah if we i think if we really realized how much we do breathe in that's unhealthy we would immediately do something about it but i don't think people realize how unhealthy the the air is yeah yeah that's what you said you're a school teacher yes um how much how how much education of air pollution and all that do you well i think i don't see i only teach English and and uh but the science teacher i teach fifth grade and we're departmentalized and okay the science teacher does a really big unit on it and i think the kids are more informed than adults are i mean and right yeah i would i would agree with that because i've done actually i've done some volunteer teaching on on uh ecology and all that at at a middle school uh-huh uh-huh and um the the kids knew well the teacher the science teachers were pretty sharp too but the kids in general know more than adults do about it uh-huh they do they do and they and and i think that they are they care a little bit more and i think as adults we need to care because it's the the future for our kids and i yeah you know i mean my kids are much more aware than i was at their age about things like that and i think it's it's definitely has to be that right well it probably at your age it wasn't a problem no it really wasn't it wasn't a problem it i mean it probably i'm sure it was beginning to be a problem but people were just weren't yeah uh aware of it like they are today and i think that's where it has to start with the kids because it's going to be their world soon and i think it and and we're real big on you know Plano which is a small suburb of Dallas about a hundred thousand yeah um-hum okay um i think we're more than that about a hundred thirty thousand now but um they're really trying their best to start recycling and things like that that will right and we just we have separate garbage collections now for plastics and cans and newspaper and which i think is i mean that's that should be just a way of life for everybody you shouldn't even complain about it you should just do it right right i think they ought to well the way it used to be was that you had you had to take your recycles to a special place it should be the other way around where you have to take your non recyclables to a special place and then people would uh-huh that's true would have an incentive you're right you're right yeah Raleigh has has curbside recycling which is really nice well you know it just has to be when you consider the landfills we we're not going to have any soon and it's yeah it's ridiculous but the thing the quandary that i'm in is that that we had a great big article in in in the newspaper last week about i've been real big about going to to the store and asking for paper instead of plastic well right that is really controversial because some scientists you know f eel like plastic i mean paper is worse than plastic it's just it's just a real um debate about which one is is the best really the best thing to do is to bring um you know a cloth bag yeah yeah yeah your own bag i do that sometimes but i i forget a lot do you yeah i see that's what i do too i forget and and besides when i go to the store i have a family you know i i get maybe ten twelve bags of groceries and that would be a little a little expensive although you know i'm sure some yeah i think i i don't know i think the paper's still got to be better because well the the major problem with paper usually is when they bleach it the dioxins they just usually end up getting dumped into the water supply um-hum but um the grocery bags with them being colored or being raw paper i don't see that much of a problem as opposed to a petroleum product i mean tree trees can grow back if if they're handled in the correct way but the petroleum products like plastic i mean they're going to run out of oil whatever they're going to do yeah um-hum it doesn't grow yes that's right that's right you're right i mean that's that's where the main that's where i see that paper's got to be better uh-huh well you know and they say that you know plastic is recyclable but not many people use them again you know no it's and plastic like that is not a hundred percent recyclable it they lose a lot and it takes a lot of energy to do it yeah that's true sure sure i think that you know i think that it's tremendous the research they're doing on all of this because i think we need to to know and be more aware of it so we can do some changing but yeah the majority of people are so lazy about it that they're not willing to to sacrifice a little to to make the world a better place and it's kind of sad because especially if you have children and because you know you want yeah your kids and their kids to to be able to have a nice place to live yeah be a part of a yeah a world that's halfway decent and you know just in my lifetime i've seen such a change in the environment and it's scary because by the time my kids have kids and they're growing up it's going to be a completely different world you know and it's it's scary so yeah you know like i i know that i need to carpool and i don't and uh and i you rationalize and say well i only am four miles away and that it's no big deal and um-hum yeah well you know but i guess the the first step is to find a happy medium i mean you could easily say well we should go back to living in caves but no one's going to do that so i think you need to make compromises slowly enough people adjust to it and uh right right not too slowly but well you know just yeah just with with our thing in Plano it had when recycling garbage it hasn't it hasn't been that long and it was just uh really an easy adjustment for most people but there was a few small percentage that griped and complained and wrote yeah you know letters to the editor and you know like it was some real great big deal inconvenience and um but it seems to me you should just be able to give up a little bit to make the world better but some people don't think that so yeah and some people don't and some people i think really believe and maybe they're rationalizing but they really believe that everybody's making a bigger deal out of the problem than it is no way yeah and that and that it's right no way it's it's there and we've got to face it i think they're not making a big enough deal about it that's right i think in some cases they aren't yeah and i see i wonder how i wonder how much the laws that Congress passed several years ago are really enforced as far as big companies and yeah well i think there's a lot of violations that slip under the table oh i think so too and i think that they're not fined the way they should be or they're they pay them off or whatever so they can get away with it yeah i i was born in Ohio and when um when i was young we did we did a lot of fishing and on Lake Erie and i i mean when i went back um-hum right i just couldn't believe the difference it's just terrible the way it's polluted because of of big corporations that dump and you know and you just feel so bad because at one time it was a wonderful beautiful lake and now it's a mess right hum i've i've never known it to be one so i guess i'm a little bit younger than you yeah i when i was little my dad had a boat and we would go fishing on Lake Erie and it was beautiful um-hum and it's not beautiful anymore so and that's um  okay um i think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service because it it seems like and i'm i'm thinking of the community of community of people that are in jail now i think that maybe if if if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done because they would they understand people more they understand helping people more they understand the plight of people that's true um-hum i agree with you in the sense that uh i think that it's important for people to uh also share give something of themselves right and uh i think that there's too much in the in uh a way of like self-gratification today um-hum um-hum and there's not enough sharing um-hum i would think that for like people that are just filthy filthy rich uh-huh i think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they can see and i'm i'm speaking about people that are like born rich yeah uh-huh and that's all they know and i'm thinking that community service would help them uh just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living you know if they were to work in in uh uh yeah i don't know in a soup kitchen or something they would understand how other people live yeah uh-huh and uh you know on the same note if poor if poorer people uh were working to to serve the community i don't know they probably have a better perspective of of i don't know just life itself yeah and i think the Peace Corps is great too because uh it you go to different countries and you see um-hum uh you know in fact i saw an interview on TV the other night with uh Patrick Swayze and he's making a movie in um-hum i think it's uh Calcutta or either India somewhere where it's a it's a very poor poor country um-hum um-hum and he said that people in the West he said since being there and i guess he's been there about six months he said that his whole idea of what's important has changed um-hum um and he said that people have no idea he said of of what human sacrifice is you know since being there he's he's learned to what it is to be poor and have nothing and yet those people have uh such uh a happy um-hum demeanor yeah um-hum uh yeah in in other words they don't dwell on on what they don't have they dwell on what they do have and they're happy with each other type of thing right that's great and he said that out here he said that when he comes back he knows that it it's just completely changed his life um-hum and i i think that that you know this on the same note being he was exposed to that and maybe he wasn't before and now he sees and i think that anybody that works right exactly in the in some kind of service or for the community or something they can see you know you don't see what you don't you can't know what you don't see uh-huh exactly right you know so and you have to experience some things you know a lot of people know that people that other people are poor yeah but you they don't know what poor is right unless they actually see it and you know help or something uh-huh well i i know that it that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of uh you know helping them learn how to survive how to plant how to find water and i've seen so many uh um-hum um-hum extraordinary things on TV that people have done um-hum working in the Peace Corps and how you know uh the people or the community they worked in is so much better um-hum it's like one person can make a difference right and i i really believe that they can in something like that there's something i i've really been skeptical of you know when you watch television you'll see the service announcement for children in other countries uh-huh and if you want to send like you know fifty cents a day yes or something like that and you can help a child uh-huh it's i don't know i guess it's just me but i don't know whether to trust that or not i mean there are so many scams and things going on you know i would love to help somebody i know and how do you yeah you know but i just i can't bring myself to trust right this this company who's trying to do this or whatever it is uh-huh you know just because people are so i don't know just today people are just so money hungry that i think they would do anything i know it's true it really is it's the sad life i think today it's um and so i mean you don't know what they um-hum it's it it's not like it used to be even in in the years of my growing up i mean i'm fifty three years old and i have seen a town change from a town to a city um-hum um-hum um-hum and it's uh people you know grow from a small town to a large town um-hum and you would think that more people would be better you know share more do more you know be more community oriented and all but if they just get more uh um-hum right unto themselves kind of yeah more self-centered um right and and it's not the sharing of uh a neighbor to a neighbor um-hum um-hum and we would go out and not even lock our doors um-hum and not even worry about it but you can't do that today but today i mean you know it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that um-hum if you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know yeah even when when i first moved to Dallas from New York it seemed like Dallas was so open you know everybody left their doors open you just run in the store you leave your car running uh-huh yeah yeah you know and this was only uh well i guess it has been awhile it's been almost ten years since i moved here and it's amazing now now how much it's changed i mean i don't go out i don't go outsid e at night you know yeah in Dallas they i was going to say because i i heard uh in fact i was talking to someone from Dallas uh just last week they was saying that uh in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for TI and she had gone over seas to Tokyo um-hum um-hum and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she shouldn't go because she was alone you know being a girl from another country and everything um-hum um-hum and she said they thought for a few seconds and they said uh no there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid they said to her that even if she left her purse hum on the subway um-hum okay that she would have that purse returned to her this is how confident they were okay with nothing missing wow wow okay this is a foreign country better um-hum and you would think you know uh being uh an American or whatever you know a foreigner there that that would be all the more reason that they'd take advantage of you um-hum um oh God that would be the exact opposite here i mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it okay and she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in in and around Dallas um-hum um-hum and that's where she was from um-hum that is sad she said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone yeah yeah that that's a big that's a big thing with me i live in a one bedroom i'm single you know she had there are certain uh-huh and i've i could live in an apartment i live in Waco okay and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments oh yeah yeah and i live i don't make a lot of money but i live in the high price apartments simply because i feel safe here yeah and i pay i'm paying probably the hundred or hundred and fifty dollars more than i would be paying somewhere else but i wouldn't be able to sleep at night and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be you know i feel very safe where i am yeah yeah yeah you know instead of and that that's why i think if people were more exposed to um-hum uh especially uh young kids getting out of high school um-hum i mean at one time they would go into the service to have the same exposure and you know uh to further their worldliness so to speak um-hum right and go to see uh foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see it was like they said join the Navy to see the world type of thing you know um-hum right right but nowadays they don't do that anymore it's not uh a thing uh a lot of young men don't even uh um-hum have the desire to go into the service yeah they don't even consider it or to uh you know do something for someone else um-hum yeah and it and i don't know i i attributed i think a lot of that to women working to you know to mothers not being at home yes yes i was talking to someone yesterday about that and we were saying that the basic uh the the basic family is is disrupted these days the bonding process yep it very definitely is and so i think you know before the father would work and the mother you know would stay home and having that mother there that base i think was a big part of of family big part of that's right of what you know your your uh youngsters thought about what they did you know yep and the thing is like i think a man can afford to support a woman but the woman affords the luxuries um-hum in in other words like anyone can live on a certain income no matter what it is you have to um-hum right right so to speak okay it it's what's important to you um-hum now a family i i think that like girls today have children and six weeks later they're back to work um-hum right they don't even have a bonding with that child they don't ever ever see the um-hum it's it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child the first like say six years of life um-hum um-hum so much happens in that period of time when i called and i mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three um-hum big deal i mean they're they're in school you're at work that's great but it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and the right right  all right okay what uh what baseball teams do you follow i follow i've been a long time Cincinnati Reds fan because when i was growing up and i was five years old i wanted to be a catcher so i was a big Johnny Bench fan so i was a big Johnny Bench fan so i've been through the Reds with the Reds since you know nineteen seventy uh-huh and i remember the Seventy World Series like i said i was only five years old then but i had to give a report to my dad every because that was when they played World Series games in the afternoons sometimes uh-huh and i've kind of gotten away from them until the last couple of years because i didn't really know many players and their team but i also being from the Indiana area i like the Cubs and the White Sox so i kind of follow those two teams hum yeah a little bit and you know since moving down here the Rangers you know i've been picking up on them a little bit and uh it looks like they could do all right this year and uh of course they're in there with the right White Sox i believe and they're in their division so uh-huh the White Sox headed for probably another good year i hope what about yourself oh i guess mainly the the Rangers such as they are yeah they do seem to have a pretty tough division though with Oakland and Kansas City and White Sox all uh yeah jammed in there yeah do you go to a lot of games oh i get to i don't know quite a few in the summer uh-huh that's i've been looking forward to it i've only been to one game and i just moved down here at the end of last summer so that last season was winding down so i'm hopefully i'll uh get to a couple this year i want to see Nolan pitch one time that that's be that'd be really neat yeah it looked like they're starting off kind of shaky but they they've gone i guess over five hundred now yeah i was hoping that no hitter that he threw would would get them fired up a little bit it might but it's hard hard to tell did they uh play today uh i was trying to think they were up in a stand at Detroit uh-huh i don't know if they're playing today or not yeah that's right that's right yeah i watched a little bit of the i was flipping back and forth between the the Pacers and the Celtics and uh the White Sox game uh-huh that was on today i i just like i like the White Sox i've never really got into them and then this friend of mine was just a hard core White Sox so he took me to a game and you know i think they're you know they're really neat because they're such a young team uh-huh actually the youngest team in baseball and they got some you know the last three or four years their number one picks you know they're all suited up and playing for them yeah and the draft and uh you got to like that you know building the team through draft picks and stuff like that yeah it says a lot for their future yeah it does hopefully some of their players will come through and they got Tim Raines a veteran and they got Carlton Fisk he's you know still pretty solid a lot of experience but uh uh you like the Astros or anything like that oh i don't really follow them a whole lot um i i hear about them occasionally i've got a friend whose a a trainer for one of their farm clubs uh-huh i think so we hear off and on about them they've never really done a whole lot i mean they're up and down kind of like the Rangers are most of the time yeah well when was the last time the Rangers really did well it's been probably three or four years since they were i think they finished second in their division i don't remember what they ended up last year third or fourth i guess yeah so they were contenders till about three or fours years ago yeah they have been off and on uh maybe maybe three or four times since they've been here yeah i don't i never really followed them all i knew uh kind of watched them a little bit in the seventies there again you know cause i was a little catcher in baseball i liked to watch a Jim Sundberg and uh like Jeff Burroughs uh-huh uh forget who else used to play for them but uh yeah those guys were were really tough well they've been like a lot of teams and the minute they do real badly in the past they just got got rid of their manager this is Valentine's the first manager they've had in on you know any kind of length of time yeah and so hopefully he'll eventually put something together you think he's pretty good i i can't i don't know uh sometimes i think he is and sometimes i wonder yeah i was watching the game yesterday and they had had bases loaded and they tried a uh a squeeze play and uh i just couldn't understand that i forget whose who was batting and but uh i don't know i just i couldn't understand that move there was only one out uh-huh and it's like you know give the guy a cut you know you got bases loaded you know one mistake cause a lot of these players aren't used to bunting that much and it's a easy double play yeah true but i guess i was feeling pretty confident about the team Valentine this year until uh he got mad at Pete Incaviglia and just cut him for because he was upset at him you didn't like that move well i i can understand his point i thought it was kind of childish to just cut him instead of trying to trade him because then Detroit picks him up and he started out real good for them and he he's gotten kind of shaky now yeah and i think they should have at least gotten something for him yeah it's true what about uh Sierra you a big Ruben Sierra fan yeah he's been around what four or five years i think so yeah you think you can see him staying there for awhile or yeah i think i think as long as he produces he and Franco they they run kind of hot and cold too yeah i think Franco hit a home run was it last night to win the game oh yeah i'd i turned the game on i don't know who won i think they won six to five and i think that was on his he hit a home run at the end and broke the tie up well good yeah i'm kind of into baseball cards so uh last year i was buying a lot of Juan Gonzalez cards hum so i'm hoping he's going to blossom and make me a rich man someday yeah that'd be nice yeah yeah i think the Rangers have the the pitching staff they need if they would just produce some offense they might do all right yeah well i'm definitely looking forward to going to a few games this summer that's good entertainment at a budget price yeah you said you were a Cincinnati fan has uh all this brouhah a with Pete Rose over the years yeah caused caused you any distaste for them or no you mean like no i mean thing about rose i mean you know that he's got a problem in his personal life i just you know he he messed up but i still think he's belongs in the Hall of Fame and uh-huh yeah and you know he played for so many so well for so many years that sure yeah it's uh it's just too bad it's you know like the players that do drugs or do you know are alcoholics they just have a problem uh-huh and it's too bad it carried over and has hurt his image and everything else well but it didn't didn't seem to really hurt the team in fact seemed to kind of fire them up and make them work harder yeah yeah after he was gone yeah i think Lou Pinella is doing a good job too obviously uh-huh yeah he knows you know he's you know he's been there he's played a lot of ball himself so he's been in some World Series and you know he's a lot of experience as a player and it looks like he's doing all right as a manager uh-huh well thanks for this is the first time i've ever been called so it's kind of interesting yeah i usually get home and pick up the phone and do some calling so uh really but i appreciate your calling sure i enjoyed talking to you Fred all right take care you too bye-bye bye  all right um what kind of recent camping experience do you have well there are several things that we've done as a family um as far as uh when we go on vacation we have four children and so it's difficult sometimes for us to afford the hotel all the time um-hum and so we take our tent and we pitch it and our kids are just great at camping my husband and my son are scouts and are very adept at that kind of thing and so it makes it a successful thing you know we just pitch the tent and we find the campgrounds that have facilities which is really nice because there are a lot of them across the United States now right and um and uh uh like i said our kids are just really good and we have a four year old and even he's not any big problem with it oh that's good yeah yeah i i think it's uh it's a lot of fun uh my camping experiences have been mostly with my son who was in the scouts he's he's huh he thinks he's an adult now but uh we started camping with the cub scouts uh-huh um-hum and uh camped uh you know for several years with the with the Boy Scouts and and went to some of the scout uh camp sites around and we've had really had a good time uh they're nice too with that yeah um and i was a den mother for a while too and uh like they have a thing called Mom and Me and that's right you'd go out with them even the mothers do and camp over night oh yeah um-hum yeah but uh our first uh first camping experience was uh the fathers took the the uh Webelows i guess it was camping uh and we went over to uh a lake over in East Texas and we my son and i borrowed a one of these pop up trailer tents oh how fun and it rained it started raining about the time we left home and it rained uh like that was a Saturday morning and it rained all day Saturday and it was still raining Sunday morning we went over and set up camp and you know stayed there over night we couldn't do anything so as soon as we woke up Sunday morning we you know we had breakfast and then we all came back home um-hum but i think he and i were the only ones that stayed high and dry so to speak yes yeah but uh most of the most of our camping experiences have been you know pup tent type of you know little two men tents on the ground and sleeping in a bed roll you know and that kind of thing so it's uh um-hum we did have a really bad experience uh we went to Corpus Christi one year and um while we were there we uh had camped on kind of a sandy ground area instead of uh the hard firm uh dirt ground um-hum and in the night there came a very um windy type weather and it blew our stakes out and and the the tent fell oh yeah that that that's always bad when the tent falls on you in the middle of the night yeah yeah so that wasn't too exciting but good experience for us to know that we definitely didn't needed to do the stakes into a firm ground yeah right yeah you need to be on higher ground sometime you don't want the if there if it's going to rain you don't want the water to run down into your tents so yeah exactly exactly but uh yeah we had we've had some really good experiences it it's been several years since i've been camping but uh as a matter of fact my son uh is camping now he camps every weekend he uh-huh oh how fun he's uh involved with the uh Scarborough Fair down at Waxahachie and he goes down there on uh Saturday on uh Friday night oh uh-huh and camps and stays uh Friday night and Saturday night and then comes back home after it closes Sunday and stays so so he has a tent that's i guess he's got a permanent tent site for his tent stays down there all week you know and he just goes down and spends the weekend down there well that sounds great yeah so he's really having a good time camping and and you know his experiences that he got from scouting have really you know been good for him uh from that he he lost interest in scouts but he still uses what he learned so see that's that's very nice the only thing i think about camping is when you have to cook outdoors and you don't always have to do that but um we have a dutch oven and and we found some really fun recipes that we can do in that that are quite tasteful yeah yeah you know you uh do you do the cooking in the coals where you wrap everything in foil and we've done that before uh-huh but yeah that's we uh my my wife and i took the uh the scout leadership training program um-hum and we really had a good time with that we did have a uh i guess it was a raccoon that came into our campsite and stole some of the food you know that we didn't have set up i think it actually went into the tent with uh with a couple of ladies that were in our group you know went in an and got stuff out of their tent oh but uh oh jeepers but they uh you know it was uh it was a fun time and we we've enjoyed camping what you know what little we've done uh uh-huh we're not well i think camping is one of those things that you can make memories with so i think it's a wonderful activity and it's just right yeah we uh we went uh one time one time with a uh another group or with the the scouting group but it was the parents uh you know it was a family camp out and one of the things was that uh the uh we had uh uh a couple that were uh from India um and they demonstrated cooking some Indian food out you know on a on a little gas burner type thing out there you know it was part of our our entertainment you know for the thing they cooked some kind of uh um-hum of an Indian uh pastry type thing on a in a skillet skillet you know so it was really it was really interesting we went to uh down to Glen Rose to the uh where the dinosaur tracks are and there's a campsite you know down there in that area that we uh that we went to uh-huh yeah well i'm from Utah and before we moved to Texas and uh um-hum i i see the different kinds of camping there are you know like the mountain camping and then here it's mostly flat land right um-hum and um i'm not sure which i like better it's kind of nice to be on flat land but yeah yeah right well yes but i think you get a more scenic type thing in there so right yeah so if you haven't camped down around at that place down around Glen Rose you might enjoy that uh it's you know it's got some it's got some hills and stuff down there so no i don't think we've ever gone there oh that sounds nice yeah but uh yeah you know well i've enjoyed i t and uh make you make me want to go camping again you know okay thanks well thank you i've enjoyed talking to you well go go go have a good day um bye-bye you too bye-bye  all right uh you have uh pets i understand a couple of them what are they i i well i have uh these well i don't know if they consider themselves animals anymore they actually you know sort of take over the place and and we're kind of their pets pets get like that don't they they think they own you they don't they really they own the place and naturally these are cats so okay these are cats i remember one time uh i used to get a chuckle out of out of Pogo that dates me quite a bit you probably don't know Pogo oh Pogo sure yeah he when Beauregard was talking he was the dog remember and he used to say pets can be most as much trouble as kids uh-huh as kids if they work at it a little bit may and even more when they work at it a little bit and i think that's true actually i agree i don't know i i i think that um my husband and i are in such a situation that uh um i'm kind of um not able to do a lot i'm i'm kind of in a wheelchair and i mean i kind of am but um oh uh-huh yeah i've got these two cats that hang around with me all day and i don't what i'd do without them they just good company huh that's neat it is and you know it's funny how pets get to be so they really you you really do mourn them after when things happen now we don't actually have a pet right now the okay but uh but we have had some and and i can't it's it's always hard for me to believe how close i've gotten to them we had a little uh um oh dog it was a little uh i got it so it wouldn't wouldn't shed one of French poodle a little French poodle oh my oh really yeah and uh he used to i used to come down stairs in the morning to feed him you know and i'd let him up out of the basement where he was sleeping and he would just dance around the floor and i just got and we only had him about three or four weeks before he was hit by a car but i cannot believe the whole family just oh oh he just got in to to us so quickly i could not believe it that yeah that's i i have to tell you about our most interesting pet though okay uh we had an iguana living with us for about uh oh about two years oh by choice two and a half years i guess it was about uh oh three feet long about three feet long it was a beautiful animal name was Clyde Clyde the Iguana Clyde the Iguana and uh my son Dan went to uh to uh Hawaii for the summer and when he came home uh he didn't bring the iguana with him but for some reason or other he had a thing for them i don't know whether he'd i think there was one in the school uh zoology department you know uh-huh or biology department one or the other anyway uh and anyway he just he went and found this guy in in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in i guess in Texas in Mexico i don't know where but anyway he brought this home and i looked at him and i said you've got to be kidding i'm not going to live with a lizard but you know i visualize that animal racing about and you know like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that they're very much like uh well the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes did you have him in a cage no he had full run of the house he just loved to sit on the back of my dryer where the hair the heat came up out of the dryer you know it was he was really a neat pet and though i oh no oh no oh no uh-huh you know he'd ride when we'd have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and the fire would be burning he'd walk across my feet sometimes and it it was a long time before i could really pet him and oh but i fed him and he he knew how to get me to feed him he'd come out to the kitchen just kind of look at me till i went and got him something out of the refrigerator uh oh no i mean you don't argue with an iguana do you but he was really a neat animal he he'd lay in Dan's lap you know and just uh when he'd pet him he'd just stretch and you know you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does oh no it was kind of interesting but he did a lot of interesting things and uh Dan carried him around and he liked to ride on the back of his up on his head you know with his tail wrapped around his arm so he wouldn't fall off and and scare everybody to death and oh my goodness goodness kids loved him kids just loved him kids just came from all over to come and see Clyde and visit with him and and he tolerated them you know he'd even tolerate him petting though he didn't like them too well at first but he he got tame you know so that uh people could go in there and Dan was a drummer uh-huh and he didn't he the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming when Dan would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up you know like he was trying to hi protect himself and then he'd leave the room was the drumming and cover his ears isn't that funny the way we put you know um human characteristics on an animal like that and and oh yeah they really are they're interesting well they take on human characteristics like as a it's i guess they do uh our other animal the next year our our son Ken went to Hawaii and well while Dan was in Hawaii Ken decided he wanted a dog and he and he looked around a long while and he found a Norwegian elkhound oh and he just brought this Norwegian elkhound and home and he was so funny uh for a while they built a a run for him out to the side of the house you know he'd been on the patio but they put the run out there and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him and one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him and and Hal and i were in bed and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house and and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air huh he used a classic illusion and then bark and march around you know and then he'd pick up his dish again and throw it in the air until we came out and gave him some water oh i forgot to ask you did the iguana catch flies for you did what did the iguana catch flies for you no he didn't eat flies no they eat uh they greens uh we fed him the outside leaves of lettuce you know i'd get lettuce at the store and he'd eat the outside leaves he didn't eat flies oh oh and then in the summertime you could put him out and he'd eat outside oh except you had to keep him away from the garden because he liked to eat the little peas as fast as they came up you know yeah i bet it was really it was really a glamor and of things that were fresh sprigs you know he liked that well can we ask you whatever happened to Clyde but well yeah when uh when Dan went to college up at Ricksun Idaho he took him with him oh and uh everybody was used to him and they just loved him and what not and this his roommate put him out one day and Dan didn't know it and it got dark and he didn't get him in again and they searched and searched and searched for him but uh oh uh it got too cold up there and he he died in a tree that they found him the next day in a tree he was dead oh my so you can't you have to be pretty tender with them we had a he had his own heat lamp and uh and uh hot pad he laid on you know that was another funny thing he had a hot pad and it it burned up one time and boy it was that was funny too watching him kind of burned up but anyway and we got him a new one he had a blue one before and when we got him a new one it was brown and he wouldn't lay on it till we changed the covers oh really no he wouldn't lay on it because that was like what he was used to but so they really are they really pick up things he was he was a clean animal uh we had he went to the bathroom in the bathroom how did he do that put well we put some papers on the floor underneath the john and he went there to go to the bathroom okay you had to be sure you left the doors open you know he didn't like to go anywhere else he'd he'd scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door if you happened to close it on him or something you know but oh no but even when he went when he had an accident or something uh if you just let it dry it dries kind of like uh especially when he was inside and eating just lettuce it dried up a little bit like ashes and you could just vacuum it up oh my goodness in the winter time there was no smell at all no odor at all to it in the summertime when he was outside and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat you know oh yeah but uh but that that's incredible it's a different little things to yeah he's a he was a really interesting animal oh that's i i just uh we just really and you know to this day i still miss him and that's been years ago well see i guess it's because you lived with you know him an and overcame some fears to get used to him and yeah he was just yeah yeah i think i guess so but it it it was interesting well yeah definitely what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you pet them oh my goodness these guys they well actually they're my husband's pets yeah oh and you just kind of took them over huh well well actually it's like he's the cat person you know and i have i was always kind of nondescript in that category because i always liked dogs um-hum uh-huh and they've kind of taken over and and uh you know they a little bit easier to have cats in this kind of country though isn't it uh maybe it is i they're so independent well i'm glad we have two of them otherwise i think they get neurotic if there just one of them well i think yeah that could be could be they get real crazy but there brother brother and sister from the same litter they look totally different they are they well they are Siamese cats but one is oh pretty ones one is uh um they're both registered you know one's a seal point she's the little girl and then uh Newhart Newhart is the uh the Newhart the he is something he's like a dog he really he just flops for you he just wants his belly scratched and that's it you know yeah and he's just the warmest thing in the wintertime he just sits on your lap sits on your lap but they're like seven years yeah  uh the clothing i guess that uh i wanted to talk about is the different uh uh types of wardrobe that one might need to have in the kind of job or well i think that you probably have a full-time job if you're a college student a full-time do you consider that full-time i consider a full-time college student i don't consider it really a job but i guess in a way it would be i never really thought about it well do you um do you have a kind of wardrobe i suppose you do that is suitable for almost all the year or do you change quite a bit during the seasons um oh my everyone pretty much well like in the winter everyone more more susceptible to the sweatshirts and you know the big heavy sweaters uh-huh and basically everyone wears jeans but in the summer everyone's basically in shorts and sometimes we still do wear sweatshirts with our shorts you know uh-huh sure so um i would just say the only difference is you know like long sleeve and short sleeve between summer and winter yes yes um what year are you in college i'm a senior okay well uh what i might uh suggest since i have had a working career at the present time i'm not working but it was so helpful to me you do plan probably to work when you receive your degree yes yes and what are you receiving it in finance finance well my husband is a financial person uh-huh uh-huh uh but when i worked i tended to uh be confused a lot at first and tried i would get things out of the closet and oh that wouldn't do and this wouldn't do i just seemed to have more clothes than i could wear uh-huh or that i wanted to wear and i went and had that uh Color Me Beautiful thing done uh-huh and uh in fact i did it really that part just for fun because i have gotten her book before are you aware aware of that book no well it uh tells you what colors really are best on you uh-huh and uh what season you are winter spring you you heard people talk about that yeah um i've had one of those things done for like makeup and stuff okay Well i did it uh primarily for clothing because um i have dark hair and kind of sallow reddy complexion and um those beige good looking cashmere beige suits that i wanted so badly were horrible on me um-hum and so when i got this color test done for clothing i found out that that's probably the worst color i can wear so i started buying only those colors that were good for a winter and i'm a winter uh-huh and um so after about uh and and i was working and i added a few things to my wardrobe uh in the colors that i out that i already to the colors that i already had that i could wear plus i bought some and do you know it made traveling and working so much more simple uh-huh because and i i did away with all those colors that like the beige blouses i couldn't wear i can wear white but i couldn't wear beige uh-huh so i got rid of all those i mean i hated to get rid of those suits and pantsuits that were a hundred and fifty knowing how much money you spent on them really but i didn't look people would say have you been feeling well lately when i would wear those beige suits uh-huh so it made it so much more simple for me to have everything pretty much in one color family For instance i wear burgundy well uh-huh and uh purple and hot pinks well very often those can be combined combined and navy blues and whites so when i travel for a week i really would only have to take one pair of shoes a suit several blouses an extra shirt or two uh-huh and it was so much simpler if you will think about that yeah well see um i'm i'm a cool person they call they and they i think that's relates to the same thing as the winter uh-huh and the summer is the warmer colors and i i pretty much wear the same colors you just described i wear a lot of navy blues uh-huh um i wear a lot of like a magenta or a hot pink color you know and and in those shades yes exactly uh-huh um i wear a lot of greens though too uh-huh uh-huh you know just the the darker greens i don't like wearing the light greens uh-huh and uh black and maroon and you know i wear the darker colors yeah yeah yes well now when you start have you started interviewing for jobs yet no i haven't um well when you start interviewing for jobs and if you do put in some quite a bit of money in your clothing keep that in mind because those those pieces of clothing will do you probably for several years oh yeah i already started buying suits and i've already you know i've bought the suits that i always wear colors in so yeah uh-huh uh-huh well that's that's very smart uh-huh well i i have we exhausted our subject i've talked so much why don't you uh uh tell me uh what kind of if you had an interview tomorrow what would you probably wear uh-huh what would i wear uh-huh i have um this suede suit it's a double breasted coat with a skirt and i have a number of different blouses i could wear with it one blouse that looks really nice with it is a real deep red blouse uh-huh sounds pretty well i read an article in the uh Charlotte paper yesterday from one of the fashion experts here uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh who said that stockings um are also not given enough emphasis uh it choose we don't choose them uh quite so well and it says that suntan really doesn't g o with everything uh-huh yeah and try to get one of the experts uh where you buy uh nice stockings to tell you the color to wear with outfits um-hum uh uh in fact she doesn't give white a real high grade no i don't even wear white stockings with this just because it's just too much white with the white shoes and everything it's too white isn't it yes uh-huh i wear i wear the tan uh-huh uh-huh you know or the nude or whatever you want to call it yeah yeah or i think uh i don't know what is that a white white suit or is it a kind of creamy white it's really different it's not quite it's it's not what you would call really an off-white and it's i don't think it's a real white white either you know well it probably looks good on you then but since it's not very off-white uh-huh well anyway i thought that i it was the first time i had ever read an article on stockings or or panty hose or whatever you call them these days and um-hum but it did say that uh uh they really pretty much needed to be uh they need to look good with uh the skirt and the shoes and you count you think of it as a total outfit um-hum yeah but it said also they find that navy skirt and navy stockings and navy shoes are very boring yeah that would just be too much oh gosh uh-huh well it's been fun talking to you it was nice talking to you too and i hope uh it would be nice i'm getting to talk to some of the same people oh really yes and i i understand we need some more guys to talk to so you might uh leave a message if you know any guys that want to do this oh okay okay you have you have a nice day bye-bye okay thank you you too bye-bye  so i personally uh do consider the Soviet Union a threat i i i think that although there's been some fundamental changes and that there's uh uh the uh the mood for change that there's a lot of change left to happen and that there's still uh communism which is fundamentally opposed to democracy and there's still missiles um-hum yeah yeah well i mean that's that's certainly true i guess i'm i'm confused uh by what it means to be a threat to the United States and so i'm not sure i even recognize the United States as anything to be threatened um oh really the uh i guess the main issue is is that it it seems to me that the Soviet Union is breaking up into it's own internal problems yes um and it would certainly be nice if the various um republics seceded on the other hand i also think it would be very nice if the various states in our union seceded uh but that's beside the point uh right and it's much less than clear to me that as a military power um there's going to be anything left uh given that anything like that happens right uh they've got enough problems keeping their own people happy to worry about you know nuking other people who aren't bothering them right well i guess that that that brings up a question is it their i think in in the long term we could see a a situation where there are in incredible civil wars and that the the structure of the country breaks down and there's strife and much much death um-hum but until that happens between between now and then there's a lot of other uh events that could happen including a resurgence of communism with uh violent uh backlash against democracy which which is where we could be in threatened i guess you'd say i guess i'm communist why is why is communism antiethical to democracy i can understand why it's antiethical to capitalism i'm sorry you you're right i'm am meaning to say capitalism okay uh all right but we've already got a lot of anticapitalism in this country yes that's true uh-huh um but not necessarily enough from the Soviet Union's people's point of view that could be that could be i yeah uh but certainly the latest rumors in Congress right now is let's soak the rich some more so we can spread out the money yeah and that's certainly communism as far as i can tell right uh so um you know they might be perfectly happy to sit back and wait for it to happen that's right um and they so so i guess since the primary question is whether or not it's a military problem that's less than clear to me i mean if they're smart they're just going to let us head toward communism on our own very merry way that's right and there seems to be enough people in our country who are happy to do that sort of thing because they think they'd get more out of it that way right um-hum um so from that point of view i don't consider them a threat i see i don't think they're going to you know somehow import communism to us i i agree with that i don't believe that will happen the um well one thing that's current of interest is is if the Soviet Union's structure does break down and there is civil war at the end of those civil wars or during those civil wars in whose hands will those missiles be um-hum right and there are a lot of them uh scattered throughout the many many republics that's true that's that can be a frightening thought right almost a terroristic thought um yep yep you know come help us or we'll bomb you yeah um of course that's not a good way to win friends but yeah i mean i i think there's also the whole third world issue uh with him that's with uh the Soviet Union having um supported uh Iraq right uh previously and and so there there's a whole lot of political possibilities um but you know just just to put this in perspective i mean George Bush was recently in the hospital and so for a moment Dan Quayle might have been uh having his finger on the trigger and God knows what that would have done uh that's right i know it's almost amazing how little you hear about Dan Quayle and when you do it's usually totally yeah it's a joke yeah yeah he still wants to send people to Mars right the guy's uh lame lame lame lame to say the least yeah oh well so that's uh what what's going to be real interesting is if when they have the next presidential elections um-hum if Bush is going to run with Quayle again yeah or if he's going to run with someone else which i think would be uh i wonder if that's if there's precedent for that where uh there's uh same president but a different vice president uh i think so i can't think off hand who is it but without something like death or impeachment yeah i i i can't recall i mean i just can't imagine voting for anybody that has Quayle on their ticket yeah that's right i guess in the last elections it was it was the lesser of several evils but from the right and also he was basically unknown so i mean you're just like okay so it's it's Bush and somebody else yeah that's right yeah oh well so let's see back to the that key issue uh um-hum the the other part of the question was what would uh what would have to happen to convince me right right and i'd say seems to me uh that the missiles are the threat um-hum and so what would have to happen is a complete disarmament um-hum uh and uh that's i you know i'd love to see that happen but i doubt it's going to happen in the next fifty years you don't think so i don't no personally i i i really as i said i would really love to see it happen but i just i just i can't see them maintaining the missile bases in fact i think if the Soviet government starts retreating you know because of these civil wars and stuff the first thing they're going to do is close down the mi ssile bases in the republics um-hum oh under the fear because they're not going to want them to fall into the Republic's hands i see under the fear that that uh Moscow Moscow gets bombed first that's a good point that's a very good point in fact might be used against them that's right and so i think just from that there's going to be some limited amounts of disarmament they'll still be republics with the missiles the ones that are under the firmer control of the of the Soviets right uh but certainly you know like Lithuania and stuff i think would lose the irs yes i see that's a good great point okay well so so it was good talking to you yeah it was nice talking to you too Brian good day bye-bye okeydoke bye  okay um the one of the things that i've heard uh many people complain about the school systems was that they didn't feel like uh people were dedicated to teaching their children uh-huh or their heart really wasn't in it you know so what they went and got a degree and and everything but it wasn't their not doing it just because they want to are you saying the teachers or the parents the teachers the teachers uh-huh you know well how do you feel about that well i guess i have mixed emotions on one hand i think golly the pay isn't good enough if you didn't really want to do it yeah you shouldn't be doing it's probably something else out there but on the other hand i think that maybe some people have thought that was kind of an easy way out you can major in something basically useless to the world as a whole like say Spanish or geography geography being one of my favorite subjects but uh-huh yeah oh really nevertheless it's not exactly the thing that's going to make you bucks right but you could then go ahead and get a teaching certificate and perhaps feed your family a little yeah what do you think about the the recent bill that was just passed you know where uh they're taking the money from especially the the Dallas area you're calling from Texas then school oh oh yeah i'm in Dallas Texas i'm in Plano okay yeah they're taking uh the money from our schools here and distribute it some of the other outlying and and especially like west Texas what um-hum um-hum what do you think about that because it's it's you know the money's coming from us here that live here and work here and well i have always believed in sharing uh-huh you know if my neighbor next door was hungry and they needed something to eat or something to wear i'd be glad to share and so i guess in the global sense you have to have that kind of feeling to a certain extent but right i also don't believe that people who get funds or equipment or anything without some of their own personal input uh-huh take care of it nicely or appreciate it or use it properly right uh those things have to be taught excuse me yeah i agree you know so you know so there's that end of it too and and i think it's going to really you know so i don't i don't say that in a selfish way because i think there that it's probably not totally equitable yeah and i don't know that there is a good situation entirely but golly yeah it sure going to make a big difference in our school system yeah it is you know it uh i was um-hum i was talking to a friend in Irving who sits on a parents advisory council with the Irving Independent School District and she was saying they are number one Plano yeah they are adding next year they are adding thirty minutes to their school day uh-huh in order to accommodate the extra teaching that's going to be needed because they're eliminating all aids they're going to they all aids all paid aids everything is going to have to be volunteer through the parent teacher organizations oh really uh-huh uh-huh and frankly we're all ready maxed out with parent you know uh volunteer yeah work i work part-time out of my home and they did you know uh-huh i'm always getting called and you know and used utilized you know what i'm willing to do it but i know during the days when i was uh just not a working mom at all it was ridiculous yeah yeah they call you all the time uh yeah yeah until i just finally had to say i am so sorry that you know just cannot do everything for you um-hum yeah but uh i agree you know so there's and and the moms that work a lot of times just can't help at all and yeah right well i i i believe that the school puts a big demand on the students on the teachers and the students for for the fact that they expect the parents to go out and a lot of times chauffeur or lot of times you know buy a lot of things that might seem unnecessary but i it's unreal on the cost of sending a kid to school because of you know you spend your time voluntary and um-hum plus you buy a lot of extra arts crafts aids things like that notebooks for reports so many yes well and just you know the yearbook and the T-shirt and the teachers presents and the you know it really starts right you know we have five children so i know that it really projects oh my goodness so you really do yeah like uh all types of projects little bug things you know that you know um-hum i just helped a little girl yesterday a teenager friend of ours she had to prepare something for to study Greece uh-huh and they were i think she needed a recipe and the history of of the recipe or the type of food and also um had to actually make it and bring it enough to serve you know fifteen people and i found the cheapest thing i could find that i could help her with and even so figuring it up i think she spent close to twenty dollars oh my gosh yeah um and it was say you know we did a couple of different ones and it was the least expensive and uh-huh and still be able to fix it at home and tote it up there and what not so right but that's that's amazing because if if every child does that what are they going to do with all that yeah it's a lot of money yeah and would they really eat it of course that's not really you know the quality of education yeah um-hum but you know i think that probably you know here in Plano we are uh of course state legislature you know added uh five days next year right and uh i think we're going to be seeing alternative calendar very soon i i'm still basically against it although i i do understand the positives uh-huh that are you know touted but i think overall how do you feel about the Plano school system you feel like it's pretty good compared to the others surround you know Richardson and Allen and there is a quality of excellence expected here it's very difficult for the children in this school district to excel in more than one area right because if you get into drama if you get into speech if you get into drill team or athletics or whatever it is i mean they want you night and day they want your time they want your blood oh really yeah money and you know so and uh you know i have children who been fortunate enough to be in in these extra curricular things but golly you know it's just really you know it's like a smaller school system you know you could be in the drill team and you could be cheerleader too and you could be you know on the football team and still be on the basketball team and still try out for band you know real demanding basketball right yeah that's amazing so you know that and you you can't do that in this school system so you know we've been working on college stuff for my oldest daughter and shoot you know that's a that's a big difference uh-huh that uh you know you kind of you know you have to to look when we were writing things down i said you know you can't really talk about all your individual things but you know you've got to make sure that when you put down band here that it's not just any old band that this is a band that took this honor and that honor and participated in this competition and participated in that competition so they understand really uh-huh right right that's wild well it's been good talking to you well yeah this is uh this is interesting interesting topic thank you uh good night bye-bye thank you Jackie have a good day bye-bye  okay what i was gonna to tell you about is that my fiance and i have just finished as a matter of fact today restoring a seventy three Mercedes you don't mean it i i we've done a little bit of it ourselves but mostly we were lucky enough to find a a guy that works for a Mercedes dealership and he restores cars on his on his uh you know off time um-hum how'd you find this one well it was uh a gentleman that works with my fiance and he had bought it for his daughter and she wasn't taking care of it and boy was that obvious when they pulled up in it it had been really um um-hum pretty shabby shape huh it was in a mess it was just in a terrible mess uh um-hum um-hum so what's the last thing you ever had done to it well the last thing we did to it was today they had uh replaced the gear shift my goodness um it's uh it wasn't we had to order the part from the dealership and the guys put it in today when you shifted it down you didn't know if you were in park drive reverse whatever oh i hear you so that was the very last thing that we had to uh had to have done uh basically the whole car's been redone they put in new um um-hum they used new sheet metal and stuff to to repair the body i mean there were you know these rusted dents um-hum um-hum a new paint job they uh redid all of the trim we had the seats reupholstered we put in a new dash it's been recarpeted it's just it was you know just completely um-hum my goodness um-hum um-hum my gosh y'all put a lot of money in this yeah it was completely overhauled and uh for what um-hum is it a Diesel it's a diesel um-hum it sure is um-hum um-hum i guess it's what four speed on the column yeah you're right um-hum um-hum i seem to recall the old Mercedes had four speeds on the column yeah yeah and it's it's just been lovingly restored that's one good thing about about having somebody to do it your you're you're there because they worked on it here at our home um-hum um-hum um-hum so how many miles does it have on it i have no idea i i doubt that anybody will ever really know why is the speedometer was disconnected or something well i i i can't really remember what it shows on there but i remember when we discussed it we said that we were pretty sure that that was like times maybe or add an additional one hundred added on to that a hundred thousand um-hum um-hum um i hear you yeah because it's uh it had definitely been through the mill but uh um well i got a little car that uh has a certain history to it too uh-huh it's an old seventy one Maverick and i'm not trying to redo the body or anything oh yeah but i've had it to drive back and forth to work now for some i guess nineteen years or so um-hum um-hum oh my gosh you've had it and it's got two hundred and one thousand miles on it oh my word and it's an automatic transmission and it's just a regular old everyday go back and forth to work car uh-huh um-hum and uh i uh i guess the interesting history about this is about the only work i do on it myself an the last time i did do some work was i did a brake job on it and that cost me fourteen dollars um-hum oh my word by buying the parts at one of the local discount parts houses you know and uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and luckily this time didn't need to have drums turned or anything replaced yeah then i was able to do a brake job on there at fairly i think inexpensive price by doing it myself of course yeah oh definitely but another interesting aspect of this car like yours is uh it's only had the oil changed about six times since uh seventy five thousand miles oh gosh uh-huh uh-huh because i only change the oil every twenty five thousand miles right right i do change oil filters every twelve thousand five hundred though uh-huh uh-huh but uh other than that it only has the oil changed every twenty five thousand miles and that is a a true statement i just wrote Mobil Oil Corporation a letter as a matter of fact yeah two weeks ago thanking them for the uh good durability that Mobil One oil which is what i use in it provides uh-huh because it does have two hundred and one thousand honest miles gosh that's unbelievable and it's only had the oil changed those few times and uh it uh performs very nicely it's shifting the uh transmission of course i get overhauled on it not overhauled but hum uh-huh all the uh fluid drained out and new screen and and filters and everything put them in every fifty thousand miles religiously right right um-hum um-hum so it still shifts just a crisp today as it did when it was brand new that's amazing that is amazing and the engine still runs just as strong today as it did when it was brand new is it the same engine that's been in it all the time oh yeah the the engine's never had any work done on it all except at ninety five thousand miles i think it was uh we rebuilt the carburetor and a hundred thirty five thousand miles we put a new uh water pump on it no internal work has ever been done on the engine um-hum um-hum um-hum it's had uh three starters uh one fuel pump about six eight ten batteries i guess been put in the car and um uh one uh uh um voltage regulator during all this time wow uh-huh yeah yeah and that's it nothing else been ever done to it except you know the usual filters and this that and the other that you have to put on a that's amazing yeah and doing that it and the uh radiator on it has been rebuilt twice yeah so the car was how old when you when you bought it well i bought it from a fellow that i knew uh that worked up here it had sixty nine thousand miles on it at that time um-hum um-hum he always took good care of it and he bought it just to pull a boat with and when it when it got to be old and uh or older i bought it in seventy seven from him it was about six years old yeah oh i see um-hum um-hum uh-huh and uh it had sixty nine thousand miles on it and i had written about synthetic i had read about synthetic oil s in Popular Science so i decided hey this is a good car to experiment on it i don't have much money in it you know i only bought it for a thousand dollars yeah exactly yeah uh-huh uh-huh so i changed it over to uh Mobil One at seventy five thousand miles and i proceeded from then on to never change the oil but every twenty five thousand miles as they say on the can uh-huh and uh but i yeah oh is it does say that on the can but the oil gets yeah it says that on the can Mobil One cans if you read them says uh uh it it it says as as the automobile manufacturer recommends or twenty five thousand miles what they used to say anyway i didn't realize that uh-huh um-hum um-hum so i decided this would do as a good experiment and i had read about this these kinds of synthetic oils in um as i said Popular Science yeah um-hum right but the oil gets so black that uh at every twelve thousand five hundred miles i do pull the oil filter and change out the oil filter and when you do that you have to add a quart um-hum but this car uses no oil at all between oil changes i mean not a drop oh i see yeah that's amazing yeah and this is a Maverick you said it's a seventy one Maverick Maverick well i had uh i had owned a Cougar up until oh just several months ago that i had had since uh um i think it was an eighty two or something uh-huh and i had that car only uh about two years and the engine blew in it oh and so i had to put in a new engine that was that's an experience when you have a two year old car you know and it wasn't in warranty then i mean it must have like the day after the warranty was expired it must have exploded uh my goodness what kind of engine was it i have no idea uh V is it V eight i don't i don't know a lot of well they have V eights they have V sixes and they have what's the biggest one is a V eight bigger i guess the V eight yeah that's what it had in it well that's interesting and yeah so it it uh that's my latest experience with something major i guess that's uh uh you uh you must undoubtedly get all kinds of different uh uh engine types or whatever in terms of their durability depending on how they got made but this one here has just lasted and lasted and lasted yeah yeah well see that's what i was thinking i thought maybe it has something because that turned me off from American cars i mean you know something and and i'm sure i shouldn't i shouldn't feel that way that's why i was surprised to hear you talk about this car it sounds very resilient oh really um whatever they have in that engine whatever a kind of engine it is in that car it's just a V eight same as what was in your Cougar probably yeah yeah yeah maybe it has something to do but i i know i took good care of it i changed the oil quite often i didn't even do that myself i i could never do any of this myself you did yeah you know i'm just not uh i'm not uh and it still blew up you're sure nobody ever sugared your gas tank or anything that got mad at you about something yeah and it still blew up well now that yeah not that i know of because i had a van that uh somebody sugared my gas tank and it it tore that engine up and i had to replace it but if it hadn't been for that then uh oh really i would've never had any problems you would never have a problem well you know that's possible i never had thought about it but that's my i'm i have a all it takes is a cup full of sugar dumped down your gas tank and it will ruin the engine what what does that do it uh freezes up the rings and everything inside so they can't lubricate sugar does it turns to like a a syrupy like crud uh-huh oh okay just like just like sugar would it turns syrupy yeah and uh it it freezes everything up it scalds it scalds the bearings in an engine it essentially just freezes it up um-hum um-hum yeah and the only thing to do is take it apart and completely rebuild it from bottom out yeah and generally it ruins the engine to the point where you have to replace it yeah ugh well that maybe that's what happened to it because it had been it had been fine but the odd thing about it was is after i had that engine replaced that car ran hot every summer i mean even though yes Texas is notorious i mean we it's true we have a hundred and eight degree days but you know it uh i had i had trouble with that car after that i don't know if it was just a lemon um um um-hum um even though it was a brand new engine you know so uh that's amazing might not have been rebuilt properly or they might have put too high a degree thermostat in it yeah course it was a brand new engine supposedly now that's what the dealership told me you know yeah well even if it was if they put the wrong size thermostat in it for the climate you're in it could could make it run hotter yeah yeah that's what i i know my i had uh had my dad to finally took it down there because i would take it back and forth and the dealership would not it was i still had the problem it just continued and continued and they would charge me you know two hundred dollars every time they looked at it um-hum um-hum and um he kept saying the same thing he said it seems like it was your thermostat but at any rate it was really never rectified and i told the people that when i sold it to them i said you know you you might need to watch out but they didn't seem to mind um um-hum they wanted the car so hum you know as far as my ability to do anything on it i can check the oil i know that's about as far as it goes it's been amazing to watch these guys work on this car i mean you know just from um-hum how did y'all come to uh to uh make the seventy three your your collector's item you might say well it just this this gentleman had this car and uh you know he had he had told my fiance that he was going to sell it i mean he just i mean he sold it to us for like three hundred bucks you know and um and we took before we said we'd buy it we uh took it to a Mercedes dealership and they looked at the engine and uh the engine had been rebuilt about uh i think the guy had told us two hundred miles previously or something and um-hum they said it you know the engine alone was worth you know much more than that so we didn't feel like there was any problem um-hum and uh it's it's definitely been amazing to to see the transformation we took we took after pictures it's a shame that we didn't take before pictures because yeah it was just uh as i said rusted dents and the color was that dark dark green that's almost no you should've  women yeah the changing roles of women how roles changed and what do you see coming in the future oh okay that's not a broad enough topic okay yeah sounds good i'm ready when you are okay hold on okay are you there oh my goodness i can't believe i did that okay hold on yep i'm here uh that's okay okay um okay um i don't know are you in your thirties or do you no i i'm twenty three oh okay well then i can tell you that roles have changed i'm thirty eight and they've changed quite a bit um um-hum um-hum uh-huh um-hum i this was my twentieth high school reunion in Chicago and basically um uh-huh the choices i mean you know you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that that's kind of um the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies it was sort of just to um go protest and uh right uh-huh right just everybody be damned and live with someone and you know social social morals were a little bit lacking oh i know that uh um-hum i know that uh in in the early seventies uh i think women were the first people to to make a move as far as individuals um-hum um uh before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like uh Black people or you know just large large groups of people but but the right it was more it was more civil rights oriented or race oriented rather than gender based yeah right and i think i think the women's movement kind of brought in individual lives where you had women's movements and you had gay movements and just the smaller groups of people and i think since then is is when a lot of the women's roles were started to change um-hum it did it did and some of the other stuff that um i think that changed it you uh when i first got out of college fifteen years ago they were always saying well if you if you were assertive you were a libber or you were aggressive not assertive and independent and um-hum in terms of the corporate community i've seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote unquote used to women who are in uh controlling positions as higher you know corporate in the corporate hierarchy so i think that's good um-hum exactly um-hum i think that uh you know you can just look at home life and see i've been talking a lot of people about education and things and and what what what affects the school system and i think that a big thing that affects it is that the mother is not home anymore um-hum right um like she used to be she used to be kind of kind of a a rock you know in the house yeah and uh since since everyone the mainstay yeah going out and working now whether it be because of finances or just the economy uh the mother's not there anymore and the children are i think i think a lot of society is suffering not to say that women shouldn't and restructuring stuff families yeah you know go out and do what they want to do but i think that um society's going to really have to get used to it and they're not quite used to it yet and that's i right the schools or the moms the schools or the parents yeah yes uh-huh um i'm trying to think of what else i have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden i went blank a lot of the things um the demographics too i mean there's more i don't have the numbers in my head right now but a lot of the things that brought feminism i mean there are just more women in in in the demographics just generally in the United States in terms of being um-hum right um-hum i mean i'm the typical baby boomer i hate that term but in terms of women women going out i mean twenty three i remember that uh-huh yeah what's it like to be twenty three as a woman today i mean when i was twenty three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married um those were the general issues speaking of getting married i was talking to someone yesterday on this on the project and uh uh we were talking about child care and he asked me if i had any kids he was about forty or fifty years old and i said no i'm just twenty and i said no i'm just twenty three uh-huh he was ancient yeah uh-huh you know because i don't think of myself as needing to have children but the the first thing he says is well don't you miss that part of your life and i just i my my mind just went i went what you know because it didn't it really didn't doesn't even occur to me right now to have children because you didn't know what was there to be missing i don't have any either and i've been a married for eleven years so huh yeah and it it just you know i think that i'll probably have children when i'm about thirty thirty five something like just because i'm not sure if it's just if it's just me or or women in general that are twenty three right now because um yeah when it's time um-hum i'm really into my career i'm trying to go somewhere yeah you want to establish and and get there quick and then worry about you know because right now in my career i'm i'm really starting out and it's going to take me a while to move up and i don't need anything kind of holding me back um um-hum right and and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of um women don't feel like they need to get married anymore i was twenty seven when i got married and i just at the time um my husband actually even jokes about it um-hum right uh-huh um-hum he was twenty three when we met and i was at a point where it was like i didn't date i mean i just i went out to have a good time but i didn't have to have male companionship um and a lot of the um right right right friends that i had in school at that point who had gone back and gone to law school or MBA programs um which i also had done had just you know they were very sad but then by the time i got married um it seemed like they were on their second or third around the marriage track um-hum um-hum yeah yeah so i guess that's a big change in terms of just um the attachments that women feel like they need to have the dependency their self-identity is stronger yeah yeah yeah it's it's just really not there anymore and that that has to do with you know the women getting out and other women seeing women seeing other women you know out in the corporate world that's like oh i can do that you know maybe i don't need to get married right um-hum right and i i i mean i don't know how how old your mom is she's probably let's see my mother's in her early sixties so she's about forty um-hum okay i'm thirty eight your mother's forty i just turned thirty eight um yes i'm laughing oh my God it does start to creep up no um but it's okay don't ever let age i mean i don't think um-hum okay nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men i i just turned twenty three uh April twentieth and i'm still going you know oh my God i'm getting so old i just because me myself i just like to move really really quickly uh-huh yeah and i like to anything i do i got out of school quick i'm you know i'm working quick i want to move up quick i want to make money quick i want to retire quick and so anything um-hum yeah when when the age creeps up where i'm twenty three and twenty four i'm thinking my time is running out you know but i'm actually very very young yeah you are because what i was going to say is what you'll find is my background is in journalism and corporate communications and what you'll find is i mean i'm just now um-hum finally to a point where i mean i don't know why i didn't didn't do it sooner but this is probably typical of the women's movement too the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway if you want to go back to school i'm seriously considering going back to school for law um um which is a complete i wouldn't say career change it's it's a but it's still is a different application and i mean if you think about it um-hum you know i can i still can have another career i mean i've worked for over fifteen years in what i've done and i mean so when you're saying quick um i think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine is thinking that um yeah yeah they have to do everything you know sort of i call kind of i call it a chewing syndrome they have to eat real fast they have they have to rapidity of speech they have to just go through everything right uh-huh exactly exactly and you'll find that probably by the time you're twenty eight thirty if you haven't slowed down something will slow you down do you know what i'm saying um because it's just you find out that you're really not um smelling the roses and i know that sounds trite and all that um-hum yeah yeah yeah i think i think a lot of uh people probably feeling that way i know i'm probably feeling that way because it's everything's geared towards young um-hum you know and whether i want to realize it or not everything on television is young young young young you can't be a model after thirty you can't do this after twenty you know and every everybody that's in the music business is starting out at fifteen oh it is that's right um-hum you know and so i feel like i'm old it's like i sing i sing and i would really love to become um-hum uh a professional singer but i think i'm too old now and i'm twenty three because everyone i've seen coming up they're fifteen oh you're not no no it's true i mean it's it's you know and so i'm going i'm so old and i'm i i really have to always tell myself no you're not you're very young and you know so it's no you're extremely yeah it's it's just well it's like us we're getting ready to do if possible for an adoption and i have friends that say well why would you do that if you know you haven't been able to children which we do know why would you do that now at this part point and um um-hum um-hum it's just individual choices i stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had um in my family my brother's children i mean he just turned forty his children will be out of high school before he's forty five um yeah um-hum wow um i mean that's like your mother look how young she is compared to where you are out of school and everything it's just it but what you find is you don't compare the woman because you just get into trouble it's all independent and choices um-hum yeah right um-hum yeah very true um but what i was going to say about mothers is uh your mother probably just won't say it but i mean my mother and her sisters are always saying uh to my cousins and i my female cousins you girls are so lucky because quote unquote you have all these choices you know you went to school you can do this you can do that we couldn't do that then and my cousins and i go well why couldn't you and they right um-hum yeah that's that's why i say i feel i feel really lucky right now because because i'm not married and because i don't have children i'm out of school i'm twenty three i can do anything i want to do anything and so i mean even some days i'm looking for another job now but and i get so depressed because not because i can't find a job but because i can't figure out what i want to do um-hum and that's normal i mean i think that's the world today and yeah and i feel and i'm lucky though because not a lot of people can sit there and go gee i don't know what to do i have so much you know not a lot of people but it's depressing too what do you what do you do that you're uh-huh right that's exactly yeah that's how i mean what i'm right now i'm i'm a freelance writer right now and then um what i'm doing is oh working at um a electronics an electronics company for their company newspaper right now on the side and then i'm also actually i'm excited tomorrow i have a um hum oh luncheon appointment with a prospective client to do um marketing communications for them hum hum okay i'm a i'm a news reporter now and what i'm looking for is something in i really don't want to stay in news but i would like to stay in journalism and i've been looking for something exactly like that just um-hum so we oh you are what here's what you should do this is off the topic and these people probably won't did you go to Baylor by any chance okay no i don't i went to UT at Austin and i i just happen to work at a Waco station because you know oh okay that's even better i went to are you in radio or television or news broadcast broadcast news uh-huh TV uh my journalism degree is in  well what books do you like um a broad spectrum my tastes seem to change over the years um i like uh uh mysteries adventure some science fiction i like uh Sagan i read i read just about everything that he puts out uh-huh um Robert Ludlum great and i've just started uh i got a whole set of books on uh Sherlock Holmes uh-huh so i'm just getting into that uh that's kind of uh interesting it's unique yeah how about yourself yeah those are great uh i've been a Sherlock Holmes fan for years and i think i've read most of his stuff multiple numbers of times oh you have uh i just find it very relaxing and very enjoyable and i always hope for my memory to to fail me so after a couple of years i can pick up a story and read it again uh oh okay uh i got a whole set i got a set for Christmas that's great so i've just started into some in to him i haven't uh i've uh i think uh they had uh uh Sherlock Holmes uh miniseries on uh on educational TV uh-huh uh channel two up here i'm not sure what it is down there and they had uh uh some of his i i started watching that and i got interested in it so that's why i got the gift yeah yeah so you've been doing it for a long time yeah i started reading them years and years ago and i it's and i i'm not really much of a mystery reader although i've always liked Sherlock Holmes and then somebody turned me on to a guy named Dick Frances um and he's uh a former jockey and he writes mystery stories and they always involve horse racing in one form or another he's very very good if uh you've never read him that would be a great opportunity no i mean is Dick Frances his name is Dick Frances and any book store owner will know who Dick Frances is um yeah and you can pick up any of his stuff and you can just sort of try it and if you like his style well he's written i'd say twenty or twenty five oh okay yeah um novels you know he's quite quite clever my taste runs runs to uh Ludlum you know that type of uh the adventure stuff yeah adventure yeah uh some of that gets i don't know i think they've got ghost writers now on a lot of them and uh they just put their name to it because years ago either that or my tastes are changing um yeah they just don't have the same depth that they seem to have before huh yeah you know i always suspected uh uh uh Michener of doing that you know i read some of his early stuff and then it seemed like his later stuff they would be these long long long passages that were just of inferior quality it it was yeah it was uh just to fill a page yeah i mean i just got the feeling that he sort of has a coterie of of students and he says okay go write three chapters on this and he and he kind of he might write some stuff i don't think he writes all his stuff every word i may be wrong yeah you're probably right um uh i'm trying to think of that uh Stephen King yeah have you read any of his i've read a couple of his things i i just wasn't that crazy about him which really puts me in the i know in the vast minority no no no no i've i've read a couple of them that weren't too bad um my oldest boy is into him so he's oh you've got to read this dad you've got to read that dad but i'm not that's not really not my uh cup of tea yeah except the the latest one he's got out uh it's uh fourteen hundred or fifteen hundred page he had he had published it about ten years ago huh and he's got it out now with the with the the full text no cuts and no he he explains that when he did it the first time because of publishing costs they asked they asked him to cut it back a third yeah so that's what he did now he's got it out and i can't even think of the name of it but it's starting out pretty good um it's something that's not huh like his present style yeah yeah um but other than that um i've read Dune i don't know if you've read Dune i read Dune years ago and i again you you i uh i just did not care for Dune i read through it all it was laborious i i uh felt i had to get through it and when i put it down i never wanted to read another thing by that guy again to read it again yeah i've read uh i like the original Dune and then they had he's had two others after that which i didn't care for at all so i kind of fell off yeah yeah yeah um but again i realize i mean i all my friends were saying how great Dune was and i just could not could not get into it i read the whole thing but i didn't enjoy didn't enjoy it that much have you read any science fiction at all i really read a lot of science fiction and Asimov is one of my favorite authors yeah i think his stuff is is great just going back to his very early works and almost anything he writes i try to read uh even i haven't read any of his recent but i've read some of his old uh uh things and in yeah i i like him he's he's not too bad some of it's uh not him but some of the other science fiction i mean it's just so uh uh like uh Tolkien yeah i never could get into him interesting and i was just crazy about Tolkien i read his stuff and i reread it and i read the whole twelve hundred pages aloud to my son when he was uh a young boy when he was about eight or nine we would just read ten pages every night and i just did that you know for a half a year until i'd read the whole thing out loud huh that's interesting and uh yeah my um both my boys are into him but i don't know it's just something i i don't know if i had the time or put myself in the frame of mind for it yeah yeah what do you do what do you do for um educational anything well uh uh being a college professor there's just a certain amount of academic reading i do as a matter of course oh so you have to you're forced into it no matter what well well well yeah forced is probably not too strong a word but yeah yeah to keep up in your field you usually have to do some uh some technical reading but uh i actually like um for technical reading i like to read what i call uh soft core science like uh Discovery Magazine that's i get that which i like very much and uh and then uh National Science Foundation puts out an excellent publication called Mosaic with uh the and they get some of the best scholars scholars and scientists in the country to write articles that can be understood they're not highly technical but they're not probably not as simplified as in Discovery huh but they're very good except i couldn't i just got on their list somehow because at one time i did some research for them and i'm not really sure how one would go about getting this but it's it's excellent uh for finding out what's going on in fields other than your own yeah have have you ever heard of the Source Book Project i don't believe so Source Book Project uh it deals with anomalies um whether it's uh animal vegetable or mineral or or geologic anomalies oh no no you know like uh uh rain fish you know that type of thing oh that would be fascinating or the uh the uh is it the Mima mounds in um Kentucky i think or Tennessee i don't know what what about them well it's just the Source Book Project um it gives you a short uh synopsis of of whatever they're talking about and then it gives you all the sources that you can look up uh-huh if you're interested in it i see okay that would be a very interesting thing and they they tried to uh uh throw out the uh sensationalism you know like flying saucers and all that kind of stuff right the things that they that they publish are documented sightings you know and an or digs or whatever uh-huh um i'm kind of in to that i'm uh uh i belong to the Narragansett Archeology Society so i like going back and you know digging up things it gives me you know uh it's kind of a a thrill to see something that nobody's looked at for two or three thousand years yeah do you have any interest in Stonehenge or did you ever have any uh as far as being uh yes that type of thing yeah that's what these Mima mounds were supposedly like early Stonehenge in America um yeah i'm fascinated with that kind of stuff in fact just recently uh a few days ago they discovered a cave  uh what have you had any home repairs done lately on your home well that's that's something um yeah we have it's a very timely subject i think in the Spring everybody decides that they're going to start over and do something with their house and we started last year an we have a little i guess it's a sixteen hundred foot house and it's just my husband and i here but um we decided that uh we wanted to build a sun room and um it's a good thing we got a contractor i mean this is not something you need to do by yourself so we ended up with a contractor and went through that whole schmeal with um the contractor saying one thing and then doing another and and uh anyway we ended up with uh a really neat sun room on the back of the house it's beautiful it's like two hundred square foot but that's not um something we did by ourselves if you talk about home repairs um Tom's real good at mowing the grass and doing the garden so that's about it yeah we uh of course we have a new house that we've uh that we bought about a year ago and it's been a chore just getting the uh builder to come back and finish everything up the way it's supposed to isn't that amazing uh yeah it's been an experience it's one i don't want to repeat anytime soon but we've had some we haven't had anything really major uh wrong other than uh we did have like a water leak in the wall in the in the garage and yeah and uh the water heater upstairs in the attic it uh had a little leak and leaked down in uh under the ceiling and they had to come in and do some tape and bedding and repaint you know treat the ceiling but nothing nothing major those those kind of things really weren't major uh just some of those kind of things that can happen yeah but uh just getting him out there to finish up and that sort of thing was has been a real effort all those little details that you you don't really understand you know like we had some water leaks in the um well in the sun room there was a part that was fiberboard and you know tape and bed over that and when it did rain of course the only way to tell if this place leaks is to see if uh what happens after it rains uh-huh and of course it leaked um which is no big deal because they said they'd come fix it well that's true but you know fixing the tape and bedding to make it look nice again it's it's it's hard it's hard to make it fit perfectly it's a chore and a half without tearing the whole thing out and repainting and doing everything again well fortunately ours was on the ceiling where they had the blow in ceiling the little uh oh the little the little you know uh styrofoam balls that they paint over so it was easy to disguise that but uh it was in an area where you don't really look at very much so we were lucky in that respect yeah i don't know i i guess you get this idea that everything should be perfect and you know what this isn't a perfect world no however i do think that a lot of times contractors try to get out of doing things that they say they're going to do and uh it but you do oh i know because every time they send somebody out they have to take them off a crew that's making money doing a job and they have to send them back to you where they're not making any money trying to repair something that you know should have been right in the first place yeah and and then they don't do a real good job doing it too they just kind of get get it done as quickly as possible yeah well i was real happy with our contractor um actually i wasn't happy with the contractor i was happy with the job foreman so i think that made all the difference because he was pretty um you know concerned about how it looked and and you know how it should be done the right way and he gave us a lot of clues you just wish you knew all this stuff going in that um it was funny because we didn't understand a lot of things that we had to do in addition to this you know like the tape and bedding and and doing finishing off this wall and that wall that wasn't in the contract you know kind of thing so that was kind of interesting yeah they i i like when they come in of course i designed my own house i'm i i've had prior experience in design and building and stuff like that so i know basically if it's done right the problem is i don't want to do anymore oh neat oh yeah i want someone to do it for me and uh just trying to get them to do what they say they're going to do is a real effort yeah well we've taken this another step further this year we're going to build a deck we've got some people building uh a deck out in the back you know to complete sort of the back yard kind of thing and um well i could recommend something there if if you know if if it's not just cost prohibitive oh yeah for you uh i've built probably three decks on three different houses oh and the first time i went with regular just treated pine kind of a womanized pine and then i i treated spray treated it with some um uh-huh um panta oil which you have to do about every two years okay the problem with that is it warps after a couple of years then and you have to start replacing boards i was wondering about that yeah the second time i did it out of cedar which i soaked in Thompson Water Seal uh-huh and that works fine but there again it it discolors real bad you soaked it oh yeah you know the sun and everything else it just makes it look gray and dull an and it doesn't look attractive after a a few years the wood lasts fine but the color i was real dissatisfied the color is what you're yeah sometimes after and if you can stand the additional expense which you you'll recoup after a while because it will last forever is the redwood if you'll go with the redwood that's that's what we're doing is just the redwood and we're doing it where they use the screws that are um they're not nails they're the screws have they're screws the self adhesive screws all right yeah those and so they're not going to split and and i was really concerned about bugs really when i when we were considering other types of wood because you know termites can be a real hazard around here you have to pretty much spray them regularly you know under an and around or whatever so you want to leave yourself uh enough space to get under it or or be able to lift it up yeah on some ends a lot of times they won't even detach them to the ground they just lay them up on some cinder blocks underneath in the ground um-hum and they're heavy enough where they won't the wind won't pick them up or they won't shift if it's big enough and heavy enough so they're several ways of doing it but the redwood is by by far the best and i would and i would also insist on that they do treat that with Thompson's Water Seal that yeah that's that's the end part that's where you you know get the uh that's the part we have to do we got that up front we figured it out you know we need to know what we need to do um that's not included in this and that's one of the uh details but that's fine as long as they tell you yeah yeah it's so funny because Tom is getting more and more adept at doing things it's just things like painting just always used to really scare me he didn't know where to start um you know with a paint can you know an well it is it's it's a frightening experience the one thing you might do if he will deliver the boards that he is going to make the under structure with it sure is um-hum before he starts doing the construction to go ahead and do the water seal oh and do the water seal floor on those and then when he cuts them and puts them together then that'll already be treated and a fast way of doing that if you'll go get a piece of guttering material like a little trough uh-huh and cover cover both ends or some sort of something that that will fit in okay and i got you covered there pour that in pour the water Thompson's Water Seal in there and then just put that in there and turn them over several times and let them set and soak in kind of like marinate them yeah that's right that that works wonders it i know it takes a lot of extra time but it's it's by far worth it and that's just a water sealing and what happens if they aren't water sealed well over a period of time any any lumber will deteriorate yeah will deteriorate yeah now redwood would take quite a few years it depends on how many years you you plan to stay there yeah but uh redwood even if you don't treat it properly will begin to discolor and will begin to degrade even though it will be strong structurally strong and and will be there for a lot longer yeah they did tell us that we'd have to you know every couple of years just you know do brush up on the color um actually if you do the the water seal correctly um-hum you don't even have to do that oh really i've seen decks that are ten years old that uh that still have never had the had the uh the water proof stain put back over it or whatever huh and uh or they even have some rejuvenator that you can put on there that makes the redwood color come back but it's expensive and and and most cases if you do it properly it will not even be required well that's a really interesting tip and uh definitely something Tom could handle doing that yeah and and the Thompson's is is good because you can roll it on with a roller you can spray it on you can yeah he suggested just getting uh um a uh um a mop like you would use or or a mop anything you can put that on with anything whereas a lot of this other stuff you have to you have to actually sit down and paint it with a brush a mop just paint it yeah uh and or spray it but then you've got to worry about the over spray whereas this stuff is clear uh-huh even if you got it on the side of some of your bricks or or on your concrete it wouldn't hurt anything you couldn't tell oh you would never be able to know it so well that's definitely interesting so here we go with another home project well it it's kind of fun though things like that especially something like that where where you're outside you're not worrying about something inside the house that you can mess up outside you can learn a lot by doing that it is i like well like i said Tom does great with his garden i i always uh enjoyed working on the crew in the plays and building stuff so i'm i'm really in infatuated with building things and well and it's and it could be cheaper in the long run and and making things you know but there's nothing like getting a perfect  okay um where are you from Connie i'm from Dennison from Dennison well we live in Plano Plano great what are they doing anything down there for recycling yes as a matter of fact they really are in uh February i think it was the city started the first phase of a three part first two phases of a three part phase in for uh uh city wide you know collection type thing uh-huh and the way they're doing this is they said no more trash bags is that how you set out your trash yeah yeah that's the way we always had too no more trash bags and they assigned everybody well i think it's ninety five gallons big bucket well that's neat and uh and you can put everything you know they all look the same they're great big green things they run on rollers they're not hard at all even my you know eight and ten year old can do it take them out to the street we used to have twice a week collection and now they have once a week collection for that uh-huh and you don't have to use the garbage bags anymore you just uh do you separate your trash not yet but well i think they should do that that's the third part the second part is we now have a uh paper type biodegradable real big bag for all the lawn clippings and anything and they've always been encouraging us to not bag our uh-huh i thought about that last last this last couple weeks ago when we bagged up our leaves it was sixteen or eighteen bags of leaves uh-huh uh-huh oh gosh and yeah and it takes forever for that plastic to dissolve well we have a garden and so we have always you know we'll rake the leaves and then we mow them so they're little chibbles you know uh-huh and you use it as mulch uh-huh and use them as mulch in the garden or around the yard so you know we've done that for along time and we try not to bag our grass clippings unless its just so long we have to but then we put it back on the garden so i've never worried about that but um they are doing that now where you cannot put out grass stuff you see when you put out your regular trash ah they won't let you good huh-uh now the third part is and it was supposed to have started in May but something and i don't remember the exact reason from Persian Gulf um trickle down fouled that up and so now we're not going to do that until end of June but then they will give us another container that where we will put everything recyclable glass plastic right paper uh paper can go now we bundle that on top of our and set it out beside our green okay thing full a newspaper but but the other kinds of paper will go and like i say did i say glass glass plastic other papers tin aluminum and there's something else oh i can't think of anything milk cartons and soda bottles yeah like that too that all comes under plastic and glass i can't think what the other thing is anyway we won't even have to sort it at least that's what they say but the guy will come by and sort it there at the curb well that's good that's neat oh that's going to be a lot of hard work though well for them yes but it will be more profitable in the long run from what i understand because well i know everybody's throwing away millions of dollars worth of plastic and stuff everyday just to be buried they have already they sell all this stuff and see we have recycling centers here in the town that are setup by the city and that are you know emptied but you know like it will say on there uh green glass only or aluminum only uh-huh and then somebody comes along and mixes it up doesn't do it right its better for them to hire somebody and pay somebody to do it right because if you even put in just say you had this huge container of white glass and three or four brown or green glass bottles got in there and got shattered there's no way you can pick all that out yeah uh-huh you see what i'm saying so it you know its useless yes that well it's not useless it just can't be sold as clear glass anymore back to the recycle places they say well uh you know look you already you've got and they have percentages you know they're not doing much down here though yeah uh-huh that what they will accept the only they think i've heard of them doing down here in Dennison is Wal-Mart let's you put there you know uh milk cartons and uh-huh two liter bottles those clear plastic bottles that's about it uh-huh well all of our um grocery stores are going to um they have each of one i shop at i go to a Skaggs and Albertson's and a Kroger and they will let you bring in uh-huh your own little paper bags or plastic bags they'll let you recycle them or you can bring them in and actually use them again little carry-on bags okay well they're doing that but every time i get paper bags at a grocery store i bring home bugs do you um i yeah and i can't do it don't know that i've ever had that problem i just try to reuse mine a lot at home too and okay but used to you know if i had a torn sack when i got home i just trashed it you know and anymore i don't do that i'll put it in with the paper recycling you know the newspaper or something uh-huh yeah well they ought to do that around down here um that always seems to help the uh um a lot of times if i know i'm just even if i know i've got a big family so you know i rarely come home with you know just a sack or two uh-huh but i have two canvas sacks that are big that are especially for taking to the grocery store that kind of thing and i'll always take those and use them and um uh-huh right i've seen those real environmentally conscious aren't you yeah yeah i always have been i always have been and uh i kind of got out of the habit of it you know for a few years when my children were small well when they did you use diapers what disposable diapers i didn't with my first three but i did with my last two goodness you've got five kids and yeah i have five and uh well the actually now i think about it i think it was number three that i used them a lot with and then number four came along and i used them some with him most of the time i think i used them with number four well i've got a three month old i used disposables on her for about a month and a half just to keep her from breaking out so bad uh-huh and then she had reaction to the oh she had reactions to cloth diapers it was from staying wet more often uh-huh yeah yeah oh they've just improved the and yeah well she's doing better they have are they biodegradable or more biodegradable i heard they're the worst things disposables so much oh yeah they really fill up because they stay forever but they work so good i mean that's one thing that we moms just think oh gosh yeah they do i don't mind using cloth diapers i really don't it's not all that much more work i uh pardon it's not all that much more work for disposable i mean for cloth well i always had you know several in diapers at the same time so that may have been you know why they looked so nice to me but yeah well cloth i mean disposables do look better they look they're not quite as bulky uh-huh she looks like a little mushroom but i used disposables with my first little boy well you know that well i think its just you know that you i think have to have in your mind an attitude of trading off you just say to yourself well this is not worth it to me to do such and so uh-huh but i want to make up for it because i want to be real conscientious in this and that you know what i'm saying you right well i'm you know all of us can to something and you know what works for one family may not work for another family and well i know to with disposable diapers though if you use cloth diapers your polluting with more soap and using more water and all that yeah that's true and you're using more electricity you're using it uh right more where as when you buy the others they used it more at the factory so you know you wonder you know you're not using it but somebody used it to create that item you know yeah you're right yeah you're right i didn't even think about that so but you know you know then you you figured on down the line it did give people jobs i use cloth diapers for a lot of stuff just besides you know if my kids have got a cold you know i put them in bed with cloth diapers you know with a cloth diaper to use instead of a hanky or or tissue you you know they can could just flat go through three dollars worth of tissue you in a morning you know oh yeah she's just right and uh-huh and they are the best dusters i know it and they make wonderful dusters oh well no question about it well i just you know i'm really glad to see us a world coming back to this and yeah it's really coming to a head it's been building up for a few years i remember this going on when i was a teenager sure sure for about the last ten years how long have you been married five years uh-huh uh-huh and i've got two children uh-huh so you know when you say you're a teenager you know i uh i've been married seventeen years and have always been you know like i say always been conscious this way but um i haven't not until this year it's really starting to so it's all brand new to you then to think of these things right yeah well they've really started you know i wish they would do that um with uh the buckets here instead of the trash bags here the city sends us trash bags uh-huh yeah that's what we had the program before too well there's a lot of information if you ever get to Dallas uh-huh you come in very often no i don't well if you ever get to come here you must put on your list of place to go is a place called  okay Amy uh what do you think about taking care of the elderly well i certainly um can appreciate the patience and the you know energy and money and time and effort it require would require for someone to you know take care of their elderly parent or whatever in their home uh-huh uh i think that you know would definitely be preferable if the person is you know able able to do that i think sometimes people take on i know i have one friend who is taken on more than she can handle you know with her her mom just needing constant supervision and for one person to be able to cope with that you know is really difficult but i know it's hard not to feel guilty you know to put somebody in a nursing home i if i suppose if you could find a nursing home that you thought really comfortable you know that they were getting adequate care but i think that's probably pretty hard to do at times uh-huh uh-huh i've not ever been put put in this position i personally would have a real hard time taking care of my father he's getting up there but he's very difficult to live with and i think that would be a real consideration in in um entering him into our family unit here you know yeah so there's a lot of factors involved what is the point at which you would go from home care to institutional care well i think i would in some ways have to decide how much personally you know i was able and willing to handle and how much it would affect you know the rest of my family because i have two small children uh-huh and um we don't have a real large house if you had a lot of money and you were able to you know have like a little separate wing or something where i wouldn't have to constantly be having my children you know be quiet and go away and that kind of thing to accommodate an elderly person uh-huh i think you know just the medical aspects too would be a big question how much um it would require you know in terms of nursing care at home and i know that there is uh often times insurance companies won't even pay you know and if they took families for doing things if if they were in a nursing home would cost you know a hundred times more so that's uh-huh that's a consideration too but i don't know it it would be a really rough choice to make you depending on the parent their personality and your own family and what's going on with i'm home all day anyway with the young kids but if i was working you know full time and had to give up a career that would be another you know problem too but uh-huh um the only people i've seen is my husband's grandmother has been in a nursing home for several years i know that uh there's been a lot of questions from other family members as to whether she's getting enough attention and whether they just kind of let her sit there and roll her over once in a while it it's really tragic to go in those places yeah what would you what would you look for in an institution so i don't know um i think i would uh look for a place that definitely had the physical attributes and it wasn't a sterile kind of environment but had a comfortable feeling to it that respected uh uh-huh that you seem to see some respect for peoples privacy and the attitude that the staff would have towards the patients and i was visiting a friend in the hospital and there was a nurse screaming at an older man who was there was a head injury unit and he had apparently wet his pants and they had a blanket draped over him and the blanket had either fallen to the floor or he had dropped it on the floor and the nurse was just screaming at him about how obscene that was or something and i just thought gosh if i walked into a place and i saw a staff member just berating or humiliating humiliating a patient i would definitely that would be something i'd really want to be on the look out for um yeah i would hope they would have uh some you consistent staff i know they don't pay that much in a lot of those places and so there's probably a lot of turnover that would be another thing that would be you know something to be important because i think it's confusing particularly if people are in some state of you know mental confusion anyway to have constant new people on staff and having to develop new relationships and uh-huh oh i don't know what else other than that maybe some place had activities you know that they could participate in instead of just kind of sitting there watching the wall or something you know talking to other people who had family members there see how responsive the staff was to right the things i brought up you know that i thought were important for my family member it it would really be hard because when we go to visit i'm sure places have you know their best foot forward kind of thing unless you drop in frequently and kind of get the since of what's going on behind the scenes it would really be hard to know it's kind of similar in away to some of the things you look for in going to try and find day care for your kids yeah uh-huh you know so uh i'm sure that if you have enough money you can find just super care but you know the cost of this probably just horrendous right would you consider a transitional institution such as one that allows the resident sort of like an apartment complex for elderly people yeah i think that would be great i i had wished often um with my husband's grandmother that she had been in a place like that because she had lived alone in an upper story of an apartment building away from even friends not really close by her or a grocery store or anything and i thought she could have lived a a lot longer if she had been in a place where she didn't have to climb up and down the stairs haul groceries and then she would have people to check on her and didn't have to cook because she just got to a point where she wouldn't cook just for herself and then she fell down and nobody knew about it for hours and hours and hours and uh-huh so i think that would be great if if you know if i had to choose a place for myself that's definitely why i think that kind of atmosphere would be wonderful even i recall where i was living in the college dormitory as a graduate student i thought how how neat you know that you can have a place where you can you know go down together and have dinner with other people because if your living alone the isolation and the depression and all those other factors should be taken into consideration too so i thought you know they should have dorms for older people they had activities going on all the time and you know it was really a much more comfortable lifestyle i could imagine for an older person so yeah i think that would be great if they had places like that yeah yeah that's uh you know i hope if my my mother ever gets to the point where she can't take care of the home herself that she would consider uh the apartment type um-hum yeah setting you know from what i've seen with my grandmother grandmother who passed i don't know maybe ten or twelve years ago they had her in a setting like that where she was responsible to go to they had dinner in the cafeteria and she had her own little room it wasn't like she didn't have a stove or anything in her own apartment yeah they had their own privacy yeah yeah but you know she could walk to walk to the dinner hall and had games and stuff so it was sort of like a step between a um-hum nursing home and a uh you know just a retirement village or whatever they're called those so i guess there's different levels you just have to be sure and match your loved one with that right yeah yeah i don't know you know how many of those there are but i definitely think it's a great idea to have that kind of thing you know for people i know that um in that way too that sometimes the elderly can be more involved with their families they can have their grandkids and that kind of thing over to spend the night or there's a lot more freedom i think uh-huh instead of just being kind of taken away from all of that and told where you're going to be and what you're going to do in a nursing home yeah it's she'll become uh so you know a bigger issue as you know the medical profession continues to you know increase longevity yeah yeah we're going to see you know geriatrics will be a a big part of the medical profession i think yeah yeah so let's hope it's true it's a lot to consider it is i've i've had had a lot of uh thought thought provoking conversations on the topics yeah yeah yeah i i guess i'm a big advocate of um decreased morbidity which is where the elderly person through i don't know a healthier lifestyle and exercise and eating right can um-hum uh you know sustain them for longer periods of time right right well as the insurance companies get more into this preventative health care i think that will help it just seems very slow that that happening but uh yeah i definitely think that will help right yeah hopefully uh yeah the insurance companies will see the advantage of signing up a sixty year old for a uh you know exercise class or yeah yeah well uh it's been fun talking with you okay well take care thank you bye-bye all right bye  okay all right uh do you have any friends who have children i do have friends that have children yes and what do they say about finding adequate child care i think that may be the key word they i think that's correct there i relatively not existent from uh from what i hear from my friends it seems like uh even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable that are sort of like a chain if i can use that word uh still you have to deal with the people that you know happen to be operating it locally right and uh it's just a matter of of trust you know i think they feel that these people are um under qualified basically and underpaid and i think that sort of goes hand in hand so it's it's difficult for them well we've certainly found that to be true uh indeed we've um-hum our children are now eleven and nine and we moved away from institutionalized child care if we can call those chain kind of things like that uh by that name uh-huh um-hum right right and found that uh more creative avenues were the right answer for us uh at one point in time we've had au pairs um-hum um-hum um-hum by trading services with them um-hum um-hum then that worked for a while but they were really adequate ones were really tough to find it takes that i'm sure that's true um-hum um-hum that uh mixture of a very mature college student who wants to do something and yet is willing to give the time right and the interest to the children right i do have a friend that uh uh she and her roommate became live in uh care givers and they they loved it they had stayed with this family from the time these children were small you know four or five years old up until they were well into grade school and uh she was paid very well because they the parents trusted them and they you know had done such a good job so um i can see where someone you know in a position like that in a live in capacity would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the finances to be able to do that well that's true and that's something that we're struggling with now as yeah yeah i think it's just a matter of priorities it's uh you know a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way but you still have to be realistic as well i think oh yeah yeah yeah you know any you much as uh other cultures might disagree our lives don't revolve around our children um-hum yeah yeah and that's that's that's sad to have to admit too but uh you know it's just there's so much pressure when you're talking about uh two people that work outside the home and and i think that's one reason why i continue to be without children i it's just such a such a responsibility and and when i've had friends that have said when you hear people say it alters your life forever please take heed and realize that that's true so it's uh such a responsibility well it certainly is uh if i can gather the other side of the coin for a moment it is such an honor and a thrill um-hum oh yeah to be a parent um-hum um-hum that most of the time it's worth it yeah most of the time you know i i just have to be honest about it it's not always worth it yeah oh sure sure there are those times when i think jeez if i didn't have children i could be out playing bridge or golf sure right right right right but you know it's it's funny i did i i had a friend that said you know before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other and she got older she said but you know we never do those things anyway so why why am i waiting you know it's just the it's just the way your attitude changes and you mature i suppose but the thing about the child care i you know i have friends that struggle financially and and they both do have to work it's a matter of not necessarily uh that she might want to stay home or he as well but you know that they need the money and uh when i seen some of my my friends that have taken that six week old baby you know to someone else and it's just i can imagine how emotional it must be and and you know multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation you've been placed in as far as child care goes um it's it's just a scary thing well we were lucky when our children were that age and living having lived in a community for a while and we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children and um-hum um um that's a big plus yes and and felt that that bond of safety and feeling of safety right right and leaving them with them as small children um-hum um-hum but we also learned something from that experience as our children got older in that yeah uh care givers are not omniscious omniscipotent they're they are not all things to all people or all children uh-huh right right right the the ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers yeah um-hum um-hum i think it takes a lot i i don't know i think your patient level must needs to increase as the child gets older i think that might be part of the problem with some people you know taking care of a baby i know is not an easy thing but when you have them in their their little feet are moving and you have to chase them down constantly i'm sure that's a whole new ball game oh yeah i got a nine year old i'd trade happily for a babe in arms today oh really well you sound like your pretty well maybe passed the worst of it as far as worrying about since they're both in school you don't have to worry about a full-time person to take care of them oh you don't know what happens after they get in school is that that's something all together different huh oh yes now we have uh one takes piano lessons at at somewhere on one afternoon and the other one of course can't do the same thing um-hum oh of course not and it has to be somewhere else and no it's not adequate to sit and wait uh-huh you can't do that no no no no no that's just that will not do no no no no that's out of the question i'm sure of course and but we are helping we are you know we are being cooperative what's wrong with you you don't understand this uh that's just the way their minds work and it's almost everyday right right um-hum um-hum that's amazing it's amazing that people actually th e stamina that you must you know draw from yourself to deal with it it must be interesting i guess you find find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought maybe yeah well i've been finding out that i really am a nice person but it's been hidden for many years because i didn't need it uh-huh and now i need it and now it's just uh it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly i'm sure yeah and and it stays low a lot well are your are your children now do you feel comfortable um with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home or absolutely not no yeah i mean one of them i would i would um leave unsupervised any time any place any where uh the other one i wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes um-hum um-hum yeah yeah that's just a difference in kids i suppose that's true what one leads the other you know yeah oh yeah and if you and it's it's the one that's going they're going downhill is it is it the one that needs needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or on the more mature one of course yeah how unfortunate you you don't you don't think that good prevails well i you know i'm living in a dream world what do i know as i said i don't have kids and i'm an only child so i've never been around children so uh i'm sort of at a a loss where that's concerned but i do hear my friends talk about it we're we're having such fun my wife and i were both only children uh-huh and uh we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends um-hum friends um-hum wrong that's like World War Three every minute i don't know i i i have to admit i was a selfish i was selfish as a child i didn't want a brother or sister and now that i'm older of course it's different you know i think about uh wouldn't it be nice but uh anyway just make good friends yeah oh i have wonderful friends that's that's true my best friend is one child of ten so uh they just sort of you know adopted me as their eleventh child so that worked out pretty well she never had to worry about uh taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them so i guess that's that's an alternative you could just have enough um have have a whole bunch and by the time the little the youngest ones are are there you'll have old ones to take care of them yeah yeah i don't know it just see when you see all these these uh horror stories on television about child care and that's true gosh i just i was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories and of course people are denying it and uh it's just frightening it really is well what what's frightening is a parent to see things that that you don't really understand um-hum um-hum and then you don't really know what happened we gave up on one babysitter because we came home one night and found yeah pieces of um uh ribbon you know hair ribbon um-hum um-hum tied in a chair oh my where obviously she had had  okay so um how do think how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years uh i'm at a little bit of a loss you know i don't know ten years ago see i'm what i'm about uh twenty eight now so uh-huh when i was eighteen things haven't changed a whole lot people are being a little more uh really oh i don't know a little less a little less bigoted in some ways i don't know seems to me uh-huh i guess i'm like my parents the younger generation gets away with hell but uh well yeah well it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted but that may just be because i've changed you know i used to live up north Down here Dallas seems to me the police are militant but uh really where'd you live up where'd you live at i lived in Akron Ohio oh did you i'm from Illinois so how long how long you been in Dallas oh oh about eight years oh really in fact in the eight years i've been here it seems to me it gets more and more gets to be more and more restrictive place to live yeah uh you know uh as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do i think yeah well i think it's crime has gone got a lot worse in the last last ten fifteen years and maybe that has a lot to do with it oh yeah i agree yeah i i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse and you know i i think there's to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values yeah that's true so that's true but uh i'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved but that's more a matter of yeah you know i'm no longer a teenager in high school got to yeah yeah think i think there's more pressure like on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be and hello somebody's at the door hang on just a second so go ahead i'm on the phone all right okay but uh i don't know that's just that's one thing i see i see a lot more you know double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that i guess yeah that's true it's uh getting more and more expensive to live yeah that's for sure you know you can't you can't make it yeah without it hardly that's right i guess when i was growing up it was it was still the ideal to get a get a home and buy house and those good thing these days you see a lot of people living in apartments yeah forever you know you just don't buy a house yeah just because they can't get into one yeah that's right yeah the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways so yeah yeah that's that's good point so i'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years yeah i see for me it's kind of hard i don't know i think uh i don't know i think the middle class is shrinking and the uh lower class is expanding and sooner or later there's going to there's going to be a turn around oh yeah i agree well i hope so you know at some point but i don't know at what point yeah but i think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class uh yeah so usually is i think yeah it's uh it's hard for me to say i hope it happens because i'd be one of those that gets caught but on the other hand there's a lot of injustice that needs to be be changed yeah that's right do you work at T I yeah do you yeah what what uh department do you work in i'm in semiconductor are you so i'm in semiconductor division too yeah so how long you been with them since you moved down here about eight years yeah um i'm over at the Center One building yeah so am i are you really what floor yep two i'm on the seventh floor really how about that well it's a small world so so let's see second floor you work for uh Linear yeah do you do you uh do you know Alec Morton yeah i've probably seen him around oh you do huh well he comes up and pushes us around so uh so um so i'm pretty familiar with are you D A D or something up there are you D A D or something huh yeah yep you must know him his reputation precedes him yeah well seventh floor yeah T A D well uh he uh boy he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief they they say it's what makes him happy is to give us DADers grief so i can believe it but well yeah let's see if you've been in Dallas eight years guess i guess that's about how long i've i've been in here about eight years too i guess um been with T I like twelve but i started out in Lubbock and uh Lubbock Lubbock is i don't know i guess if this is the only place you've lived Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas yeah flat dry and dirty but yeah yeah but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back too i mean here in Dallas everything is just real rush rush yeah i lived in the country for several years and living in the city is a whole different uh social structure but uh oh yeah well i got s ome friends that uh seems like he went to school at like DeVry is there a DeVry in Akron i don't even know haven't been up there in years oh oh i see well he went to school somewhere in Ohio and he's from that area and uh he works over in the Park Park Central building i think but uh i haven't talked to him in a while but um yeah he he misses it he used to go back twice or three times a year you know because he missed it sounds like you haven't been back there in a while no i haven't been back in fifteen ten fifteen years you still have relatives back there or yeah i do i just haven't had a chance to get back oh um catch them next year probably really well let's see how how long are we supposed to talk here i don't know i think we ran out of social social changes to talk about so yeah well my my kids are probably needing me to go so okay all right well it's nice talking to you talk to you later bye yeah all righty bye  okay uh i really haven't thought about the topic of drug testing but uh just off the top of my head i've i don't think i see much wrong with it um if i owned a company and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that i had uh coming in uh were trust worthy et cetera and so on i think i would i would uh probably do the random testing just to insure that my company uh runs safely and smoothly yeah um i i also haven't thought too much about it uh but i suspect it it it very much depends upon the job um-hum um-hum maybe there are some jobs where i guess it doesn't really hum yeah that i mean it's it's if if it's not affecting someone's performance i'm not sure if it's a problem um-hum yeah if if it's a position a a position where it could potentially affect that's true i didn't think about that like for instance uh if someone's working on heavy machinery or uh say driving trucks or buses city buses or something like that you know if if right then that is something that affects the affects then affects the community you know if you're if you're drinking or on drugs or whatever you're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands that don't right and then if you're a computer operator and uh there's really no big deal i think you know then then then maybe it's not yeah yeah necessary yeah for me i think that drug testing just it it follows the path that society's going in if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs um-hum i mean it's just it's just where society is right now and you know something we have to cope with and i think the drug testing is something that drug users have to cope with but yeah well i think it it may i mean that in in in that respect i think it may help a lot i think it may be pushing people away from hopefully push people away from drug use if they know that you know well if you use drugs you won't get this job i mean um-hum yeah yeah i think that may be yeah that may be one of the points of it yeah of course i think um i'm not sure you know what the time span is but i mean if i think if i used drugs last week and i had a you know had a job interview that i wouldn't use drugs the day before or something and they wouldn't even see it you know i'm saying they can't they may not be able trace don't know how far you trace i don't know what the you know limits are or whatever yeah i don't know i don't know the uh that that would actually be an interesting thing to find out i think i don't i don't actually know how long those things stay in the blood in the system i've heard some you know you so some things supposedly stay for six months some stay for less some stay for longer i mean um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah they think LSD i guess stay forever in in in some ways i mean if you get flashbacks for uh hum yeah forever oh really hum i i i guess so something like that yeah i mean there must be some some something i mean people people who people get these little little flashback things you know um-hum hum of some sort so i don't really know yeah i mean i i don't use any drugs i don't really drink or anything so i'm pretty uh uh i guess decisive about that just the fact that you know if since i don't use drugs i have no problem with taking a test right well the same here actually i don't use drugs at all and i and i'm at at most a social drinker so it's so it's never a problem that just it yeah yeah yeah um-hum so the only thing i would hate is if i were to go and uh i mean it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector the lie detector test if you don't have anything to hide you're not going to mind it um-hum right you know but for people that you know don't have anything to hide and then there are some things that just aren't people's business you know that they come out at that point so i think a lot of people have trouble with that right that that that uh that's a fine line to draw and i can i can understand that um-hum um-hum i mean uh that that's really you know do you uh do you worry about you know this or that i mean you know what what what about their rights to privacy well if they're doing something illegal there they have a private you know like especially in in in the case of drinking you know if someone's yeah um-hum right is something more than a social drinker shall we say yet they're not an alcoholic what do you do um-hum yeah yeah so i mean i i took a lie detector test once and it didn't i didn't mind it but i was just offended by some of the questions i guess i mean there was one question do you like your mother you know i said yes do you hate your mother no have you ever killed your mother and i was just going you know what in the world well those are just yeah those it turns out those are just to get a um probably to get some sort of those are to get some shock value out of you or just to see what happens when you get shocked yeah there's uh um i do some i'm a student graduate student in psychology is that what it was i just okay and we sort of you know figure out um i i know a a little bit uh about that kind of stuff and what they try and do there is they want to sort of get base line measures for you you know how is it that when when you see these things and you know and and and they can look at the lines and sort of sort of get an idea um-hum hum um-hum so it kind of get kind of get something to measure my responses by i guess yeah otherwise they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping around and being fidgety and maybe they say that you would sort of it can be shocking and it they want to see how easy it is shock you yeah um-hum yeah they ask that i was going what in the world are you asking me about here you know it's just yeah but i guess i don't know some people probably have killed their mothers i don't know but yeah well i guess so i mean i guess i don't i don't what happens actually actually happens if uh um-hum if you have killed your mother yeah it's like i you get a big a big jump there you know yeah but yeah it's i think it's their way of seeing how how how well you do in a shock situation without worrying abo ut you know stuff like that so um-hum hum hm okay i never thought about that and that makes me feel a little better of course that was years and years ago and also i don't yeah yeah and i don't think that you killed your mother though i wouldn't worry about that i don't think that some thing i mean there are some people i mean because society a lot of people are taking drugs there is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives but they take a lie detector test or a drug test or whatever and the stuff that happened to them you know five years ago comes up and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better you know when they might be actually trying to improve their lives you know um-hum yeah that's uh you know it it it it could blow things right away for them you know unless they say well look i mean unless they walk it won't um-hum um-hum i'm thinking walk in and say look i did do drugs you know a year ago and i'm off them for a year now and this and that and so if you take if i take i'll be happy to take the test but it will show up positive of course i think um-hum um-hum yeah yeah i would probably do that and i'd probably bring something in showing that i had been to such and such hospital for help or you know whatever the twelve month program or whatever it is that that they do yeah yeah because then i mean then although legally they can't discriminate you i think on the basis but i'm not sure um-hum but i don't i don't really know i don't know what the laws are pertaining to this my wife probably does but yeah yeah i'm not sure what they are either i don't i don't of this stuff but but yeah it's it's it's it's an interesting topic that they've actually thought about your right in that it doesn't um-hum yeah i the other day we had talked about uh capital punishment oh i and i really i really hadn't thought uh thought about it i mean i think about it because i hear about it but i hadn't sit had to sit down and and say well what do i think about it you know and that's kind of like today i'm not real sure what i think about it i'm kind of you know in in the middle on that one um-hum yeah well these these are tough i i sort of like this it makes you think um-hum um-hum um-hum really really so i think that's that's real good um-hum okay it was very nice talking to you okay take care bye-bye well been nice talking to you too bye-bye  are you still there okay it worked that time okay yes okay well we just ate out um had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late and we had Italian um have you ever been to the Olive Garden no i haven't is that good it yeah well do you really like Italian food it's it's not my favorite but i like it okay then don't then then this'll probably be i mean this isn't really excellent Italian food that sounds terrible to tell you go go somewhere where it's not that great but it's um uh-huh you're not going to believe this i have to tell you this if i don't because you're in Plano that that's okay but my um unit here is acting like he's dying of tramane poison it wasn't that bad actually it's very good it's all the um for for run adult males uh-huh which i'm not Italian no it's uh it's all the garlic bread and all the uh salads you can eat with uh an entree oh oh oh that sounds really good so it wasn't too bad it really wasn't but i was more in the mood for French toast anyway so yeah yeah but i really like Italian food though but do you have any favorite well are there just the two of you uh yes uh-huh okay well when my husband and i go out we have four children so that makes a difference for us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best oh you're kidding oh sure but we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and and feed the whole family like that yeah and you can usually get a variety of what you're looking for like at Gatti's or something like that right right but when my husband and i go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere and we usually head on down um oh what's the freeway down here uh six thirty five uh-huh yeah and there are um all along that that freeway there are are restaurants but one of our favorites is Pappasito's oh yeah Pappasito's we went there on my birthday in March it's great no we love to go there yeah you know it always kills me because i don't like the the decorations so much it's too too much like a bar naturally and Mexico yeah i know i've seen it yeah but i love the food i love the food they just are great the food is probably i'm not a i'm i'm not a Mexican food gourmet by any means but it's probably the best tasting i i don't know if it would you classify that as Tex-Mex yeah um-hum um the shredded beef the the type of spices or sauces they use yeah uh-huh i like to get uh uh a shrimp uh it's a shrimp dish and i don't remember the name of it but it's rolled up into into something and it oh it's really good that's good every every really uh-huh i've never had anything there that wasn't delicious even yeah they really good even though you have to stand in line and all that that's the only thing i don't like about it too it's a little bit with the the meat market atmosphere you know even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to um be around not to be around that yeah yeah yeah um i'm trying to think of what else we like to eat the one thing i notice it's it's just um about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt i mean we find it prohibited just the cost anymore um-hum yeah um i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars yeah it's very expensive yeah and i don't know how you feel about that but i think some of it's over priced yeah yeah that's true i'm glad i'm talking about food normally these conversations are sometimes it's hard isn't it to keep a yeah it is i don't know um no sometimes Mark and i that's my husband Mark uh go to the August Moon which is down there it's a Chinese uh restaurant with the lions in the front um-hum uh-huh oh yeah my husband likes that yeah off of Arapaho down there yeah August Moon uh-huh yeah and uh it's pretty good as far as Chinese food goes but uh Chinese isn't my favorite so i don't like it at all usually so but he likes it kind of so he says that's a good place now me i'm i'm like i said seafood i'm i like that yeah i love seafood and i i like a lot of different ethnic foods i like Japanese food there's a place on Greenville um called Sagar's uh um well we haven't been in years down near Presby and i had a meeting down there today and i saw that and i i said gee i remember that they offer you um authentic Japanese feeding or American or piano bar ooh and i remember when we went we were married with another couple that was just dating and um i had never had sake it made all the raw fish taste great uh-huh uh-huh but if you're ever looking for a very uh it's very pretty inside and the girls wear kimonos and you know if you're ever looking for that um but what other kind of foods gee i don't know um we went to a place called Grishman's in Greenville is it oh how nice yeah which was really over priced i don't know that's was it um-hum but great desert bar um that's what we need isn't it no there's lots of nice barbecue places here now i like barbecue okay Texas barbecue and that's good yeah yeah i like barbecue have you ever been to the i think it's called Spring Creek Barbecue yeah they have pretty good food yeah yeah now they're real good yeah they're good there had oh and my husband's going upstairs and he said and free ice cream i didn't know they had that oh i can't talk i had chocolate Bavarian tort for desert today which i never eat at lunch and it was wonderful yeah yeah free ice cream yeah oh is to die for i bet ooh it was yeah in fact if i could pick my um restaurants on how their coffee is and how their French bread is and the butter and the desert i would be in heaven yes i would be in hog heaven and how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want or do you still order for them or well my two littlest i just had a baby and she's six months and then my four year old he he still but my other two older two they can so they're they're they're oh congratulations uh-huh they're kind of my my littlest girl she's still like wants McDonald's McDonald's McDonald's yeah everybody every child that i even know that eats vegetables um below below five years old still after a certain age realize that there is something called McDonald's oh i'm telling you it's really sad isn't it because it's hard to get them away from junk then well it's kind of funny is sometimes we're like we all want different things and so there's a Fifteenth Avenue down here um-hum um-hum i know where that yeah and along that street are all these fast food restaurants so we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing and then we go to a park over there so we can all have our own that's on the nights we can't decide right that's all um-hum well that's all right as long as that i was going to say because with six people how do you um with two we have a problem i mean i can't even imagine you know trying to uh you sound like you're doing pretty well there with four children well i love them they're good kids that's the way to yeah well we're getting ready to i shouldn't say this on this conversation but it's just on my mind we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt so oh how nice yeah we're excited it'll be neat i think it'll be worth it and somebody said to me in terms of this is food so i can say this but they said you have to bring the formula and i said what's that oh they laughed and i said well you know uh food's food i'm thirty something and i and i said is that what makes them drool anyway you know i guess it are you is it a little bit constricted because a lot of restaurants don't take in terms of talking about restaurants i mean are a lot of restaurants yeah yeah yeah how are they when you have children let alone three or four children you have to be careful if you go to a a restaurant that that really is more adult you know with the atmosphere and everything they if you're like we could probably take our oldest son and our oldest daughter uh-huh sure um-hum um-hum and they know how to act i don't i don't think i'd chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a distraction and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing and yeah the yuppie kind of crowd yeah yeah i just i just i've been in some places where they say they take children and then i've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude you know and that always just bothered me um what yeah so yeah on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves i don't know what other kind of restaurants really Pappasito's we love um we went to one Italian back on the Italian we went to some place across from Collin Creek Mall yeah yeah it was absolutely putrid for Italian food i can't remember the name of it it's on um oh is it Tia's not Tia's um i can't yeah no that's Mexican um it's right across from on the Dillard's side there or Folley's yeah i know which one it is and i can't think of it i can't it's in the strip yeah and it it had white tablecloth i think it was like paper where you could write on them or something with crayons and it was just terrible yeah oh dear i mean i was shocked i mean the dish was dirty um it's one of those ones you have a bad experience and say i don't think i'll come back here yeah where you felt like you were right like you're in a bad part of Italy Italy or something yeah oh dear oh um boy but other than that i don't know we we do our share of pizza eating too but it's more like uh go get it and carry it in because we're too cheap to pay the delivery and i don't like strange people coming to my door um oh yeah yeah yeah well i i've about said what what what my favorites were and i can't really think of any other uh me too no except it just makes me fat no i'm just kidding but you can places uh yeah you have to watch it if you go out to eat that's true yeah that's true but you can always blame it on having children no yeah yeah there you go well i enjoyed talking to you and i guess you know well good luck maybe we'll see you in the restaurants somewhere okay uh-huh bye bye-bye yeah maybe okay bye-bye  okay you know it's uh i'm a CPA so i use computer quite a bit uh i'm not sure why they call them sometimes call them personal computers uh i guess they mean just one that's in your home yeah right well yeah actual i think they mean one that's that is uh designed or designated dedicated for one person to use primarily as opposed to uh large mainframe computer uh-huh which you know several people maybe use uh terminals tied to it i guess that's that's my definition anyway okay i guess that's like the ones in TI right um i have an IBM it's uh one they call the XT which is one of the earlier models Prior to that i had uh one that was a Heath Kit computer which is one that i basically built myself oh in your home uh yeah and uh so i've had uh i've had a computer for uh oh about ten years little over ten years i guess now oh uh-huh how do you know about building you own computer well you uh Heath Kit which is uh you know one of these uh electronic stores it's a hobby store place uh-huh and you can go there and buy a kit or at least you use to be able to i'm not sure that you can still buy those from them now but you could buy a kit and build a computer it like have a would have a manual step-by-step manual to go through and put all the parts together was that a little less expensive uh yeah it uh it then it was and of course the computer are so cheap now i'm not even sure how it would how it would compare uh oh back then the computer that i built was uh one you know was a old pretty low level technology wise and uh it cost me oh fifteen hundred dollars i guess to build it huh and it would have cost eighteen hundred or so to buy i think so it was you know it was not a great saving but it was a learning experience any way oh seems like it would be more fun any way my husband gets a kick out of building stuff for his self rather than buying it yeah yeah if uh if he's if he's aware of building you know building electronic stuff he's he knows about Heath Kit probably no he's not into electronics i'm just saying per se he just likes to build stuff but uh not into electronic right but uh you know i had to had to learn a little bit about uh using a solder iron and and that kind of stuff well i i say uh i said basically i built it myself when i got to a certain point i took it to a TI engineer that uh was a friend of my wife's and uh-huh he uh you know he worked with help me finished putting it together you know and make it work right it uh so you know if you don't know much electronics you can you know you have to have somebody with a little electronic background to make it work but uh you know the basic stuff i i did all the basics any way somebody to help do you use your computer for home uh no well i use mine at work i don't i don't even have one at the house any more it's uh i've got it in my office and uh matter fact i'm market for another one uh-huh is that for your house or for your office oh okay no for my home you know so i mean for my for my office so i'm i'm not sure eventually i'll have to i'll probably have one at home too but uh well couldn't you like um i'm pretty sure you can do this have it one in your home that has the same stuff in it as your office does or have it kind of connect it oh yeah oh well you can have them connected by a by a modem if you want to which is a telephone line uh-huh but but you can can have the same software you know the same programs just contains a so that you take your data files from one to the other so that you can use same computer you know for the for the okay right a a different computers for the same project right okay so you know it's and that's that's one thing that i would like to have uh occasionally i need to work at home you know and now i don't have a computer there so you could just bring your disk home and do it you know that's i could if i you know if i if i had a computer there so yeah that was my problem in school i could not write programs um-hum i loved messing with the computer though but i just could not yeah to a certain point i'd just get messed up and i would be totally lost yeah so but uh you know it's uh you know the computer it's uh the you know growing thing in uh you know both home and business i i think eventually yeah i want i'm wanting to go back to school and this time i'll try a lot harder yeah that's but eventually i think uh most homes will have a computer you know for some reason uh either uh-huh well a lot of them more or less close the computers the uh microwaves all have these new little buttons and right yeah just about every thing is getting computerized yeah new cars have computer in them and yeah have you seen that uh thing that shows the maps uh no i haven't seen that but i have heard about it but i haven't seen it i think that's neat yeah but uh i don't know i guess the uh the personal computer is it's really uh going to be a necessity that you know children should learn to use it i was just commenting i teach uh a couple accounting classes and uh i was just commenting the other night that it's uh going to reach the point where um accounting classing in college have to have computer for the students to use you know in every class uh right now i teach over at Brookhaven College and there's only one class that i happen to teach that that teaches the accounting students anything about using the computer if they want to use want to learn the computer they have to take classes outside of the accounting area uh-huh okay now a friend of mine is trying is going for CPA and she is having to take uh-huh or she maybe maybe it's just a preference that she's taking it on herself but she is taking a computer class yeah and uh but yeah it's that's something that's going to be uh a necessity for accountants because you you know it's you can do so much for more work with a computer then you can do you know doing it manually yeah and uh and a lot more accurately also i use the computer to do you know all of my accounting work and of course i write letters on the computer and i do income tax on the computer so it's i use it a lot i do our income taxes too and you're right it probably would be a lot easier if i the use a computer yeah you know it's just it would be if you have a computer you can buy you know some little cheap software that uh that uh you can buy like at Software House here in Richard in uh Dallas at uh over in Addison uh-huh you can go over there and buy an income tax package that will run on a personal computer and do your income tax and it's one of those where you can change things y ou know to see what happens you know you say well let's see i've got some many uh so much of my charitable contributions on my itemized deductions and then you discover that you had more then you thought you did you can go in and change it uh-huh and it changes everything on the return and you don't have to go back and you know change every line with you know the eraser or the and redo everything the uh liquid paper or whatever right huh so it's it's really convenient to have that plus you know you've got it on the computer and it does all the calculations and the math and you know makes for a lot of your errors on the return yeah well so far i've had been able to use the easy form yeah so uh-huh just me and my husband right but uh so now i'm wanting for my little boy's birthday is coming up and i was thinking about getting him just one of those little i know i they've got toy computers more or less just for kids who just starting and he'll be four uh-huh yeah but i've seen it on uh like twenty twenty and stuff whatever where they do have little third graders and stuff working on yeah they uh start are starting real early on the computers when he gets to school he will probably be using a computer uh-huh you know yeah second or third grade probably and uh uh-huh he'll he'll know more about computer then you will and you'll be having to go back to school just too keep up with him probably but i think that's the way it goes with most parents yeah that seems to have to learn have to learn a little bit as they go along you you suddenly discover that your educated when the students are uh-huh a lot well go ahead well it's been a it's been interesting taking uh about computers it's uh that's one of my favorite subjects and uh i really i get into talking about them so don't know much about them yeah so the main thing i didn't i don't even remember them having computers on uh that little sheet um yeah yeah i don't remember i i've checked off a bunch of stuff you know on there i don't remember what all was on there but i've talked about two or three things that i wasn't you know wasn't expecting to talk about so but uh uh-huh well it's been pretty interesting so far yeah yeah so it's been been nice talking to you and uh i guess uh maybe they'll ring us up again sometime yes all righty all right bye-bye okay thanks bye-bye  hi okay uh do you have a budget we sure do as a matter of fact i do the finances in the family and what i do is take uh entire take home pay and then i like divvy it up into sections into the house into the car into the utilities anything that's to do with the house like utilities or electric or anything like that goes into the house budget and then i have one for the food and one for um and and each of these is allotted a certain amount of money and hopefully we stay within that budget and then uh we have some for uh debt and some for just plain family you know like if the kids need clothes or if um oh i don't know you know if something something in the house well the house one gets the money for the budget if we need something new in the house or something like that um-hum and that's pretty much how we do it does does it i mean does it work pretty good i mean you are you able to stay on track pretty much yeah um-hum it does uh now the way that we can really get off track is if i start to pull money from something and put it into another into another budget like if i um-hum have money put into the house budget and all the bills that go with that and i start siphon siphoning money out of that like into the food bill budget um-hum um to buy more food and i don't do that usually but when it does happen then i get into problems with you know then i have to take money from somewhere else to pay the bills on the house and i don't like to do that then you can get really into trouble and that doesn't happen very often because i'm pretty strict i don't usually take money from anywhere uh-huh unless i absolutely have to yeah we don't we don't really have a budget per se we pretty much know what our bills are and you know ours ours is pretty simple but uh but what i do have i do have we do have a plan where we do put X number of dollars away um-hum um-hum every month both through the employment uh sectors and also privately in in an investment portfolio um-hum so that goes we take that out right off the top well that's great um-hum course the employment comes out before you ever see it but then the other stuff the private stuff we take out and then we disburse it into those uh accounts before we even start the rest uh but on the budget we of course we haven't really gotten into trouble by not having a budget yet i can see definitely see that there is a need for one though and probably as my daughter gets a little bit older and we start getting involved in in other major purchases and things like that we'll have to do that uh it's it's kind of a good thing with my husband's company we can allot a certain amount of money and all of our we have four children each of our children have a savings account and then there's a basic savings account like a family one um-hum and what the his um company does for us is we allot a certain amount and like you said uh they take they just take that straight out of the paycheck and put it right in the savings account we don't even see that money we can take it i mean it's well available to us if we want to take it out but uh we just try not to touch that um-hum but you know and so we try not to even take that as part of our budget we just try to put that right away in savings it's very difficult sometimes to to not think and say well God we have a little bit in savings let's you know but you have to be quite um adamant and say you're not going to touch that so yeah yeah we we have a we have one savings account that we have jointly um-hum that we can take out of if we if we decide we want something yeah but that's the only one we touch everything else we have we have promised each other we will not touch anything else in fact like CDs and money markets and all kind of stuff we've got it set up to where it takes both of us to sign it i think that's great so in case one of us decides to get weak or something like that you know say well you know if we won't miss this or we won't miss that you know uh so our our investment portion of it we don't we don't even touch it if we get low on money or we we go other avenues we don't yeah right we don't ever touch that so yeah we don't touch the kids we do have the joint one like you said and we do fluctuate money in that one if we want to and then there's one other thing that we have and and we don't touch the money in that one so yeah we do the same for our daughter we have uh of course when she was born we just took you know a lump sum of money and put it in a C D um-hum that's really good as one one means and then we took i take a hundred dollar savings bond out of every paycheck that's good that's goes directly for for her and then we also have a savings account which we do put X number of dollars in per month which is able to at least build her education fund you know and that's so important because today things can be so expensive they really can well if you if you really look at it the kids that are are born today by the time it's college time which will be it will be cost prohibitive if if parents don't do it that's right exactly kids cannot make money that much money in in that time frame uh working odd jobs to pay for that kind of bill it's just not possible to do it like maybe we did it when when we went to school yeah and and there i don't think there's a lot of opportunity uh in the future for grants and loans and that kind of stuff because i don't i just don't think it's going to be there yeah so i think if parents don't provide it's it's not going to be there it's too hard that's right and uh who knows how much that's going to take i mean what we're taking out now may be enough it may not be and uh just don't know or there may be far more there than is ever needed but if it's if it's extra yeah yeah exactly then she can go to dental school or any or anything else that she wants to do from from there so wouldn't that be great i think that all of those things are really important and and uh the only reason i even went to a budget was i found that we um we would oh i can't think of the word like or money would go through the cracks you know and at the end of the thing we'd go what happened to all that money the extra we had the overflow you know and it just siphons itself away somewhere into the air and so um-hum well you know i i you you brought up a real good point because i because i notice we do that occasionally we'll get it we'll get down and think where does all this go we just went out on a frivolous on a frivolous you know like a frivolous spending binge all of a sudden you know and now where did it go yeah yeah it's hard to keep track isn't it it is uh uh because i know we we have gotten ourselves into that predicament a few times um-hum but we've always managed you know to you know to get out of it fairly quickly we don't have a lot charged up on credit cards we don't have you know a lot of money going out right i think that's great uh than what we can pay for but i think if you do have a budget at least then maybe you'll have extra money sitting around that you can invest more in or do some other things that are a little bit more important yeah i didn't used to have uh a money allotted out for debt service until um i just had a baby seven months ago and she had extensive problems and and the the specialists and the hospitals that she had to have you know uh she was in the hospital for like a month and the money that accumulated in those i found i had to make that into the budget to start paying those off and then i mean the insurance oh isn 't that something pardon i say isn't that something about medical bills golly yeah i know just one little one little hiccup yeah will just about devastate you our insurance was wonderful but it didn't cover everything you know and so yeah yeah fine you have to um do some of those things and and when money is involved it can really get expensive um so anyway that's about how we handle our finances and and uh that seems to work pretty well for us yeah i keep pretty extensive records on on you know what i do and i average out you know utilities and things like that um-hum i i project ahead i usually at the end of the month when i when i pay the bills i'll usually project what i'm going to need for next month but i don't really put it aside i just you know i just try to estimate what i think it's going to come to and then yeah well see even that i think is a sort of uh a budget uh when you do that right right in some basic sense but i think a planned budget i think is is a real good idea so you just break it down in little subgroups and then you have X number of dollars what you think is adequate to pay those bills um-hum now do you save all your receipts i do we used to it got to be a great big hassle great big mess and i i just don't do that so what i have is uh a paper and uh and i put two columns my husband on one side and me on the other side uh we pay for check or else we take out of ATM services you know a certain amount of money and i write every check down for the amount of money or whoever takes money out of the ATM i write down that amount of money and as it comes through uh on on the statement then i'll block block it off in in a bright color so we know it's gone and i can see what's left out and what's left over to come through the statement to make sure that we don't overdraw ourselves or anything but uh that's the way i do it uh receipts were a big mess for me i can't do that that was just uh too much boy i know with that you receipts for everything yeah i couldn't do that so are you are you like a coupon saver too for stores and things oh yeah oh yeah you know i've i've noticed that's a big deal i i have i save every coupon i get my hands on i just uh they are such a boon to of housewives i i can't tell you hey i mean i know it's it's easy to to get hooked on that stuff because i i  the invasion of privacy is a topic that gets some people kind of mad i don't mind it too much uh it's more of a bother sometimes than it is uh a real invasion to me in that uh some of the purchases that you make if you make them with a credit card in a given location for a given amount all that stuff goes into a big computer data base and tends to go to the marketing schemes and then they will hound you forever for a particular purchase like that uh one of the the uh cards little little card i answered in the mail that had a bunch of topics would you be interested in this be interested in that an it was kind of a little survey type deal and i checked off a few things and just out of curiosity once i decided to see what would happen if i if i checked off uh about some stock uh portfolio information as it were for the different investors and within about a month i would say i had ten fifteen calls from different brokers uh asking me questions all sorts of things about what i would be willing interested in investing in and how much i had to invest and and i was kind of curious and i guess i got my answer but it was uh a bit much and to this day it has continued considerably it's i guess it's going to be hard to get off of that little list now yeah uh other little forms of of uh not really an invasion it's public record it's it's not uh not even they never told you it would be considered private but whenever you buy a house uh the purchase price is there for everybody to see where it's located is there and and uh companies that do this kind of research hire people to sit there at the at the records office and take down all this this information and put it into their format so that they can put it on to their computer and and know that a given right neighborhood is at a given age group they they know a lot about you for the on that one transaction and they know roughly what your income is if you're affording a house of that size so they want to send you literature for vacations to whatever because you're in that bracket right and marketing is uh seems to be the driving factor for most of these invasions of privacy as people call them so right yeah i guess the telephone solicitation is the one that comes to my mind yeah to me that's uh it's inexcusable if you want to come and want my money come and convince me don't call me on the phone yeah that's true i i guess that's uh where the old answering machine comes into play just screen a hundred percent of your calls and you don't have that that problem yeah i just keep my phone number listed under a separate name and when someone calls for that name i know that they're soliciting and i just tell them no they got the wrong number yeah that's the way to do it yeah works pretty good well the other some of the other problems of course are are uh invasions that are more along the lines of theft where people have allowed their carbon copies of their uh cards to get a way from them the credit cards purchases and people will uh take those and maybe steal some something off that number or just use that that information as uh you you purchased this then you know at that time because that information is not always open to the public yeah you can't always get out and find every transaction that a person makes on their MasterCard of Visa but uh a lot of of um credit references uh when you dial that in to find out well what's their latest rating uh that kind of information you don't always want everybody to know but uh it's going across uh computer lines and people can pick up what they want so right and then there's the whole issue of of uh cellular telephones and and house portable phones uh people consider that an invasion of privacy to have uh someone listening in on their their phones and ironically the laws have has classified one of them as illegal to listen to and the other one not right so it's kind of a strange deal do you have a phone that uh no i don't have a cordless people cordless that people can listen in on i don't either but uh i i happen to have a radio that will pick up that range it it's very seldom that you can get uh you just happen to be within a couple of houses of that person and you have to listen at the exact right time and it's fairly staticky and on occasion you'll get two to three of them at once because the radios usually don't have the control that's needed to right right screen them out and it's not the worlds most interesting thing to listen to but uh it it can be done relatively cheaply and i guess some people for lack of anything else to do do that kind of thing i guess a lot of the data that's being taken with you know the advent of the computer a lot of the data that's being taken on everybody you know your social security number is tied to just everything about you and i think that right constitutes an invasion of privacy not so much the fact that the data is there but the way that it's being compiled and um-hum i think the government uses is quite a bit you know if they they want to do a check background check on you they've got you everything on you from the time you got that social security card right and to me that's an invasion of my privacy yeah it's kind of sad when they they know to where you've worked where you've been what you've done you know any any kind of right uh you know you name anything that's ever happened to you is going to be tied into either your social security number or your driver's license it's kind of sad that they choose that number to identify you with because there's very few you know some people use it just because it's easy and it's unique and then some people use it to yeah you can now identify that person it's not quite so private anymore and uh i don't know i very little of the information i give out really bothers me but as far as whether i care if anybody else had it but uh i guess the idea that if you ever let it become a an all right thing to do for the masses then you'll never be able to get that privilege back once gone it's going to be gone forever right so well i think we've just about covered the topic i'm going to go ahead and let you go i got to get back to work here okay all righty bye talk to you later maybe bye  okay okay now as you were saying i said one thing we've been doing around here is trying to find ways of having uh my husband likes gourmet food uh-huh and i'm trying to figure out how how to feed him so he'll eat this stuff and the kids will eat it too and it's not going to be fattening high in fat or high in cholesterol get's to be a a real chore with little kids who basically want every thing covered in cheese right that's true um i have the same problem i've uh in fact both of us like cheese uh my children are grown now um and i also like ice cream so i just have been fortunate with that i have never really had an ice cream fetish but i'm married to somebody who just feels that you know if you offer it to him he'd eat a hot fudge sundae every night of the week oh and i hate him for it yeah well everyone has their own little things right his is ice cream or hot fudge sundaes but i tell you what we use to do even when the children were growing up every Friday night oh yeah would be our night that um uh put to kids to bed when they were younger and my wife and i would would uh she'd set the dining room table with candles and no one disturbed us no one called on Friday night and we would just have this quiet dinner for the two of us and that uh that's held up until our youngest is graduating college in the couple of weeks and we still do that wow um well we also like to do is we like to cook out a lot even in the winter time we got we got a grill and i've got like a wood shop off the garage and i've got a a like an over hang and we keep the grill out there so i just out and we you know grill steaks or salmon or whatever uh-huh um so um so i can give you something that we like to do give me something that's really easy to do or well clams casino if you like clams casino i love clams but i'm not sure what clams casino are and i don't know if i could find clams that i would eat down here in Texas oh yeah well but well i like well you lived in Boston so you know a little about you know uh-huh and in a restaurant they they just kind of serve them on a half shell with a little bit of uh stuffing what we like the to do is uh is to cut them out and then cut them into little quarters or eighths you know not so much just one big bite uh-huh and then cut up fresh peppers and fresh tomatoes and fresh celery and bread crumbs and mix it all together and pre cook bacon so it's kind of soft uh-huh and put a strip of bacon over the top of that and then and then pop them in the oven God that sounds good and we usually have that and then we'll have a salad and i'll throw a steak on the grill with uh what i call a potato bake i buy a uh couple of yams and some either red potato or either white potato and i put them in a microwave and cook them so they're fairly soft and i slice them i peel the yam slice that uh-huh i slice the white potato with the skin on i slice up a mild onion preferably a onion now in Texas it would have to be ten fifteen oh and then i put it in tin foil and i interweave put a i put a slice of white potato and slice sweet potato and slice of onion and then i do that until i got the size of a baked potato put butter and salt on it garlic close the tin foil and i throw it on the grill cause i like it a little crispy on the bottom so i throw it on the grill maybe about uh ten minutes before i put the steak on and then once once the steak is done that's usually done and then we have uh God that sound wonderful and then either spinach i like spinach or uh asparagus because we grow own asparagus we have asparagus patch so in fact right now it's it's in season so we just go out and there lop off a few and then whatever you want for desert well i'll give you one that that that i i put together modified out of a Heart Smart Cookbook now my husband really thinks that this is one of those French fancy French sauces oh so when he when he request this i always tell him he has to take the kids for an hour and it really only takes about fifteen or twenty minutes to do but it gives me forty five minutes to sit by myself where it's quiet that's nice but what you do is you go take you can use pork tender loin it's more expensive but i and i like the leaner cut of pork yeah the um like the center cut pork chops uh-huh and you you need to have them thick at least a three-quarters of an inch think okay and all you do is take those things and coat them in lemon pepper marinade okay on both sides um when you say lemon pepper marinade you put lemon juice and pepper together no just the uh the you know you can do that just that you buy just lemon pepper the spice that you buy okay all right and then you take about two tablespoons of butter which you know most people kind of go you know this is a low fat recipe but it is oh yeah and you just melt that in a skillet okay you broken the uh the pork chops or the pork fillets okay uh-huh you just brown them on both sides and i like to get them at a good golden brown yes and then just take them and stick them on a plate and keep them warm and into that same skillet add the juice of lemon about anywhere from a quarter to a half a cup to that you add two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce two and one teaspoon to a tablespoon depending on how much you like it two tablespoons wait wait a minute that was two tablespoons of Worcestershire uh yeah Worcestershire okay and then anywhere from a teaspoon to a tablespoon of Dijon mustard and what you do is you just cook this down and it makes a a really pretty almost dark black brown viscous sauce uh-huh it's pretty spicy now i like to throw in just a you know a shot of white wine and then you just take the pork chops put them on a serving platter pour this sauce over it and i garnish it with fresh cut chives it really is a really pretty entree to look at um uh-huh and the sauce i mean it has kind of this nice complex flavor where you feel that somebody's you know played around with this all afternoon yeah that and i have served it to company so so you cooked the the pork is cooked at that point then okay and uh-huh but you know the trick with pork most people think you have to cook it at a hundred and eighty five degrees well done oh no no you don't have to do that it can still be pink in the middle and that makes all the world of difference oh uh um the other thing that that i've really got into down here in Texas is fresh uh herbs that's what we do we we grow our own and dry them and oh yeah um well see i don't have to try them cause they'll they'll pretty much grow all winter long and if yeah you guys are kind of lucky down there oh i don't know we also have you know foot long roaches all year long too yeah yeah hey don't laugh don't laugh but what makes a really elegant um just a side dish and most people don't have any idea what it is why they don't i don't know and you can make it a day ahead of time because i just take about a cup of fresh cut basil i mean i really like basil yes and then cook spaghetti and i the the this is smaller thread spaghetti it's like the cappelletti is the better okay yep add and i add almost equal parts parmesan cheese a a healthy balance of garlic i mean i really like garlic oh that's what we do we yeah yeah so you're basically makes a kind of a a pesto like a pesto yeah yes but if you serve it cold it really is just a wonderful so is it a cup of basil leave fresh basil leaves uh-huh uh-huh and pine nuts and if you can't get pine nuts because to me they're always kind of mushy i just grind up walnuts and use that in it uh it really is nice yeah that's uh and even my kids will eat it and they've gotten to be kind of food snobs one of them went over to we're going we're going to have that Friday we're going to do the pork and we don't have the we don't have any fresh basil but we've got dried well we'll have to go down to the market dry basil doesn't have quite the taste it doesn't you can't pesto out of it they've got some pesto frozen though yeah i keep i do that and i find that it tastes just about as good and i freeze it in like little half cup quantity so i can even pull it out whenever i want to but i like that i like those uh-huh i like that sauce with the pork you you'll be surprised you'll be really surprised at just how simple it is and and it's not a a clear cut you know this this this and this it's kind of to taste and yeah that's what i'm going to do because we each take turns doing it you know i usually do the grill work and you know it depends if she makes uh uh anything with shrimp on it or not you know she'll do that but i'll do the grill stuff but this is nice this is i can cook the pork on the grill uh-huh and just make the sauce you know what also is really good just really really good and really really simple if you like to do grilling if you can get a hold of fresh sage yep yep have you ever worked with that just take the fresh sage and and you know crumble it so that you you release the oils yep pour you know put that stuff over fresh pork chops and if you've got balsamic vinegar there we do we make all of our vinegars in fact we do canning too we do all of our own canning and oh i love that stuff oh i do my own vinegars too but just put a a touch of balsamic vinegar on that until  um i think life uh now i grew up on a farm i don't what kind did you grow up in the farm i grew up in um well at that time i was in a uh Trenton New Jersey so and it was a suburb of Trenton so i really had mixture of suburb and urban living uh-huh i see i see well little little bit different i think though it was much slower and uh yeah much much more self-contained i think you're right it's interesting i'm um i work in a high school uh-huh so uh i'm comparing my life when i was in high school thirty years ago to what i see these children doing yes and the pressures on the children uh you know you hear this as an excuse but it's true they are so much greater unreal unreal by comparison oh i cannot believe uh what they're doing uh academically the demands on them and uh and i can see why children do drop out yeah i think that's right i i can remember as a child you know nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted to go i can see i can see uh you know uh-huh uh-huh it wasn't it didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me they were and then you didn't you didn't have to lock your door no no and uh a live and some of these are urban worries but uh it's uh it's a lot different all though i guess twenty years a go now in this area things were um similar because twenty years ago let's see it was after it's not all that long ago is it yeah twenty twenty five years ago is when we had the Washington riots the first rights we've been having some problem now and it reminded me of that uh-huh uh-huh yeah we were living in New Jersey uh-huh uh in uh twenty years ago whereabouts uh in uh Allendal uh-huh and uh i use to have to go over to Patterson when those riots were going on at sometimes um uh-huh i don't know though it's it's kind of hard to really know because of though the news media had those riots uh kind of blown up out of proportion uh-huh well the Washington riots weren't because because i went there many times and i never i never saw a riot the Washington riots weren't because i lived right downtown Washington and uh and what you saw is was what you got i'm telling you did you that's what yeah well huh yeah but you know it's it is interesting uh they're so many more they're different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures uh the pressures of drug is so much the prevalence is so much greater the the kinds of diseases that you've got out the uh-huh uh i mean the consequences is so much what's going on is so much more serious yeah i think that's true i think that's true then when we were younger i think the other thing is that uh we have taken some rather drastic turns in our in our education and the way we approach things as of maybe starting back when when i'm number one you know and uh uh uh worrying about the self and not uh seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family uh-huh uh-huh and uh and there have been many things that have happened that have not encouraged uh closeness of families and uh support for young people that the kind of support that they need to help them take care of the things if you don't have some kind of yes and of basic belief or something down inside of you then it's very difficult to uh-huh uh to have anything to turn to when you got when you've got something facing you like that that's true i also being involved in the school system see so many of problem children coming from their parents um children who will lie and cheat and you approach their parents and their parents are constantly justify them rather than to uh-huh uh you know they're constantly uh uh excusing their child and you can see exactly why the child is that way you can as a teacher can't hold a child accountable like right now exactly yeah if you're not going to get reinforced by that at home that's right that's right and you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day what's not been done for fifteen or sixteen years at home no that's right oh and you're get you get mixed signals so it's it's not always the school's systems i think a lot of it is the families and no there's so much more then that it starts very much deeper then that i think that too i see some flickers of the way you were mentioning yeah yeah of uh of good directions turning but whether they're soon enough and fast enough i don't know it's just course life is a lot more complicated too in ways um the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained for now right uh you know with farming being so mechanized uh people working on the family farm which was a traditional American way uh-huh if that uh becomes less and less likely factory jobs are so much more um uh sophisticated yeah that's right and the kinds of knowledge that uh you know it it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force and some people just don't have it it's uh right and there's so much so so many people on the lower end of those who who are going to be the the drop outs and the and you worry with you know the effects of and the poor and the homeless and whatnot the effect of drugs on the young children and the unborn children uh in terms of what it's going to mean to a society in the future it's a some ways it's rather frightening rather yeah that's just another yeah it really is it's just it it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think of it certainly is of the jobs that is out there to be done well it sure is in order to flip things back around the way they needed to be it sure is uh not that i really think that they were perfect ten twenty or thirty years ago but it was a little easier though wasn't it uh yeah just the volume makes a big difference i that's yes as uh as uh mother you know i use to think sometimes it's not so much uh it's not so much the kids it's just the volume of it to try to keep all wash done and all the things done and you know and everything yeah and they all the things demanded of the mother too i mean uh i look at my mother's life uh right i mean she she didn't work um um for a long time uh when i was very young she didn't drive uh she learned to drive i think when i was um a teenager and her life was a lot simpler and i right and and and children's lives were simpler because mother was there somebody was there that's right that's right that's right and and when there's nobody there i always thought too that you know people worrying about going to work when their child when their children are little and i and i think that's sad if they have to because they miss so much but i i believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go to go work was when they were teenagers they need you more as a teenager isn't that true that's why i'm working in a school system so that i'm home when they're home um right it's not so much that they come to you every minute but it's that you are there when they need you that's exactly isn't that that's so true uh uh i find working in a high school yeah it's very helpful because it let's me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do yeah and it keeps me from being the old foggy but at the same time it also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes yeah yes i think that's true as to what's come but that's the same i'm home at the summers i'm home with the holidays yeah that's i'm home at three o'clock when the children are at home or where home one is now a senior in high school and the other's in college yeah well and uh it's uh it does it but that helps a lot i have a daughter who just uh had a second job she needed need to work and she opted to go into a day care center where she could take her children with her uh-huh uh-huh and uh and looked a long time before she found one that was laid back enough so they she would be able to interact with them and uh that's right and felt like they were getting you know uh a good kind of experience as well well i'm but uh i think that's really important i don't think people realize how important it is that's that is that is so true and it's not that always that the children always say something but every once in awhile they'll come up and make a comment yeah you yeah and you realize uh it's important that and and yet you know we have to make that choice i think um twenty thirty years ago a lot of women didn't have to make that choice yeah yeah i think that's right what was what is your name again well Linda Lee uh-huh Linda okay and your name was well i think probably that we've just about i don't haven't change the world but well i enjoyed talking with you well i enjoyed talking with you yes it's nice talking to you too bye now okay bye-bye uh-hum  okay um do you like to cook well i love to cook as a matter of fact i'm making dinner right now oh really what are you making um i um i'm making some uh i have a little turkey left from a passover which which which was in April uh-huh and i had frozen it and i'm defrosting that and making some defrosting some gravy and making corn and this wheat pilaf stuff that you can buy at a store which is like uh rice pilaf but we with with with wheat kernel that uh-huh and do you cook i mean are you single do you cook every night for yourself no um i'm married and actually the my wife is a vegetarian uh-huh so this isn't for her this is for our friends that came over and helped helped me do some stuff so stuff so he and i and and she's having i i do cook um virtually i cook most of the time because i uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well like if you were having a dinner party what would you cook a variety of things i mean you know vegetarian and nonvegetarian yeah we we consistently if we cook if if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier uh-huh so we'll make something you know uh some sort of pasta or something you know homemade pasta or lasagna or something uh-huh yeah that's something that's you know really easy in fact i'm having a dinner party next Saturday and that is what i'm having is pasta oh good idea what well for for Christmas i got a um pasta machine and all all my friends are really anxious you know to have the homemade noodles so um um electric or uh no it's the hand kind old fashion kind best kind that that that that's we we bought one in Italy that's the best kind to have uh-huh yeah yeah i like you know kind of still having in put that not everything's being done for me you know uh-huh that's real good but um yeah so that's what i'm going to be cooking you know i thought i would have like an antipasta um salad first and um then just something for desert you know bread and wine and cheese stuff like that um that would be great have you made pasta before uh-huh um so you know so you know that it's a a lot of fun actually yeah yeah yeah a lot of people think though that i've talked to about it think that it's you know a lot of hard work and i said heck it's kind of easy i it actually is if if if you have a food processor i don't know if you have a food processor or not actually it it turns out that if if if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply yeah i do uh-huh and then um and with that it it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta by throwing in some spinach or some tomato or something and mixing it up it it it it's just a snap from there and then you get to roll it out yourself right right uh-huh uh-huh i made yucky i making yucky every now and then as well uh-huh it's also people think it's real hard it just time consuming to get all of the little things right otherwise it's real simple it's good stuff uh-huh uh-huh what other kinds of uh dinner parties do you serve um well i don't entertain that often uh when i do though i i have some friends that i always like to experiment on but you know um i see a recipe and think oh wow i'd really like to try this cause i'm single and i live by myself uh-huh so it's not necessarily something that i would cook just for myself right you didn't want to cook so i'll say okay you guys are experimental i want say how this is going to turn out but here we go and usually i'm i'm pretty good about it that's great um i have this really good recipe for this um pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing and um you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything and my girlfriend and her husband loved it in fact she passed it on to her parent and huh so it's like it really made the rounds and i was quite impressed with myself if i should say so well that yeah that's the way these things sort of make it is you make it for one person as an experiment and uh-huh i usually find it when i make up for the first time i usually doctor it just a little bit you know my own way here and there and it works real well uh-huh uh-huh well i'm the kind of cook that i don't normally measure things i just kind of throw them in and you know i don't to the point of you know measuring down to the exact amount that they say that means you're a real cook oh is that what it means if you've ever watched the ones on television like uh Jeff Schmidt the super gourmet he he just throws takes stuff he says yeah about an ounce of this or something uh-huh it's real good yeah we have a uh-huh we do uh uh middle eastern dinner quite a bit actually or uh we have people other that have never experienced it before and haven't had much middle eastern food uh-huh no i haven't we make uh because we're my wife is Syrian and um her families always have this food she grew up in and i've made some of it before as well so we make uh four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh we put them out for people and and that's always a real big kick for people who want you know who've never tried it before uh-huh that's that's that's that's a fun idea i mean if you ever uh want something different to try uh-huh i would try that um yeah i've been wanting to take an um oriental cooking class and i just haven't gotten around to it yet oh do you have a wok though yeah those yeah yeah i stir fry things on occasion but i'd like to know more about you know more elaborate things i guess i think it's God's gift to cooking because it's just quick it's easy um and the food just comes out you know if you do it right i think it comes out uh-huh uh-huh the food comes out very tasty not very mushy you know and and it doesn't taste like a million calories of oil so um-hum uh-huh we live live in our wok uh-huh really yeah we we we like to eat even when we eat out and stuff we eat a lot of Chinese food or Japanese food or you know Korean or something or Vietnamese or something uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and that seems to so wok food seems to be our thing uh-huh so anything else you cook um i just kind of you know cook here cook there i don't have any one specialty i mean i'm always willing to try anything usually well that's good that's always the way to do it i think it's the and i i especially like baking and making deserts i've taken a cake decorating class and oh the Wilson course no no actually it was a private course through like a company i like it that's great i haven't the the the thing i really want to do i keep seeing the signs for the the Wilson class it is it's it's neat but it takes a long time you know i mean like i'm elected to always bring cakes into work like for people's birthdays and that and it's like you know you bake the cakes and then i guess just because i don't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it like you know some a professional would i try to i go real slow and you know it's a little time consuming but it's really worth your effort once you see how you do right uh-huh yeah oh yeah we have um my brother can do it he's he's uh got a degree in business management so he learned to uh how to do this really well uh-huh uh-huh can you hold on one second thank you sure thank you sorry about that that's okay some one kept beeping in our calling waiting over and over again so uh-huh uh-huh yeah he he does does that a lot so you know he cooks a lot so uh-huh but you know he bakes a lot whenever he when when my wife and i got married the night before we had a party or two nights before and he baked us he made a real big cake himself uh-huh uh-huh did it up and we have a friend who can do for New Years our friend made a baby cake like a baby New York oh my uh-huh it was amazing uh-huh i never have can't do anything with cakes so i get the mold i put i put it on you know the frosting always melts and it's it's just horrible well you learn helpful hints in the classes at least yeah i'm you know the instructor told us certain things about well don't follow what's really necessarily on the box you know if you're making just a cake from a box you know do this cause you know make it a variety oh that that you mean about the mix itself well that helps you know some different hints yeah some different hints you know and the different things the different kinds of frostings you can make you know and i have a book an it and you know all of the different you know decorating tips an things like that yeah so well most frostings are sort of butter cream to aren't they yeah yeah those are those kill me it's like it's like i'm eating sugar but they're good sugar well yeah i suspect that's part of the problem but you know yeah so that's about it yeah i guess so it was it was a pleasure chatting with you yes well have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week okay well it was nice talking to you thank you all righty bye-bye bye-bye  well Kathleen do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system i certainly do i think and what do you think that problem is i think we have a lousy school system and i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we don't train our teachers very well and then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents and then oh we don't uh we put too much uh responsibility on the teachers for things that are really not education they're social services hm that seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before well i as a matter of fact i just finished editing a book on the topic so i have some rather strong opinions that's interesting do you uh yourself and and i'm sure they're colored by what i've edited do you self have children with who are or have been through the public school system yes i do and i was not very happy with the results i see so if you were to improve it what would you do to improve it well i think i would start with uh about with getting rid of about two thirds of the administrators uh-huh and all the auxiliary personnel the school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself right and then i would provide uh use the money that we've been paying them to uh provide some special help in training and particularly uh mentor teachers um-hum to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who may have been at it a long time but have been making the same mistakes for a long time sure sure and then let them try some innovative things and see what works and then uh have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who could benefit from the same sorts of things uh-huh um-hum and then from the parents side have the parents support the school get involved pay attention to what's happening talk to the teachers uh talk to their kids about school and support the institution and a instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the uh the teacher's in the middle um-hum that's uh some pretty good ideas why don't you do something with those well i've done about all i can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people uh-huh well you should uh run for a school board position oh well that i'm not so sure about i've got a lot of things to keep me busy uh-huh that's have you done anything like that anything political well my mother was on the school board um-hum as we were coming up and uh that basically is the extent to which our our family has been directly you know they've always been involved my parents through the the PTA organization and my mother was on the school board for eight years um-hum but uh that was that's the extent of which i guess that's more than than some people less than others that's more than a lot i would uh tend to agree with you that there is a problem the methods of correcting it i haven't thought through it quite to the detail which you have but i believe that there's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of even being a teacher um-hum and if there was a way to through the public mind set that image to be a little higher esteem a little uh uh a little more prestige to being a teacher and with that of course you know you have to pay them a accordingly if we paid them more it would attract more the the higher educated people to to either move into that field or to continue in that field yeah and then if you paid them more you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them i think that's absolutely right they the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you're going to be uh rewarding people who've been doing a lousy job and instead of getting the uh improvement that we want so we'd have to have some way to sure sure uh reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them uh a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money it unfortunately it's a and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible um-hum yeah it's hard to tell as other ones so it's very it's very difficult to say that this teacher is doing a better job than this other one other than i guess how you know how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class you know if there's some gauge that they could make yeah uh also i've always i've thought around about the idea of making teaching and the before you can get a certificate you have a a certain residency period so much like a doctor maybe not the four years definitely but some certain type of of position where you're overseen to begin with yeah now that's a very good suggestion uh just something to i rather than throw someone in into that environment uh you know it yeah i don't think i thought that maybe something student i don't think student teaching is enough i think that at least what i used to observe in student teaching was that uh-huh some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with was thrown into a classroom with a teacher who was harried and overworked and uh had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions right to pay much attention to the student teacher and then the student teacher didn't stay but about six weeks um-hum so there really was no time to try much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the the student teacher improve very much sure there are lots of things that could be done in that line including things like videotaping because it wouldn't be hard sure with all the electronic equipment that's around these days to videotape uh either a master teacher teaching a class so that then students could watch that and uh criticize the methods used and and analyze it figure out what worked and what didn't work um-hum and then also to videotape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance sure sure that's good as a a a teaching aid but more you see these commercials that have Jimmy walking into class late and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who is in New York while Jimmy's in Rome and you know the whole electronic classroom idea um i don't know if i i'm in favor yeah in favor of yeah i think especially in the younger years you need to have more of the the person contact rather than just the fact that your machine being fed information to to learn how to learn i don't think that's going to work yeah well another thing i think would be helpful would be to have some sort of uh say a national curriculum because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for uh curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in Texas and California and then everybody else is stuck with that regardless of what they want to teach huh is that because that's where the two biggest markets are or because it well that's the two states that adopt on a statewide basis i see uh and so it uh i used to work for a textbook publisher and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by Texas then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted in the individual school districts um-hum hum and you know a third of the Texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks sure sure and then the states that either don't adopt on a statewide basis or don't have as many kids just have to follow along and take what Texas gets right like with California is the biggest for elementary schools but Texas uh adopts statewide all the way through the twelfth grade i see well definitely is a a national problem if they need to address yep sure is definitely is and i hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with uh Reagan's uh new education secretary and uh you know trying to do some uh trying to produce some new programs anyway right right well i've enjoyed speaking with you excuse me i have got to go i've got another line calling thanks bye all righty good-bye  uh one more time your name okay Tonya uh-huh Tonya hi Tonya Tonya listen uh there's only one show as far as i'm concerned Star Trek the Next Generation okay you sound like one of my best friends hers hers her heart throb is is Star Trek and all those space movies no i like your pessimism yeah hey have have you watched the the the the the Next Generation um-hum no i haven't i have i've was never really into Star Search well uh well Star Star Search who wants really Star Trek well uh well this is this this cannot be compared to the old Star Trek i mean Star Search Star Trek yeah uh-huh okay is can't be compared at all it is it better in your opinion oh much better um-hum what's better about it uh well it's it's it's it's better put together better better dialogues the the the uh the the stories are a little deeper and and and the the the technology of course that they use is much more believable from a from a scientific aspect also they're they're much more sound about what they say and do um-hum um-hum is it much more believable sounds like i would i would probably like that better then the the old Star oh yeah oh it's got got a lot more credibility than than the others also they they they they touch you know a a a a lot of issues that are are are quite relevant you know okay huh and uh yeah yeah yeah i like it maybe i ought to try it out sometimes uh hey try it out and then then the following nights you can watch Married with Children right you like that show well yeah yeah yeah i like that um i don't watch a whole lot of television but when i do i like just a lot of sitcoms because i look at television myself as kind of a get away so i don't i don't like to watch a lot of serious movies uh not on television anyway uh when i watch TV i like to kind of getaway kind of laugh and that i like i even like to watch the sitcoms yeah well that uh-huh yeah well sure it's a it's a good escape uh-huh right now i'm watching uh The Wonder Years The Wonder Years that's a good show and yeah yeah and i like that because the you kind of get to think along with the characters you know so that's why yeah well uh you you you don't sound old enough no huh-uh to to to go back that far uh i am unfortunately uh so i was there during the sixties and i that that's what i love about the show it uh-huh okay oh back a lot of memories and it's it's it it's amazingly accurate um-hum hum i was going to ask if it if it's accurate for you uh-huh oh yeah yeah it it it it really is yeah because i really can't i guess i can't tell but i i enjoy watching it and i think we learned a lot from it well you know and how it was back back then and you know yes yes well it it it is it it is accurate there's there there is um uh because of you the the latter part of the sixties was totally dominated by Vietnam and uh uh-huh those issues and i mean you know it was it was everywhere and and that is the one thing that i notice they sort of shy away from a little bit right hum i mean they hit it a little it but they don't you know i mean it was in everything at the time i was in college and and it totally dominated college but yeah yeah um-hum right uh at at at one point uh before nineteen what was it i guess it was seventy you know uh when they enacted the the what they called the lottery right system of the draft in which um you know uh uh everyone's everyone's birthday was chosen it was chosen at random and and only the first third of those were taken and and and would be inducted into the you know Army the Army was the only one accepting toward the end um-hum right right and so um you know it it it it really was terrible because uh until until that it least every one was going crazy at least when they inducted uh they they did the lottery only only one third of the people were going crazy because um-hum right right they were going to go have to go and it was a war that was really quite unpopular but um-hum um-hum it was kind of crazy yeah unlike this war that we just got out of here yeah anyway so so but but they they should uh uh you you you you know i think maybe maybe hit that a little heavier on that show what other shows you watch yeah yeah um i like the Thursday night lineup on NBC the Cosby Show A Different World Cheers i really like Cheers and uh even yeah yeah yeah Cheers i i used to like the Cosby Show i've kind of gotten burned out on that though yeah i'm kind of getting burned out but i still watch it i guess just for the heck of it because i've been watching it uh yeah yeah um i like Evening Shade a lot of the new yeah i've got a friend that keeps threatening to kill me if i don't watch Evening Shade yeah that's a really good show that's a really good show she says that it's it's a really good show so i'm going to have to check it out and uh Designing Designing Women i like that a lot uh-huh yeah uh so do i yeah i like a lot of the newer a lot of the newer shows i like um there's yeah i i i i i was really glad to hear that they were finally taking that dinosaur off what Dallas did it's last show oh yes that was Friday in fact i went to a last episode of Dallas party yes at a friend's house and we just all got together and watched the last episode although although we didn't although we hadn't watched it in years you know yeah it really was everyone was pre tty disappointed in the ending oh they yeah i hear it was the dog of a show oh well go out with a whimper so yeah exactly uh i guess that's the way to go what else do you watch besides Star Trek oh do is there anything else on no no i i uh i watch a lot of i've got cable here so i don't watch a lot of network stuff yeah uh-huh i i mean you know the typical three networks i um i do watch a lot of CNN stuff and and uh uh i'm home most of the time so right yeah yeah i find myself watching a lot of CNN i like they have a fashion show on CNN that i like to watch huh yeah i i got really uh i mean i i i watched it a lot before the the the Saudi crisis but after that uh it just seemed like it it became apart of my every day viewing uh-huh right you feel like you really don't know what's going on unless you tune in at least for you know fifteen minutes or so and yeah and and that's what i like about it i can tune in any time uh-huh right and get the all all the days events uh-huh and get all the yeah i don't have to you know uh view it at at a certain time of day i can i can check it out anytime generally and uh and find out what's going on and i like that i right right yeah i remember i remember when Turner started that thing they said that it would never fly and for the first year or two it really it really uh-huh sort of wallowed but uh yeah and and if you know notice i mean it's gone so far in the with just with just with this well the thing is is that that the world finds out most i mean like you know it was interesting uh like during the Saudi crisis the people here were finding out uh-huh uh-huh about more what was happening by watching CNN than they were getting i mean the military folks even um-hum right and the the networks themselves were depending on CNN so oh exactly for a lot of things you know they would make they would even mention CNN and have their footage on and everything exactly yeah yeah so it it it it really has become sort of like the world's eye so their going to become right exactly uh and and i you know it was a it was an idea whose time had come that Turner's quite a character um-hum um um-hum Ted Turner yeah anyway i really enjoy i really enjoy having access to that all the time yeah yeah i'll turn to it just every now and then and you know yeah yeah so you guys are you you you evidently have access to the cable too yes uh-huh yeah well good i don't think i don't didn't didn't know if they had cable in Waco yeah we're we're up there we're trying to become technologically sound here so are you going to school there no i work here i'm a news reporter as a matter fact but yeah so speaking of news uh oh really oh well well indeed well that's but uh yeah i'm i'm not in Waco by choice i just i have to work here because it's my it's my first job so really uh and Baylor University is here so that's i i'm sure no one is oh yeah yeah well now now now that that's a a very you know that that that's a good thing in Waco's favor Baylor is is uh-huh yeah it's pretty much the outline i mean it's really a college town Baylor's it for Waco Waco you know yeah well Baylor's Baylor's a well known university i mean it really is yeah uh-huh i went to the University of Texas in Austin which is not not far away oh from here well i hailed from Arizona State ooh i started to go to Berkeley yeah or i i applied or something i Cal's a great great great school it really is yeah yeah i want to come visit California at some point you've never been but no i never have uh i know i know i i grew up in New York you must you must it's a it oh my goodness so you know i just i i haven't got oh well i grew up in North Carolina and it's a great used to be from my mother grew up in what part of North Carolina in in Raleigh Raleigh okay my mother grew up in Whitefield yeah well listen dear i guess we've strayed from the TV thing but pleasure talking to you okay it was nice talking to you too have fun in Berkeley okay okay okay bye-bye all right Tonya you take it yeah yeah do come check it out all right bye-bye  well do you think we're paying too much in taxes right now well frankly i think we're paying too little i think we have paid too little since Reagan and them decided to cut it uh i used to get these uh surveys from the Republican Party from time to time asking if i thought it was a good idea for them to cut taxes and i kept saying no i felt like what we ought to do is cut spending and keep taxes the way they were well granted maybe the only way they could keep the spending to be uh that is curtail the spending and cut it was to cut taxes forcing spending to have to be cut but uh i always felt like the Congress uh just ought to shoulder responsibilities of biting the bullet uh that they uh uh are are supposed to be able to uh you know handle shoulder yeah and uh cut their spending and if they had uh done that without cutting taxes we wouldn't find ourselves in economic quagmire we're in now yeah well i think too many people are not paying enough taxes some are paying too much uh the the middle class but the uh upper class the wealthy people are not paying enough uh-huh i think the legislation that there ought to be legislation that make makes it more equitable for uh depending on how much you earn are you so you like the progressive income tax yeah i sure do uh-huh i we think everybody ought to be paying their fair share there still too many loopholes available to to get by with well well i i thought they had closed most of the uh loopholes when they came out with this uh pretty well constant fixed tax type uh about the only well i know there are a few you're right about that but primarily the only thing that was supposed to be any longer tax deductible was your your first and second home mortgages the interest that is yeah right and that was about it now i think there are still some real estate oriented type tax hedges they cut it back on rental property income yeah that uh you can't uh get uh tax deductions on uh say a second third fourth house that you own on paying uh taxes on on that yeah well that's where the rich see uh certainly have a second third fourth and fifth house right and they also cut back on things like limited partnerships right uh in what way what loopholes then are are left that you're talking about well the maximum tax bracket is twenty eight percent right well thirty three if you're in that hump but so nobody can pay any higher than right yeah but uh uh uh i i felt like they ought to cut the capital gains tax i think that's right too i agree with that because it it for for once finally with taxes having been cut it makes the little investor like myself capable if you're able to set aside a little money aside to do a little investing and make a few bucks without getting it all taken away from you sure and you ought to get your salary taxed once and if you're able to save some money to be able to invest in stocks and bonds and various things like that then to get it stuck to you again seems just a little bit unfair right i'm saying the way our taxes are structured right now it does not encourage saving no it really doesn't but on the other hand how how um how would we change it to encourage saving um well that that's a good question and go back to things like tax free IRAs and like that they wound up coming back yeah i agree with that that that's i uh okay yeah i thought that was a good move too that certainly in yeah i think i wish we would do that i'm in a bracket right now where i cannot take advantage of an IRA getting a tax deduction on it i hear you i used to be able to do that but uh i can't now and so then there's also the problem now where i've got some contributions that were tax deductible and some that aren't and i have to keep those separate yeah and now that right yeah and that's absolutely unfair i agree and it seems like every time Congress and and and uh the presidency gets a set up like the had now see that's the kind of tax cuts i'm for not necessarily just a a broad range tax cut on salaries so much but tax cuts where they don't tax savings of various kinds you know savings where you're willing to tie your money up at least some minimum period of time some some uh minimum number of years and all like like IRAs were uh it it that that those are reasonable alternatives that the average person can get in on and not just the rich alone yeah but uh uh seems like every time that uh people begin to make a little money at that and a lot of people jumped on IRAs i mean you did you apparently you apparently did and a lot of people i know did too oh i still do contribute to an IRA even though i can't take advantage of any tax breaks yeah yeah well i'm in one too but it seems like as soon as they uh got to going like gangbusters and the Congress saw that big pile of money beginning to form out there they wanted to come in and tax it again sure and and uh that that's only again because they would not uh uh police themselves and their spending uh-huh and i i don't know i i don't know what else to do about it i mean seems like we are are are constantly reelecting Republican presidents and Democratic Congresses or Democratic presidents and Republican Congresses and they can't ever seem to get together yeah well i think one of the things that may maybe does encourage encourage uh saving in a small way is that you can't write off taxes on personal spending uh that may keep a again that may cause a recession as well though because it keeps people from going going out and charging their credit cards uh to the max right and it cuts down on uh how much uh spending were their going to uh do for the year do you think this latest interest cut rate cut that the Fed just went through is going to uh get people back on the spending i'm not so sure about that uh we're still uh in a recession as such and uh it that tax that cut in the in the the prime has not encouraged activity in the market yet yeah uh-huh uh-huh i think people are going to follow the stock market if if it takes off uh that's a good indicator that the economy is turning around and people are going to start spending again right now a lot of people are fearful about their jobs well oh yeah i know exactly how you feel there are a lot of layoffs uh you know unemployment's way up and uh they're just saving money uh until things get better right uh-huh uh-huh i uh was talking to a fellow today and he seemed to think it was going to make a difference but i said hey if a lot of people are all ready borrowed up to the hilt i don't care how cut low you cut taxes they can't afford to borrow anymore or they won't just because they want to try to get a handle on what they have that you you've got to cut them drastically such that the uh idea of refinancing at a lower interest rate becomes the thing to do right well you can do that with say a mortgage payment but they charge so many points in order to refinance a lot of people can't afford that yeah and that's right or or less the break is considerable between the the interest rates and the cut between say eleven percent mortgage down to no more than nine percent mortgage that's not enough you've got to get down to eight maybe even seven and a half yeah well that's basically what we're doing right now is uh people a lot of people have eleven percent mortgages and they can get nine percent now but it costs them three points to do that yeah and that's not enough you need a eight percent loan to be able to do that three percent of yeah three percent of their mortgage mortgage right now or or of the uh principal that's left on their loan is uh a significant chunk of change that's right and uh a lot of people aren't aren't in a position to take advantage of that so i i i'm not so sure myself that uh that cutting interest rates is going to do it or cutting taxes either i just think we've gotten ourselves so uh gone through such a uh uh period of time where we've been so credit hungry and um we have gotten uh u h so out on a limb in debt not only uh federal debt but consumer debt too that uh i'm really concerned whether any kind of taxation one way or the other is going to make a difference yeah well another thing that uh kind of irks me right now is i just got my tax appraisal on my house and it went up ten thousand dollars from last year uh uh-huh well you know that's what's happened to me i got my appraisal well we get them up here they give them to you three years out there's uh-huh i mean you you get one every year but it it it puts in at a what they expect it to be for the next three years you know based on what it is right now subject to change of course right and uh real estate values up here in in the uh uh uh eastern corridor have dropped about two and a half to five percent real estate values here have dropped at least ten percent over the past uh two years okay well see the pressure's is more up here so it hasn't dropped quite as bad because the population being what it is but nevertheless it's dropped right but uh this hasn't been reflected in my appraisals and i was just telling my wife the other night you know i says i i wonder who it is you talk to here in the state about about protesting this because if and only uh interest rates i'm sorry uh property values don't come back up which means i can see that i can uh get again at least what i could have gotten for my house a year ago then i'm not being fairly appraised right there's no justification here for an increase in uh the value of a home the property values are still going down and i'm not sure they've hit the bottom yet um in the Texas area so uh when when they yes when they all of a sudden increase with all the layoffs and what not uh real estate prices have not been going up uh-huh ha uh there's too many too many homes on the market right now too many people are just bailing out on their homes and leaving them their abandoning abandoning their homes uh-huh is a lot of that going on oh yes there's two homes on my street right now that sure um that's going to put the banks in dire straights because the banks don't want the property they want the money that's right there are a lot of banks that are in trouble we've had banks that have been closing for the past two years in Texas we've got a record number of banks that have been gone all ready gone under yeah well do you see where the tax situation could really help that any uh no i don't i think that's mostly with the economy and the job market uh-huh but i think it's unfair that uh the tax appraisal has gone up this year when in fact the uh the value of the homes has not oh i do too yeah yeah i think it's absolutely unfair but they've gotten into this mentality and uh i don't think they know how to appraise a house down yeah i don't know how what they use to justify that uh because say i've got the same model home as some of my neighbors and they're all appraised at the same level yeah yeah even though i've made more improvements on my house than somebody else has and nobody comes out to take a look and see what you've done to get a proper appraisal now out here they do they take pictures of house and everything and what they do is they look at what your particular model at least three of them have sold for within the last twelve months or later if if they have the data they don't always have that much data because they may not have sold that many of your model okay uh-huh but here they could for instance i i've had to they do it randomly more or less but they try to get three at a time over a twelve month period because uh one of the houses i sold i'm in my third house now i uh my second house i actually had an appraiser come out and take pictures of it uh that he had to go  okay sorry wow that's okay so tell me about your home oh it's uh it looks like a little shot gun house almost it's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other um-hum it's uh an older home it's not new i like it though it's big oh really what kind of square footage oh i wouldn't know i measured it one time because i was uh we had saw some termites and we thought about getting it sprayed i think it was like i can't remember i'm sorry that's okay that's okay it's big enough for us though we kind of need maybe one more room we've got two children uh-huh uh-huh okay so where do you live at i mean what what part of town in here in Dennison okay let's see that's north or down here in Dennison yeah okay i live i live in Plano so it's north to me okay up here then i say down i'm really from Kentucky i was going to say you didn't have the typical you have a southern accent but you don't have a Texas accent uh-huh right well i'm originally from uh Ohio Cincinnati so i'm familiar uh familiar with uh oh okay that area that dialect right right also i lived in Georgia for about four years so the uh there's a difference too between east and west in the south uh-huh and uh the way in which people speak anyway my home is um i guess it's about twenty five hundred square foot and i have uh four bedrooms at the present we're busting out walls and things like that that's what i want to do how many kids do you have we have two do you have enough bedroom space then we have two yeah we'll have enough bedroom space it's we're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small uh-huh and so we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit that's kind of like what we would like to do we just had a baby a couple months ago and we've got a den that's more or less a spare room we rarely go in there except for to play chess um-hum um-hum we want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter and uh um-hum we need the one extra room like like i said our rooms are too small the bedrooms are too small the living room and kitchen are huge but the bedrooms are too small where you've got to right leave the furniture just one certain way you can't rearrange it at all right there's they uh i know what you're saying there ours is the same and they tend to put windows in the strangest places yeah You know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for yeah we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom um-hum you you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything so uh-huh no privacy uh no we don't have a lot of that yeah well we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house it um-hum i'd hate to clean these windows i really would i figured i'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean ours are the double pane and you can't really clean them on the inside ours are those too yeah you must live in an older home too then you know right i do the house is about um i'd say almost thirty years old uh-huh so it's not a new home it's it's seen some wear and tear ours has too now when we moved in the man that sold it to us had said he had remodeled it you know um-hum and he did it hisself so most of that by now is falling apart oh you know well i mean it's not just horrible but like this tiles come loose off the wall the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile and i don't like that at all um oh that is awful with that uh the great big tiles square tiles like that you put on the floor uh-huh he did it in that the the huge one yeah instead of wallpaper i wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles for that the normal tiles right you put right that you put around a bathtub that would be prettier um-hum but this looks like floor covering on the wall it just doesn't look good oh and also they're very heavy and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier right there's one big one that has come off and short of putting nails through it we can't get it back on um so and he rewired the house and it's shorting out here and there and oh wow i that's one of the things we've been fortunate with is our wiring been okay we don't have a we don't have enough power uh-huh um our our breakers aren't aren't powerful enough to take to to really help with the load in the house i mean we need to redo some rewiring ourselves but our plumbing is awful there is nothing there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work uh-huh um and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house so if something breaks we have to shut it off from the main in the street you know and oh it's it can be really bizarre and we never know where it's going to flood yeah yeah we've got power surges on the west side of our house we've got our stereo hooked up um-hum well that the power makes it run it's never ran it's always ran just fine the clock and stuff but it runs about ten minutes fast except for about a month for about a month the the clock ran normal um-hum um and then the power went off again lightning or something knocked it out and we hooked it back up and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again but on the east side of the house it runs fine um oh boy you do have a strange wiring problem there he put new wiring in it's all new wiring up in the attic or i guess crawl space um-hum uh-huh but uh oh no he didn't know what he was doing he really should have hired people well that's something my husband's in construction and he won't even touch electrical stuff he i i mean he'll do a little minimal things but he won't do any major rewiring he says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it right he'll end up killing himself pardon end up killing theirselves that's right my husband he'll change out a light switch but that's about as far as he'll go well that's the way mine is you know i mean he he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around and he was like yeah oh my God he says looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there and we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry uh was a what the roof was really sorry i mean when we moved in we had no idea how bad it was it was a wood shingle roof and we the first year we were living there we had to replace the roof uh-huh well he put which i heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles is it three or five your husband probably knows he probably knows i don't know what it is off hand well he's got seven layers of shingles up there and he told us it was a completely new roof like i said he didn't know what he was doing yeah he must not of we stripped ours we stripped ours off we didn't put it over because we put composition roof on and we completely stripped completely stripped all the old wood shingles off put decking up um-hum put the paper down and i mean just started from scratch unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain and we and we had we had almost i'd say about half of the roof off uh-huh oh no and uh uh a house full of snow and it did this and a house full of snow and rain and it came down it did this in the middle of the night we have plastic you know just tied down on everything you know as best we could real thick gauge stuff i mean and the wind came in from the north and just blew everything off in the middle of the night and we were asleep and and i woke up and i got up and it was about four o'clock in the morning and i heard all these these drips drip drip drip drip drip drip oh no i had water coming in every light fixture that's yeah i had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling everywhere and i mean it filled up my light fixtures because they're the old kind uh-huh and i would go in and i'd turn on a light in the room you know and the light would come on and the whole thing would be full of water and i mean the light would still come on it didn't blow up or anything my neighbor or a friend of mine when i lived in Louisiana her we all lived on base my husband was in the Army uh-huh she woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning water dripping from hers the neighbor's uh washing machine had uh overdone something i don't know but it was leaking just pouring water and it all went through to her roof and it was coming out of the lights fixtures oh the fire alarm went off for some reason it shorted it out or something so she woke up with about six oh yeah that'll happen feet of water in her house oh my Lord no not six feet but but it's quite a bit quite a bit you know that yeah you might as well so did you have carpets and stuff oh several of our rooms got ruined we have um we have are on pier and beam we don't have concrete slab underneath our house um-hum so it it got into the carpeting got into the floor the carpeting was already awful anyway but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink so your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too oh really yeah yeah they came in and they had it one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it we had to call the insurance company i mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof roof was being repaired uh-huh you know which really wasn't our fault i mean we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather that's right right you know and stuff and well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in are you finished with it now oh yeah it it uh the roof oh yeah yeah it's it's been done for quite some time we're really glad with all the rain we've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof uh-huh uh-huh how long have you lived there uh see it's three it's just been at at three years we've been in the house just the three years we've been doing a lot of remodeling i mean it's it had a detached it had a drive detached garage and my husband's built a walkway across and we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that so we you all did it yourselves what uh the walk the home improvements oh yeah yeah he see he does this for a living i mean this is what uh-huh  yeah so um what do you feel about the universal health insurance issue well well i'm i'm not really very much in favor of it at all uh i i feel like uh the the government gets involved in in a little bit too much of our life anyway and health insurance is is one thing that i'm i'm not sure that they have the expertise to to run it anyway and i i just kind i kind of feel like like i say we've got too much government already um-hum i guess my my initial reaction would be that that i would be for it mainly from the standpoint that that i find um my health insurance not very effective and very expensive um-hum yeah and so i you know am am probably being very naive i'm hoping that that by by centralizing it it might get better and be cheaper yeah well i guess i i i i guess my my my my own opinion of of uh government programs in general especially those that are centralized type you know centralizing type of programs i have not seen one yet that that that i i felt like really worked the way it should i think that uh the private sector has uh a lot more expertise available and has the incentives to make a program work whereas a a bureaucracy uh people that work in in a bureaucracy are just there to keep the bureaucracy going um-hum so uh i'm what about uh things like in Sweden isn't isn't that sort of a centralized or in lots of places in Europe yeah well i guess uh uh like i said i i i don't really know that much about it i i've uh uh mine may be more prejudice than opinion you know i i guess i've got uh uh prejudice against the government you you know uh um-hum um-hum i i feel like i feel like too much government is too much government right i you know i guess i can certainly agree with that but um you know like i said i feel i'm being uh being stung every time yeah yeah i i know that uh the British like i say i know i understand that the British system uh which is you know centralized medical program does not work very well or at least the people are not real real happy with it oh i see and and uh i i that's my understanding anyway um-hum um-hum yeah i knew they had one but i just i guess i assumed it worked which is is uh not a good and uh you know yeah yeah you know when when you when you read uh uh uh see the some of the articles or or watch in particular watch some of the British made television shows you get the impression that it's it's more or less a joke uh you know a lot of people use it because they don't have an alternative uh an affordable affordable alternative um-hum um-hum but they're you know they still it doesn't work very well i know in here in Texas in in the Dallas area we have a uh a county run hospital um-hum you know the county furnishes the hospital and people that don't have uh access to to insurance and stuff are able to go to that hospital but if you go there if you're you know if you've got an emergency you have to be almost dead before you can get in like you know in a timely manner because there are so many people sitting there waiting all the time uh-huh uh-huh for medical services that you know if you may be there five or six hours you know for just normal treatment um-hum um-hum and and i guess i'm not uh i'm not too keen on having to go to a to a some kind of a location like that on on a routine basis right um-hum maybe i don't know much about HMO's but my impression is maybe maybe some uh HMO's are sort of a low form of centralization well i guess uh to some extent uh an HMO i i have been involved have have been a member of an HMO before for a short period of time and and that did work very well um-hum but it was you know the company it was a company sponsored plan and and it it is you know individual doctors that do own or have a you know have a a shareholders in an HMO um um-hum and uh so it's not i i guess uh it's not a it's not a government run operation and that's that's you know that's my main objection i you know i don't care how they finance it right um-hum you know they could they could put a tax on me and say this is for medical insurance and then hire a you know some kind of private company that's not run by a government to you know to run the program um-hum and and that might work but if it's if it's going to be run you know and supervised at at at a government level by a bureaucratic type you know operation um-hum uh i don't think it's going to work myself um-hum i do i do think that we're headed that way i think that there's a strong possibility that in in my lifetime i will see uh you know see one in operation so um-hum is that because of of the the cost or or government wants it you think well i think i think that uh i think there only that want it uh um-hum and i think the government will respond you know to when i say a lot of people i'm not saying a majority of people but i think the government will respond to that group that does want it um-hum um-hum you know so you know you know i guess i i well i'm a i'm a pessimist in that in that respect well but that's interesting because you know it's it's i don't know that much about it but my initial response would be more favorable and and perhaps i need to to learn more about it so that i'm not so naive on it yeah yeah well i guess and and and and perhaps mine too you know perhaps i i need to know have stronger arguments for why are are or find out the the arguments in favor of you know so but uh uh-huh but that's i guess that's i had not thought about before so right well it was nice talking to you okay okay um um-hum bye-bye yeah it was nice talking to you too okay thanks bye  um basically i'm at home and i have two cats and my husband i mean my husband's great uh-huh oh uh-huh yeah it's wonderful you know and and uh so i'm about forty and whatever uh-huh so yeah around there huh well you're you're just a youngster then i passed the fifty yeah i'm just a spring chicken i guess so i guess our topic's going to be changes in the women's roles so it should be real interesting well right oh so you think we're ready i think i'm ready okay okay uh you want to start off well let's see the changes i've seen in women's roles uh since i am in the forty age i'm a fifties baby um um-hum and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very very wide um it's been a big change um very much yeah yeah yes very much and i think you'll have to agree and since we were in uh sort of the ground level the bra burning of the sixties and and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be um-hum um-hum um-hum um and i think you know it got off to a really radical it has a radical fringe to it that um i've sort of backed away from i think all things get started sometimes in that manner yeah you know they come in that way and to make a change you know you have to make a splash but um-hum um-hum to continue in that vein i think it got a little bit warped and off the track in several areas but i really do think that women have made a contribution um-hum um-hum um to human beings i mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions and it's okay and i think um you know on the other hand i don't know that men have changed that much so in in contrast to the women's changes um you know the men stay steady and then the women change around them um-hum i hadn't thought much about that but that is true um i think men are trying that's uh-huh some of them but they don't have a national organization of men to uh help them out and um what's changing them though is the economic situation where both no no um very much team it has to be a team partnership now and they both have to work um-hum um-hum and they both have to raise the children if we're going to have any kind of future at all and and that i think has been the downfall of the last ten years you know the me um-hum um-hum um-hum oh i don't know the the yuppiedom the whatever it was the hum you know women didn't know how to go about doing the careers and they wanted to compete with men they wanted to be like men and that's wrong i think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men men um-hum yeah not no they they hurt themselves a little bit in that way um absolutely and so that's you know they sort of threw the thing back another you know ten years that they've had to you know restructure but i saw the greatest T-shirt the other day i got to get some for all my men friends it says let men run the world women have more important things to do um-hum there you go there's a lot of truth in that yeah right but um i think men and women both have valuable valuable assets to offer um-hum and you know we shouldn't we were made differently however you come to that conclusion we were that's right biologically physiologically made differently and there is great wonderment in that and uh you know we should respect that in each other so um-hum yes it shouldn't be destroyed yeah yeah right and and you know just sort of all swooshed swooshed into one channel sort of thing it's um-hum um-hum it's viva la difference someone said that and and i think that you can truly respect the other person i mean you know Tom is just always saying what a mystery you are you know depends on yeah yeah yeah well that's kind of makes it exciting you know yeah well see that depends on what day of the month it is yeah but um i don't know i guess we've gotten more of a in in terms of that i think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles and but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles um-hum well i think now when both are working they have a more chance more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way yeah well that's that's a very different way to do things you know the woman doesn't start off at home raising the kids and goes back into her career you know twenty years later yeah right right yeah um because you get set in your ways and it's really hard to to really to get help you do yeah uh did you know to get the work load shared are are you married yes uh-huh our i we have five children they're they're all grown and on their own so do you have children oh my goodness oh my they're uh how did you do uh how do you mean that well i mean okay well did you have boys girls how did uh we have uh two girls and three boys and our our baby girl just had a baby girl how oh my oh my last week was her first baby o h how exciting so it's been real exciting i i tell you what i don't know what i would do without my friends having all their kids i just love the babies and and since i'm sort of in a medical situation where i can't do that it's um-hum um-hum yeah have you been that way long just eight years just the most important years of my life you know eight just eight years that's that's a long eight years though yeah it has been and um so there have been major major adjustments but that's another story but you know my husband has really really uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh filled in the gaps i mean i that makes a big difference i couldn't ask for a better life i mean if this is the way it had to be this is the best way i could possibly do it and and that has a lot to do with his strength and his uh-huh um-hum um-hum just pitching in and and his being able to you know all all ego aside do a lot of things that really uh-huh uh-huh so when i say men haven't changed i guess i should look at my own backyard sort of thing and yeah well probably your role and and the way you are also has changed though you know compared to what it would have been like say twenty fifty years ago oh yeah yeah that's true i mean boy i mean i i would have had so i had so much guilt to begin with and the changes that had to take place hm um-hum um-hum you know where i couldn't do a lot of things and um just adjusting to that that um yeah that was a major change but so i guess um-hum um um in the end you know you each take your own situation and you and you deal with it the best you can but the best you can yes but but women i think are a whole you know sort of riding the course they're they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there i think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation i yeah that's the only thing i worry about is the the child's love and security that i think that's being damaged um i think we're going to see a generation of kids that you know are just going to be a little bit um oh not very nurturing i think a lot um-hum i do too i i think uh now some some women can can do both they're very capable of working and and yeah but i wish they weren't so many i i wish they weren't role models for everybody because it's so dangerous a um-hum um-hum it it really is yeah it's dangerous for the woman too to think that she can do that and then when she can't you know the failure of that is um-hum you know her life sort of falls apart and she doesn't know who she is and she's so many have to work to make a go of it it seems or they say they do anyways and eh but i think ones that don't have to the it's not as much of a stigma not absolutely to work as it was for a while there well you know i think that's that's really i think it depends on what part of the country you're in well that could be um i i would almost just say that because you know down here in the south you know a woman's role is a woman's role sort of thing and you know um-hum um-hum oh yeah yeah you mean it's stronger there um oh yeah yeah and and i think that um much stronger yeah you know career woman still have a lot of problems here with the good old boys here in Texas sort of thing making career moves but yeah yeah right right right um you know in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents um it's just like the way it it has been for years i mean you know um-hum since the days of the pioneers around here that's the woman's role and it and it's hard for her to um you know amongst her peers yeah yeah yeah be appreciated i think sometimes but then i'm not there so i don't know that yeah yeah and i have women that do both and i see a little jealousy on the part of you know the woman what has two little boys and and she has an au pair which is a live in college kid working for her and then she has her business in the back ah and then my other girlfriend that has you know just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy all the time uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and so i see i little bit of that and i always wish there was a balance you know with the one and and wish she could spend more time with her kids and the other gal i wish she could just get out of Dodge for a while and get some peace and quiet um um right but but they're both yeah they're both different people too that's yeah definitely so you're right about that yeah that's where the trouble lies some people some people can adjust and have both do both well and others can't and that's that's true that's so true how how did your daughter do it uh well uh i have one daughter that works full-time she has two little boys uh-huh and they seem to do fine she has been talking has talked about quitting you know and staying home for a few years but then it's real hard because she's got an excellent job uh right  it seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution yeah and i can very clearly remember ten years ago i was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and and exploring trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful and we did end up with uh IBM PCs which i now would not have chosen but that was before the Macintosh really yeah and twenty years ago i was uh in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on on a manual typewriter oh i know it so i would say that's one of the largest changes in at least in my life yeah i've i've seen that just in the last um even five years how much they've increased uh increased in use or probably eight years when i was a freshman in college uh-huh uh my degree was in computer uh technology originally and it seemed like it would they were just getting out with the you know the disks and all that getting away with the cards um-hum you know doing away with the the programming cards and uh right yeah thirty years ago i i had a college job uh working as a programmer and we had to write code in binary and uh have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which i don't think exist anymore you never see one of those punch cards anymore i know no um i think TV has a lot to do with the changes too don't you in like people's attitudes well very possibly uh i'm not sure in the last ten years it's been very different from before uh certainly in the last thirty i would say there have been significant changes even even the change from black and white to color television thirty years ago i guess there were color TVs but i sure didn't have access to one yeah oh and uh by twenty years ago practically everybody had a color TV and now i think they're as almost as many well there are more TVs than households so yeah it's close to getting uh one TV per person they say and now everybody uh has VCRs and two or three VCRs um-hum and that kind of thing yeah certainly ten years ago uh VCRs were just coming on the market so that's made a significant difference in the way i watch television for instance because uh now i almost never watch a TV program when it's on yeah i know i tape it and then watch it when it's convenient and that way i don't have to worry about being interrupted i can just put it on pause yeah and you can you can flip through the commercials so you don't have to watch the commercials right yeah that's always hassle convenient um-hum yes you can watch a program in forty five minutes instead of an hour you skip the commercials uh-huh so what was their question about decline in sociological wasn't the decline so much i think they just said the changes in uh social social changes in the United States yeah how was life different ten twenty or thirty years ago so well it i can't really remember back that far but ten years ago um i don't know i'd say like in the nineteen seventies you remember how kids would walk around with AM what do you call those little AM radios and now people have jam box with CD players in them you know yes yes that's certainly a difference and hand held TVs and car phones yeah that's another one yeah car phones is a good point and uh cellular phones of all types and beepers uh ten years ago i was working in a job at a medical center and i had to carry a beeper around and they were yeah kind of bulky and all they did was just uh make a beep noise and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call uh-huh these days they have these tiny little things that are only about the size of two or three pencils and they fit in your shirt pocket and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a a phone number to respond to and those are cool yeah those are pretty neat and they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off in a theatre or something and you can still get your messages yeah yeah but let's see social changes uh where do you think it's where do you think it's going to go in twenty years i haven't the slightest idea i was just thinking though about a a a huge social change in the last ten years is AIDS yeah it was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago i i know that because i was writing a a paper about it um-hum i was writing a a journal article uh and they still didn't even know what caused it or anything uh there was a suspicion that it was a virus but nobody had identified it and they were really just going on epidemiological uh wow um-hum uh guesswork uh because the way it was transmitted made it look an awful lot like uh hepatitis and then yeah from from the spread pattern of hepatitis they could work backwards to the transmission by uh blood and semen and then i i'm curious what was your uh graduate study in well i was i was in English as a matter of fact and medieval studies oh wow uh-huh uh but i went to work as an editor and writer so uh uh uh uh ten years ago i was working in the medical center uh publishing a journal and writing about medical topics yeah and let's see twenty years ago i guess we're were just beginning to get into what they were calling the uh the sex revolution where uh after the pill and uh uh yeah freed people up from worries about uh illegitimate pregnancy and i guess in the seventies is the the time when that was supposed to have exploded thirty years ago there was no pill um-hum do you think that's caused a lot of pressure on like younger kids today to make choices that they probably shouldn't have to make yep i do i really do i have uh yeah four kids in college right now children and stepchildren and i know that the expectation for them was uh to have sex and uh much earlier than the expectation when i was in college um-hum in my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be sleeping with their boyfriends yeah yeah yeah but they certainly didn't expect everybody to and it was really only uh acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in in the relatively near future um-hum and i certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays oh yeah it's kind of scary when i think of what will happen in twenty years you know when i have kids and they're grown and um just kind of some of the changes that will happen even more so seems like it can't get much worse and i guess the answer is is stay flexible because nobody can predict what's going to happen in twenty years i certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what uh my kids were likely to be like course one of them was just a a an yeah a brand new baby twenty years ago so i sure wouldn't have been able to predict um-hum for him hm and some of the other ones weren't born yeah so sounds like America's going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and yeah worldwide communication and electronic mail i just got on that this past about a year ago and that's made a difference in the way i do my job because it's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things yeah even when they're another on another continent yeah it's pretty wild yeah and even you know that reminds me Federal Express was around ten years ago but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency uh-huh and nowadays people use Fed Ex all the time yeah sure do huh people do seem to travel more it's much more common for people even teenagers to be going to Europe and South America and Asia uh yeah i was almost thirty before i got off this continent and uh both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school yeah yeah i know that's what uh what my family was talking when i picked up and moved to Texas from Indiana and they were like well you know twenty thirty years ago we wouldn't have done that you know um-hum and uh especially come home every couple months yeah you know and  okay uh as far as you know crime in the cities i'm sure it like in yours it's pretty pretty bad uh probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have how about you um-hum uh well i don't actually live in the city but uh i'd probably say that's roughly right i mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life but i i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution um and sale of drugs um-hum probably probably right if you look at it from that stand point um-hum what uh is there anything that uh that you particularly are concerned with in in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing uh where i live no it's it's not so bad i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it um but i do have friends who live in the city and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing um just because there are like crack houses you know on their street and stuff like this um-hum do you live in a real small town or or out in the country i live out in the country yeah how far out from the city i mean do you i am about fifteen miles out about fifteen miles i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so um-hum but it's pretty congested we are considered in the country but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country our major crimes in our immediate hm hm town uh is probably robberies house robberies um-hum and very few instances of you know alcohol drug uh reported however i'm sure they're there um-hum but uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their their uh existence in that neighborhood wow that's huge and since that time everybody's gotten some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms um-hum uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices the sensors and things like that it's cut back um-hum you know considerably but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to another neighborhood so it still uh remains city wide pretty pretty high are they are there any theories on why this is happening uh i would say the majority of it's happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon um-hum but why why is it happening most well most families most families they are young and both people are working so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work uh so uh um-hum um-hum i would say that's probably their prime motivation they'll stalk they'll stalk your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there so they're professionals um they classify most of them as professionals uh you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick hm um-hum probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles Mercedes Volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for uh jewelry um-hum are the major targets guns that sort of stuff hm very few you know penny penny ante stuff well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime well uh the police force for one i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use uh it's oh right now i think we're about thirty thousand people and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many and um-hum um-hum right but that mean that's gonna tend to i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher in other words you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place well the course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever so they're giving the early release uh right they're doing that in our state too yeah and and it's i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences uh but for the that would be certainly be a deterrent so you think that would be a deterrent um-hum and uh not necessarily you know uh give in to their uh human rights desires you know if they're overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate uh well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty uh i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty you know in a lot of cases course i i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof uh right so you'd you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody i'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh um-hum um-hum to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and follow-through with that uh hm especially you you know in the case of murder uh i know in my case i had my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty five and we caught the individuals got caught we uh right oh wow oh my goodness um-hum we went through the court system and all that sort of thing and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the the forty five to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards um-hum right uh you know the the guy only got five years and you know he was out within two months because of the parole system so what what wow did you did you sue him under the civil system do what now did you sue him under the civil system no no i'm not real familiar with that well you probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him and oh well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him and they said well you know he they're he has no job he has nothing there's nothing that he has that that you could go after yeah makes you wish they had uh still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing yeah uh very seldom but they give give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt yeah they don't do that here course they pay them but they don't you don't you or the insurance companies never see any of that money yeah that's too bad and uh you know and they're right now they're reluctant to go after them because they're you know they're they're repeat offenders they uh they've bee n in jail before they've been released you know several times which is another um-hum um-hum um-hum uh deal i hate to see but uh you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and uh and car theft on top of it and destroys my car he we're out you know uh you know um-hum yeah i i think that's a yeah yeah that's awful fifteen thousand dollars and you know the guy gets out in two months and he goes out and commits it again fact he's back in jail now so what what uh gives you sympathy for the vigilantes just yeah what what deterrent does he really have yeah and i think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real real possibility uh we've had a couple instances where break-ins where the the people have actually you know um-hum shot the people and uh return offenders have oh my God and uh return offenders have they've actually waited for them where they've robbed you know particular neighborhood they'll rob one house then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else and try to take it in their own hands course it doesn't always work out in their favor hm right but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you can't arrest all of us you can you know you can get some of us you can't get all of us right um-hum uh and we're beginning to see more and more of that i mean that sounds that's a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake hear you break in and you're gonna get shot yeah yeah that's i mean that's certainly a a possibility and and we have had a a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death um-hum and uh it helps for a while but then just another different set of people come in and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state um-hum hm uh i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught they're from places like up in Oklahoma and Louisiana Arkansas you know across the the border wow so you know people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever it's not many from the local communities but uh um-hum um-hum it's a problem and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties would be a definite deterrent and yeah yeah and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people um-hum i mean i i tend to agree with you i think uh what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes um there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it right and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is um if someone is found guilty of a uh felony level offense they lose their citizenship and they lose their constitutional rights um-hum you know and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just don't protect them i know like in my wife's case they made her feel like the criminal they they went to all all i know and i think i think that's ridiculous  are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the okay sure uh i'll offer anything that i can on the subject uh my husband and i just bought a just moved here recently and uh we bought uh this house about uh i don't know year and a half ago what we have here now is just a basic three bedroom two bath brick house which is uh completely different from what i had had before when i was working and before i married uh i lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and uh historic old houses and things like that so i uh tried to i was in the process of renovating a house and uh that was about seventy five years old oh my so um it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled jacked up um new plumbing new wiring wallpaper paint everything you can think of that house had to have you uh you are experienced i would say well i i really did enjoy it uh you know it was amazing what i found out i could do on my own if i just put my mind to it yeah well i agree i have done done something uh like that too only not nearly nearly as extensive um-hum but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home uh after having a it is it is yeah one that was historical looking that's that's true when uh i met my husband he was living in an apartment at the time and and uh the town that i was living in only about eighty miles from here so um you know i we really it was just the market was so good we hadn't really planned on buying and as you probably heard from the in the Dallas and Texas area period the housing market is just unreal i mean you can get things for such a song yes so that's that's really why we ended up in a house like this his is not what we you know what we want to stay in forever because i have to have my i've found that after doing this other house i have to have my hands into stuff and uh-huh you know i'm always just wanting to paint and and wallpaper and redo and redo so um you know i i'm ready to get ahold of another one that i can have a little more input into so well maybe you can uh make that one charming and and make a little bit money uh yeah that's that's the key you know the thing is uh when we moved in they had just um painted wallpapered we're you know wallpapered new carpet and everything so i feel sort of um you know like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now and do it over just because i'm in the mood to do it so uh we'll see we'll see how much longer we're here yes well we just moved to Charlotte from Enid Oklahoma um-hum oh Oklahoma of all places so i know of what you're talking about as far as the market was concerned and i'll tell you uh we we had kind of a charming house it was a cedar shake house and very weathered and yeah uh-huh right oh yes uh-huh uh it was about fifty years old but not traditional not really uh um-hum traditional looking particularly um-hum um-hum um-hum and uh so i tried to make it after i sold my business i in in i spent almost three years redoing oh yeah and i considered it a full time job oh it is yeah and when we did uh we kind of had planned this uh trek to the east because we're both originally from this part of the country um-hum um-hum i see uh-huh and so i think some of the things that i did paid off for instance one thing that i did that might even be a good suggestion for you uh was something i did on the outside i love old estate estate sales um-hum um-hum yes yes i happened to go to just a little estate sale that just a little white frame house where the couple uh was very old and had gone into nursing homes and um-hum um-hum um-hum oh yeah uh all the men started going down to the barn and so i thought well shoot i'm going to huh oh that's where i need to go yes i'm going to the barn too exactly they uh auctioned some tools and things like that but then they went over and started uh yeah uh-huh auctioning this big stack of bricks oh and so well i thought gee i've been wanting to do some brick uh walkways for a time um-hum work right right uh-huh anyway it ended up after some pretty uh heavy bidding that i got all those bricks for forty dollars um-hum oh my word and so my husband and i loaded bricks in his pickup truck for days oh no oh my word but what we ended up with was about four thousand for forty dollars oh my for forty dollars and so what we did we had built a deck on the back of that house but it needed and it was quite large out to into the yard but on either side of it to the ends of the house um-hum something uh-huh um-hum it just needed to be all tied together so we made brick patios right and walkways oh how fun oh how nice and so for and he he did the digging which was about six inches but i figured the sand and all had that delivered and leveled it and and placed most all the bricks um-hum uh-huh right right um-hum and it turned out beautifully oh i bet and what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way yes well it nearly killed me yeah but but you did stagger stagger back and say oh doesn't this look nice i hated to leave it well let me ask you when you laid those bricks i know my parents bought a house about ten years ago they're fixing to sell it again but and move again they're kind of my mom's like i am she's a renovator a lover of old things um-hum and you know they have to be doing something constantly and the patio that came with that house um was not laid on a like i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something under uh on top of the sand and then lay the bricks but they have they have a problem with these little tiny like sand bugs or something no we well i that drill in between all these bricks and of course you know you have the uh the weeds that come up in between the bricks or and things like that well no i i didn't have that trouble because um we laid the i did get some material and studied every bit of material that i could study but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them because when you start and we put them on a base of four inches of sand sand uh-huh yeah i see oh okay yeah and then we uh we swept sand in between but but it was an error to to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever you just put them together as close as you can um-hum as tight as you can that's probably because they had you know every spring my mom says we're going to have a party a barbecue and tell everybody guess what we're going to we're going to redo the patio you know we're going to pull up all the bricks but uh they just they j ust haven't brought themselves to do it um um-hum yeah well and i also used a rubber hammer a lot to um you know if it wasn't quite level or something i'd just get that rubber hammer and um so uh-huh uh-huh right and and probably you know i think that they could if they have problems with uh sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a uh-huh yeah oh a fairly regular basis for a while anyway right right well the thing that's funny is they've done uh they've done things like that you know i'll catch her out there spraying around and then it's like in two days time she they'll come home from work and those little things are back it's just they're the most resilient little characters and so i don't know what they're finally going to do she may just hopefully they'll sell the house and go somewhere else and then she won't have to worry about it well i think she i think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are and what are these things yeah is it Diazinon or what is it that will uh Dursban or something like that right yeah what it what it is that'll that'll take care of them Dursban i think in this area or most all areas they use you know for ticks and fleas and you know they're awful hard to do anything with yeah right oh that's true that's true but my my dad farms and you know she's always telling him isn't there something that that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray you know out in the out in the field that you can get rid of these bugs but yeah i bet Dursban would do it um it might it might do it yeah she's got so many flower she's got just a gorgeous yard so many um flowers and her her four cats you know so she's sort of uh real funny about what she sprays yeah i think uh you probably just need to make sure that it dries very very carefully uh well before she lets her cats out or something like that um-hum um-hum yeah yeah well gosh Deb we could talk all day couldn't we i know i i was just you know it just seems like i as i said when i heard the what the subject was i thought oh gosh i haven't thought about uh what i went through at that other house in so long i've been so busy but uh i don't know of everything that i did i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do but um gosh you know i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house yes um up up the stairway even you know i just had a ball with it it was so much fun yeah and i've sworn up and down my mom's um wow oh oh good my mom's great grandparents had this huge Victorian house in Paris Texas and the one thing that she ended up with is was the old door that was that was on the front door of that house uh-huh yes and she has that up in her attic and i have sworn that it i'm going to find a house to put that door on before she does so as far as looking toward the future you know that's my plan i'm going to have to move fast i think though because um you know as i said  gun control seems to be a rather um timely topic with all that's going on legislation wise yes and uh the the interesting scale that they assigned it uh the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free i'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle i guess i i don't mind regulating all of the the guns and i would certainly call for a ban on certain types now the the wisdom as to which types that's gonna be a debate forever i would assume uh the method of of controlling it well that's all into how much money you wanna put into the the controls um one point that was made in the house hearings or the the representative who stood up and said that uh you know we can check a guy's credit card instantly but uh we don't wanna check his background and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes uh but there's still the the technology exists to to check it if they want hm right so it's it's it's kind of a uh i guess you got to put a dollar figure on it if you really wanna make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that and then you've got the group the people that decide that there's there's no particular reason to have them at all and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it and i guess i would fall more in the the realm that i like the sport issue of it but i i could give it up without too much trouble it's not the world's most pleasurable thing and it costs a bit to do it uh finding ranges and things like that um i have shot a variety of guns for a number of years but it's just it's not yes right like golf or whatever i mean there are other things that you could go do so uh i i don't see the the joy of shooting is is that much of a driving factor i think uh society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety so the number of kids that tend to get hurt i don't even keep the gun in our house so uh we don't have that problem but uh it's it's a hard hard topic i guess for a lot of people have a lot of hard issue a lot of hard feelings about it yes right they do and you boy you can get them on either side and just like you say uh well i think i i guess i'd have to place myself uh uh probably seven or eight because or not wait wait onto no control i'm sorry uh excuse me that uh uh two or three um-hum uh i was going the wrong direction um because of we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child um-hum because they had a gun in the house and the the father kept the bullets in a separate place but the little boy was five years old and was so intelligent enough to uh he knew where booth both places were loaded the gun and they were playing cowboys and Indians and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes boy so uh i mean it it destroyed two families uh in just that instant and and i a lot of people say that they need it for protection uh having right worked at one time in Baltimore or i don't know if you're in a big city are you Dallas yeah that's a big city um then you know that uh uh Dallas um-hum yeah if you live anywhere real close that uh the safety is uh some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break-ins and you know but uh uh we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up uh i um uh once uh uh knew a fellow that had had been a policeman and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber he's going to assume that you know how to use it well and he's going to you know try to shoot first uh so you know if he's got one um and if not um right then usually they uh if he's got a knife or whatever they could throw it at you i mean you know they he he said that it it's better not to have especially myself now i'm a widow and uh i so i'm right uh when my handicapped son is is not at home i'm by myself but uh there's i still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's it's really um playing Russian Roulette if you do uh yeah about the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the the person was coming your way if once you're surprised it's too late and and the rare circumstances you know the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming and had time to do anything about it that's right that's right right that's right and i don't have that problem is i don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one and the uh NRA's um claim that the uh the constitutional and the right to bear arms and that whole statement uh it's hard to know the original intent but i i don't see it as that that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that uh yeah its the right to to arm a militia and as opposed to just the general public and you have a right you have a earn a right not just a privilege as it were if you were gonna serve in the militia then you have a right to have that arm but uh or you know there's all sorts of arguments there but i don't even worry about that's right i know the what the original intent was they didn't have this problem back then so we we change our rights with our social status they're man given rights and they can be taken away by a man so no no that's true that that's that's right that's right right uh the people that hide behind that i don't worry about they can go live in another country if they want well the yeah that's how i feel too i know well even even here where i work uh we have uh a gun club and of course those people are very avid they you know they say there should be no ban that it's not but i can't see why any uh on on the street citizen should be able allowed to be allowed to have a machine gun um-hum right uh you know when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns it would be hard to decide but there are a few guns that uh just are not uh sport or i mean i don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either so um uh i i think they should have at least some control over over those things um when and when you were speaking about they can check up right you know on credit cards well i i understand about the privacy act and everything but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not that to me would not be an unreasonable thing and if they do course right the argument with the people in the gun club um is that uh well the people that are going to get guns are the ones who are going to steal them anyway right and so it's not gonna be that they're buying them course some of them do yeah so it it it is a hard question tends to tends to strap only the legitimate people most regulation does most it's very difficult to uh legislate uh right oh yeah crooks or whatever you wanna however you wanna word it so it's well this may be a never ending topic i got a couple of calls waiting on me so i better let you go that's right okay well thanks for talking bye-bye now okay bye  all right yes yes i think we're terribly taxed i i think the Republicans have taxed us just as much as the Democrats and i don't think there's a change between one party than the other uh i think we get get a lot back but not as much as we should uh i guess what i feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it there's got to be something when when we pay so much for the for the debt instead of using the money for where it ought to go it it's just it's ridiculous What kills me is when they had a chance to to uh put into action action the the Gramm the Gramm Rudman what is it right uh the act where they had to cut everything across the board they kept doing they kept putting off doing that why did they do that that's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together the Gramm the Gramm Rudman Act yeah yeah well i think they spend too much they they spend too much on themselves too the the oh yeah i think so too a lot of the the taxes gets back to the members of the Congress and everything all running for twenty years rather than yeah well things like mailings they don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things they just think once they get there that they can do just anything you know they don't they don't try to uh to conserve no you're right and of course here at home we end up conserving and conserving and i mean when i don't have money i don't buy something yeah no i think uh it it is the Congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money uh they sure don't seem to the national debt is terrible uh there're a couple of things i think we need to really work for and i don't know quite how to do it but i think we need to have the one line uh uh veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything if it's a good idea it can be done again right oh yeah you know and if it's not so what at least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months yeah i saw one on Twenty Twenty uh about a month ago i guess whereas one i think that he was a Senator from Pennsylvania or something like that maybe it was uh Connecticut i'm not sure one of the small states up there where he had a bill through for another um a drug agency that would be located there and he was the only one that wanted it it was going to cost millions of dollars the drug agency didn't want it and he was going to build it in his home town and they were going to hire a lot of people and it was ridiculous you know the whole thing and and you know they they asked him about it and yeah this is that's right do you really need this this is going to cost a lot of money oh yes we need it but do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this yeah and they do things that are you know just like the uh yeah that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on and the trouble is you don't you have so little input about it you don't know enough yeah that right to know what what to do about some of this stuff i right yeah they're supposed to do what we say but they do what they they want to do really yeah that's right the other thing about is i think uh limiting their time in office would be good i i just can't believe there aren't other people out there that could do just as well as what we've got absolutely absolutely we need to get that through we we have said that i've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two year two terms is enough for all of them yeah uh whether you're mayor all the way up city council the works i think certainly President that uh two terms is plenty yeah i think that's right and then we get these professionals out of there and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves you know rather than living off of us yeah wouldn't that be too bad well that's right i think i don't know i think uh people in general the the the the idea of what you need to to exist is so outrageous that it's not hardly you know it starts at the courts it starts everywhere um-hum right until we can't we've just lost control of of any kind of perspective about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable you know well it's so much money and you can't even add it up you know that's why they think it's no you can't even can't even conceive of what they're talking about yeah when you talk about the trillions of dollars on this and that our national debt in the trillions of dollars you know yeah yeah i mean it just and and you just the other thing is it's it's all very well to give money to help people other people and i think we need to do that but there are they need to put more limits on them they need to restrain about what they do foreign aid yeah foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it's absolutely necessary they they've given that away for fifty years yeah i i you know i think that's probably unless unless we can afford it if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again i agree i agree you know i don't really mind helping people but you you need to get rid of this thing that's that's just uh eating us up um-hum you know and get things on a on an even if it were if it were a family we'd be up before the the magistrate right for for doing all these wicked things you know but the government does it and it's all right yeah i i know we're taxed to death on every every thing i don't know what's the best way to do it but uh they don't even talk about that they just raise it they don't even consider it like you saying is to cut something back you know yeah that's true well sounds like they are at least doing something now with the uh the military you know they're cutting some of that but of course now you know TI you know that's hurting us but although yeah it's good to see them doing some things there anyway TI has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else and if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic uh weapon systems but uh yeah that's the only good that i've seen Congress do you know and everybody and all the Congressmen and the President and everybody uh well i think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens we're going to have to bite the bullet and we're all going to have to do it i it just isn't fair though that when this happens in some places it needs to all come off everywhere yeah yeah that's why i thought well you know this is the time they need to put that into action into action and show they mean business that they've got to cut they've got to cut costs yeah the only taxes i think that are well spent well not the only but uh i think the now i i don't understand the present school thing but uh i have two daughters one's in college already and one's about uh to be in high school but uh i think that paying for school schools is the schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime and so i don't mind paying for school taxes even though my kids will be out of it you know yeah i think that's right well i don't i don't really mind paying taxes for for positive things that are helps like roads and making sure that uh that water is safe and some of these things but um yeah you know it you just fe el like it's out of control you feel like they do not have control of it and that and so then it just aggravates you you know you think i could spend my money i could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing yeah the spending is out of control yeah oh i agree with you so it's i i thin k that's a wide open subject what i think that uh people need to take a stand i think the people will here shortly uh yeah well i think that's right if they don't do if they don't if they don't pull it in and start doing something i think they're really going to have to i think i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out too that what they did last election and uh ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in you know so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes you know they're supposed to represent us that's what they're called but they don't yeah yeah maybe maybe maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there guys and gals whatever they are yeah in some ways we're awful lucky i guess there a lot of lot of places where it's worse than it is here but i know but it still you don't want it to get that bad good heavens no that's right you don't want to uh you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be no we need to get try to get hold of it and and have it be things be honest and and i guess in the fact i don't really mind paying taxes but i would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent that they're doing something that's positive for for somebody right i don't really feel like uh i don't really feel like i use taxes very much i don't know maybe i do more than i i guess i do i use them in the in roads and lot of things but uh yeah that's you're right well i think one of the good ones in the metroplex uh in the last say twenty five years or so maybe longer they've built all these dams you know the Corps of Engineers have uh soon as they finish a lake they'll go at get another one and that we haven't had we've had droughts here in long summers yeah we've had good water supply and that's due to the Corps of Engineers building looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us you know yeah they've done some good things the state actually did some good good work on that in that a couple of years ago yeah uh Sam Johnson came out and talked to us about that bout what they had done and they they really had done some good yeah some good work yeah i think anything for water supply like California should do more of that too yeah yeah there are a lot of places places where they're in real trouble and and i think it would be easy enough to be in trouble here too if they don't take if they don't take that early stand right right they just finished Joe Poole Lake over here and they need to start another one i think every time they finish one they ought to just have another one in line the water's critical yeah that's probably right the growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait until something until they need them right well it's good to talk to you okay yeah how many calls have you made oh about nine oh yeah i'm up to twenty are you a TI'er no i just just a housewife i just heard about it and found it fun guess i like to talk that's all oh well great great okay well it's been some interesting subjects yeah right thanks for calling bye-bye uh-huh bye now  do you have any particular thoughts about the school system well um i i think that in in uh recently with the i'm not sure if it's more a problem with American families or a problem with the school system they seem to be burdening the school system more and more with problems any problems that a child might have whether it's actually a school related thing or not and i i say agree with you a hundred percent there yeah and and well it's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything oh if uh you've some kid who doesn't have uh who's from a broken family the schools are supposed to fill that void it's gotten way beyond teaching uh you know teaching classes and uh maybe providing extracurricular sports activities or something like oh were kind of traditionally the school's roles yeah yeah it's interesting because uh we're just having conversation on this uh with a couple of people yesterday and i was expressing my frustrations that uh some of the so many problems i i work in a high school are that kids don't have a a degree uh a of self-discipline which may be reflected in society at large uh and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract uh sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home right um and it's seen more so because when you call parents up many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem and will say they'll say oh well our kids my kid i've never heard anything about this before this is the first time there have been problems and and you say don't these parents know that teachers talk and you know we do check with other teachers and other teachers find the same things for this child and you know how do you tell your parent's the parent hey wake up and smell the coffee right right but um it it is a problem and i'm not sure just uh how how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it whether maybe through a commitment of the PTA yeah uh and the parents being informed better that in fact that the problems that are nationwide yeah are are problems um of society and that that the school can only do so much on it well then then again when you have uh a society where a certain percentage of the parents are uh doing drugs in the home uh either unemployed and don't care about a uh just a have their own problems um-hum yeah yeah how how do you expect the school to um or how do you expect the you can't really expect that parent who's quite frankly a loser in life as it is to to care about the the situation with their child and that's right um-hum you know what scares me too is that we have yet to see uh the biggest effect of the crack children right uh in the school system these are children that are born with low deficit attention deficit and gosh what's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system that that's really scary right yeah but there are i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve and this is something that i see too many times students get diagnosed as slow learners and in fact they're not they're behavior problems right and so they get put in in in our school system in a class that's limited for skills children that have really have to master skills and that's not their problem um-hum um at the same time i've seen we we have a uh an international population there's no bridge area for students coming out of the ESOL which is English for Speakers of Other Languages program the once they're past ESOL they get out they got thrown right into the total mainstream uh-huh right and uh there really needs to be a bridge some sort of transition right for that so the school systems can improve both in standing up for splitting classes you know having learning disabled learning slow slow children in slow classes but not mixing them with behavior problems right and then you know the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated right and then you throw in kids that are not motivated maybe bright but they're discipline problems and you sometimes the average classes really are problems because you've got such a mixed bag there um-hum right you know the gifted and talented are fast classes there's really not that much of a problem with but it's well i i've seen more uh incredibly intelligent intelligent underachievers than than uh um-hum i personally i will i would take a person who's motivated and a little uh less intelligent than the person who uh is one of these very intelligent people who just kind of that's yeah isn't motivated to do anything i remember i had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspiration yeah well i i not to toot my own horn here or anything but i i was graduated from my high school i was the valedictorian and i know that there were a lot of kids that were an awful lot smarter than me um-hum and they proved out like when it came time to take the SATs mine were good but they weren't great and uh um-hum um-hum when i got into college i struggled i struggled just to uh get my degree in the in the field that i was in whereas i knew people that yeah in high school were kind of lazy and all but they got motivated in college and they did a lot better than i did and when it yeah i guess kids do mature at different ages too that's and you know as a teacher you you try to make be understanding that you know there are different ages kids are is right that a kid that's just a question of maturity or is he problem child but teachers are asked to diagnose so much hum um there i mean i mean we're have to be we're alerted there's all sorts of systems where suicide right uh predisposition i mean we're alerted to what the moment we see something if we see a child that we have any reason that's on drugs such as if he's got a beeper or if they're if they're flashing lots of money around we've there are certain things to do i mean so teachers the school system's asked to do so much but you can't operate in a vacuum you actually have students with with beepers this is a we're in a rather wealthy suburb of Washington uh-huh and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the uh principal i mean where what are the what could they possibly be thinking i mean how it's for drug use they can't imagine for anything else yeah you you know it's it's amazing but uh you get all sorts you get all all sorts of things uh in the schools uh uh and it's and you know as a teacher you're alert you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy you're alert to the kid who suddenly has a um behavioral change and you refer them to the nurse and right and so i mean you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason or whether this is a warning signal yeah can you how can you how can you expect to and parents frequently resent when you ask them is there a problem that we should be aware of oh yeah i i was uh sitting in the barber shop i'm i'm an officer in the Air Force and i was having my hair cut um-hum and the barber uh got a call while i was there uh from his son's school his son's in high school and his son was failing gym and uh and having trouble with a few other things but you know it's like uh this guy was like why now there's no problem with my kid my kid's a great kid and all this the kid had missed all these classes and basically he his answer was oh i gave him permission to to miss um-hum yeah the denial mechanism is really strong and so many parents are facilitators i mean they're manipulated by their children i've been fortunate i have uh yeah right a son who's a sophomore in college up in Massachusetts at uh Amherst and my other son is a senior in high school and he's going on to Williams and i mean they're really super they're both national level swimmers uh-huh sure and where we've been very fortunate but you know they had to be held accountable too i mean you know at some point a parent does help their kid but in in some ways but but you have to say at what point isn't the help becoming negative right sure and i think this is where the school system uh is suffering and not through any fault of the effort of the school system right but gee it was good talking with you it was good talking to you too yeah so there are people throughout the country that feel the same ways that you do and and are connected with the schools yeah yeah i've had interesting conversations on several subjects not uh not just this but different the different things it's amazing how the you know people you talk to have some interesting conversations and uh it's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base and that none of the ideas or thoughts are um-hum being used at all well we are both listen good luck take care bye-bye yeah that's true all right yep bye-bye  yeah i have what uh about yourself well uh a few i guess uh i was trying to think as i was asking you just exactly what movies i had seen recently i i took my wife to see one uh oh my goodness i can't you tell me first because i can't think right now yeah i i should because i've been waiting for a few minutes to talk uh interesting interestingly enough i had the same topic yesterday when i called so i've got my spiel down you mean you had the same topic twice um uh-huh twice in a row second time it's happened to me but uh hum let's see last week my wife and i went to see uh Kindergarten Cop oh now that was great we saw that too yeah that was it was it was pretty cool it's the first time i've seen him do a uh a comedy almost type show yeah which is kind of a a change for Arnold Schwarzenegger right yeah now that was a good show my my wife and i enjoyed that a lot i think the kids did too we didn't go together though oh they went another time though yeah they well i got one runs around i got two boys and one boy runs around with one his group of friends and the other boy runs around with his group of friends i think both of them separately saw it at two different times even with their group of friends wow and then mom and dad went to see it when it went to the dollar and a half movie house yeah well fortunately we have a dollar movie here so i they used to be a dollar here but it finally went up oh i hope doesn't i think they're hedging to but uh i don't want them anyway it was worth uh two bucks for my wife and i to go yeah oh yeah it was good show really was uh we went to see uh The King i think it's The King Mary Jo and i did so okay that's the one that uh oh i forget the guy's name that stars with Roseanne on TV oh what's that yeah Goodman and uh that was funny now that was really a good show Goodman okay i mean it wasn't a great show it's just a B movie but it was fun i think uh i think uh you and your wife would enjoy that it's pretty light hearted humor and and and it was uh it was kind of neat kind of cute yeah couple of dollars worth of laughs oh it was definitely worth that it it was worth couple of bucks just to get out and watch that and it was upbeat movie and everything else and uh you know uh eat the popcorn and all that yeah that's where they make the money is on the popcorn anyway they charge ridiculous prices they charge more for the popcorn than they do for the movie right yeah The King huh okay yeah i think it's called The King or something like that it's it's uh John Goodman i think it's you know and he's the main star in the whole movie okay and it's got a a couple pretty good uh supporting actors all right and uh it's funny it it really is uh you know we uh rather enjoyed trying to think of a couple of others that we went to see that we went to see one movie i can't remember the name of it now though but it was uh oh what was it i can't remember it's just terrible anyway i i long time back uh uh for the benefit at least of the subject we're discussing i went to see Die Hard Two i guess it was Die Die Harder yeah yeah and that was a scream and you know i thought that was pretty good and um yeah uh i don't know i can't think of another one other than that at the moment how about you well uh my wife has a problem with uh she can't suspend her disbelief of a movie like she'll sit there and say that won't happen that can't happen there's no way you know so it's kind of hard for me to pick like a uh like if we would go see a Von Dame movie and he runs around the screen for an hour and half just kicking teeth you know uh-huh um-hum um-hum he she'd be like no he he couldn't do that you can't beat up ten guys at once with guns and so she can't really enjoy it yeah so she can't even enjoy it but i think we're working on her a little bit where she just sits back and takes the movie at what it is uh-huh so we've been working uh a couple of friends of myself uh-huh uh we've been you know we'll go to like uh Segal or we haven't went to Segal yet we're going to and Van Damme and like uh Stallone uh-huh yeah like like the First Blood Stallone just did a comedy incidentally that uh i think's out now yeah that's what the guy told me last night he's like a gangster or something yeah yeah so i'd like to see that yeah i'm kind of looking forward that my wife says there's one she wants me to take her to see this weekend and uh i'm trying it's about a it it it's one that was done a long time ago i think Tony Curtis uh uh uh was uh the star in where the guy dies falls overboard or something and comes back as a woman huh and uh there's uh uh a movie coming out uh gosh what's the name of that it's already out matter of fact it's been advertised on TV um about a guy that falls over he he gets killed somehow or another and he comes back as a woman and you talk about funny at least the little snapshot previews that they've shown on TV advertising it are hilarious i mean it is really funny and uh so we're going to go see that yeah now we saw a movie called Sisters what's uh that may have been almost a year ago now i think about it that was quite good i don't know if you've did that have that girl from Cheers in it uh let's see i don't remember whether Cheers no i don't think so you mean Christie okay yeah no i don't think she was in this one i kind was trying to remember exactly who the characters were but uh it was a real touching show about three sisters oh okay this was a comedy so it probably wouldn't be the same one no no this this was a real uh uh sort of serious piece it had some light moments but basically it was a serious piece i thought it was just called Sisters or something like that or the The Sisters or The Three Sisters or something um uh i can't really quite remember and then we saw one uh some time back it's a shame i can't remember the titles of these for the benefit of this conversation although it may not be that the uh necessarily the uh intent but nevertheless that that we saw one here a while back that Dolly Parton and several ladies starred in three or four or five uh three or four women together with old Shirley MacLaine oh yeah i i don't know the name of it either yeah yeah and yeah that was pretty good it was okay uh you know most of t his stuff is B movies anyway have you seen Awakenings with Robin Williams no i haven't i would suggest that it's have you seen that yes i have was it really good i i have heard all kinds of mixed things about it well i'm uh leaning toward medical professions myself so it had some uh are you you know he was a doctor and it was in a clinical uh psychologist something right um-hum yeah psychiatric uh clinical setting so it was interesting to to say the least from that standpoint because it is a true story uh-huh and oh yeah that's right i think it was a take off from true story you're right yeah so uh yeah who was the guy he rehabilitated he starred in Taxi or not Taxi uh yeah oh yeah it was Robert DeNiro right was it DeNiro yeah that he just did an incredible job of acting did he well did you ever see speaking of uh of uh medical oriented movie or at least a movie about somebody got rehabilitated did you ever see the one uh that Dustin Hoffman starred in Rain Man yeah now wasn't that a good show yeah now that see if you liked that you would i really enjoyed it oh man i enjoyed that show okay if you liked that um you'd probably my wife and i both enjoyed that yeah you would enjoy Awakenings Awakenings is as touching uh-huh huh but it doesn't have the the language and other things that might detract from the movie uh-huh uh-huh it's it's really it's a movie that wouldn't mind taking my kids to oh i see that's good and i mean it's really clean and but it's it doesn't lose any quality i mean uh-huh i think sometimes movies try to spice it up a little bit with things unnecessary uh language or nudity or whatever yeah yeah yeah but this one here is Awakenings is very clean that was the only thing i didn't like about uh uh-huh rain man it sure it makes it true to life and everything but uh you know about Rain Man it was language is harsh every now and then yeah yeah but yeah it was cool i'd probably seen it three or four times right yeah that that was uh one that we really enjoyed i was trying to think of uh oh what was that one though it slips me now unfortunately i should have done thinking about this well it's you called on the spur of the moment you don't really know yeah yeah um oh uh how about any older shows like John Wayne movies and things like you got any favorites along those lines oh yeah uh i like most of the old John Wayne westerns uh like El Dorado is that one and uh yeah me too oh yeah yeah i like almost everything he yeah i really love rue Grit yeah True Grit Rooster Cogburn and uh yeah oh man they i thought they were really really fun they were interesting and the one he did with his boys uh Jake Big Jake yeah i've seen that on TV several times and that was a lot of fun movie you know i have kind of favorite because i like the uh the musical scores to it matter of fact i had to hunt for years to finally find a copy of the record uh because they made so few of them it wasn't really wasn't all that popular and that was uh uh not was it Hogan's Heroes or yeah that TV show or Kelly's Heroes Kelly Heroes name of the show the one that Clint Eastwood stars in and uh and Carroll O'Connor Kelly's Heroes yeah yeah uh-huh now that's one of my favorite shows i really enjoy i've been trying to tape that one for years and haven't succeeded in doing so yet really but i finally did find an album i had to look around several different dealers here in the uh uh Maryland area and put the word out to find the album that had the uh movie score on it that you know they open the show with uh uh a movie score with a score to that and then they wind up at the end playing a tune that is just one of my favorites i've loved it for years and i'm sitting here as i tell you this trying to think of the name of it but uh it's sung by the Herb Alpert congregation uh the uh the uh the opening and the closing score of Kelly Heroes the do you remember much about that movie the Kelly's Heroes the movie yeah yeah i i remember that uh uh their on there way into Germany they make up their own little army you might say they start out small but they get bigger and bigger all the time they bribe this guy well little bribe he's willing to go in on it they've got three tanks that have these huge pipes he puts on the turrets to make uh-huh  okay do you have any children uh yes i have a daughter um-hum i don't any children so i'm gonna have difficulty with this topic but uh what kind of things do you and your family do oh okay um well we go out and fly kites and we go fishing and we go to movies hm and we go out to the farm and and uh she likes to pick flowers and look at birds um-hum hm then your kind of family is probably pretty rare now a days i don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that that's great well well i'm divorced but that's what when she's with me that's what we do yeah and we color a lot and i read her stories and um-hum that's great yep i think uh a lot of families now for they probably don't spend enough time together you know whether they're yeah whether the parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together and and i think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is uh being destroyed yep just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like fishing and because that i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot and the communication helps you build on your uh helps just just build your family um-hum yeah and even even when i was when i was uh living with her and we did stuff then too so um-hum yeah that's pretty to me that's pretty rare yeah i know i think that whenever i do have children i'll i'm gonna try as hard as i can to see see that we spend a lot of time together you know maybe just even if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make sure that everybody's not going out and doing and their own thing all the time um-hum and you know that's good sometimes because you need to you know get away but uh i don't think you you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of of losing your family the family unit yeah that's right because then you never get to know them either they're all grown up and their you know um-hum yeah yeah and as i understand it i don't know i haven't experienced it but you know kids these days are growing up so much faster yeah um-hum you know once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve you know you've pretty much lost them yeah they're out doing stuff by that time um-hum yeah so um do you think that you do you think that your family's pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter yeah yeah i really do because because i don't see many other this and when whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays we'll see other families um-hum but not usually on the on the uh weekends we don't see very many in comparison what do you think is the key to just bringing the American family back together what what kinds of things do you think can well i think they ought to turn off the TV for one thing yeah that's true that's and and go out and do stuff you know because she always likes to do things whenever the TV's off you know she'll forget about the TV completely hm right i think that's the first thing a lot of people do and i know i'm guilty of it like i came in from work today first thing i did was turn the TV on because i taped the stories from earlier today um-hum right and i like to watch them but i think that's that is a big problem television it's it's it's too static you know it's something that you can do but you there's no thinking involved no motion you know and i think i think that's another reason why people are uh so health conscious now is because America's becoming really a couch potato society um-hum you know people aren't doing anything just sitting around you know no thinking involved and now i think i think people are trying to get out of that at least and that um you know there's a lot of um it's it's becoming really health conscious and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that um-hum and that's probably good you know if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that that also helps that's also something you know family oriented that everyone can do yeah hm yeah but when was uh when she was here last summer we played tennis but she hasn't brought her tennis racket over lately hum-um and we how how old is she she's five um well she has we we just been hitting the ball on the ground yeah yeah she can't hit it in the air yet and then we kick the ball we play like soccer we'll you still have a lot of time before she gets up in years that's good that's good um-hum yeah hm okay well it was very nice talking to you nice talking to you okay bye-bye okay bye-bye  i guess i'm calling to tell you about my exercise program which is a little bit lacking right now i've slacked off in the last six months but for several years i have walked three miles a day um-hum okay i'm a walker also um-hum are you uh and that my walking was a fast walk uh to get the heart rate up to an aerobic level right and i in fact i was enjoying it so much uh that i was doing it like seven days a week and i i pretty much had to cut that back though to five oh boy how far could you how far did you walk i mean um i know time wise you need at least twenty minutes how many miles a day uh i well it was about three about three okay um-hum um-hum and i walked thirty minutes i did the uh slow walk kind of a normal walk for five and the aerobic walk for twenty and cool down walk for the last five um-hum oh okay oh yeah okay but and and it was i was it was so much fun to watch the progress because as i uh went along when i started uh at first i had to uh i didn't have to use my arms all that much to uh you know get the heart rate up but then after about uh yeah four weeks then i had to use them all the time and then i had to i found that i had to raise them above my head and kind of down my back to to get the heart rate up it was very progressive it was progressive oh boy uh-huh yeah i that's that's is very quickly also yeah i thought well now i guess probably six weeks before i had to do my arms the whole time the whole twenty minutes um-hum i see did you find that when you walked like after you you were getting this aerobic uh benefits did not just the heart rate but did you see a difference in in your body also oh my gosh yes i have the cutest turned up tail you ever saw no no i did notice uh a lot of difference oh is that right yeah okay yeah the reason i ask is i've always really enjoyed walking and i know um you know i i it doesn't bother me to take walks by myself i just when i walk i just i i think i enjoy the scenery you know and i've always found it relaxing it's always something i've enjoyed doing and for me i've found that as long as i try to take almost everyday at least say a twenty minute walk or a half an hour walk maybe more if i can that it's really makes a difference in my weight control oh gosh yes um in the winter months well here you know i'm sure down there the winter's a little better than here but in the winter months January and February are are the hard months and you have some really cold days and i don't walk much at all in the winter and i really you know i i gain a little bit of weight but i think uh-huh you know you really start to feel it as far as your clothes how you feel um and i i i was doing um once in awhile floor aerobics uh i but i developed arthritis and and i had to give up the the floor aerobics for a while but walking is something that i continued to do uh-huh and um i don't know i find for me that um it's just something that i never have gotten tired of whereas when i take an aerobics class by the end of the twelve weeks i'm glad to uh finish it well i think may be you like doing it alone you like doing it on your own time too yeah yeah it's uh it's uh i i you know i know my neighbor will go is very disciplined will get up six o'clock in the morning and and do rowing and aerobics tapes and i don't have that type of discipline but um-hum um i you know i found that it's not necessary really necessary to knock yourself out to that degree to keep fit and i really think walking is probably one of the best things because it's something if you live into your nineties you could continue to do i think so to well and i i was very pleased uh when uh during cold weather and i haven't lived in Charlotte North Carolina a full year yet but uh yeah i see when i lived in a colder climate i had access to one of those Schwinn bicycles oh yeah the ones that you you know you have to use your arms also and so on those days i did thirty minutes on the bike now that was a little boring because i did it alone right oh i see yeah and uh with you know you can't read very very well if you're using your arms and uh you can't put a book on that type of arms but that was i was very lucky there but here i have dogs that i take uh on long walks right right right um-hum and that makes it a lot better to have their company yeah but as i said i'm not doing quite it quite as well now because we're in a temporary situation and what i had uh also found that i guess it's like um certain addition um once it well it it's easier to quit if you start uh um stopping shall i say and if you skip some days then uh it's awfully hard to get back to a regular routine um-hum um-hum yeah i think that's true um you know i found that oh i used to be just a fanatic walker even when i was pregnant with with my first child i i walked two three times a day for twenty minutes to half an hour i must have walked about five minutes a day and um-hum and um and then um when i well then i had two kids and you know that makes it a little harder sometimes and then i was working and then when i i found when when i got arthritis one of the bad things about it that comes with it is is fatigue and sure um and and i found that i was tiring very quickly and i couldn't walk like a used to but i saw a big difference in my figure yeah and um i'm just i'm i'm doing better because i'm under control using medications so i'm getting back into yes yes yes this walking everyday but it's really true once you haven't done it for a while it's very difficult to start back again but once you really are into it i was definitely addicted to walking i had to have my walk everyday um-hum well and i well i had support from my husband too which was is very nice he felt that i needed to put that first and uh i don't believe a lot of woman always have that kind of support um-hum yeah yeah no i yeah that's true i um um fortunate enough that he doesn't travel that much and that whenever as soon as he gets home from work or whatever i'll say after dinner well you know i'm i'm talking off for my walk you know hum-um yes yes and uh yeah that's that's true and you know i've i've had his support there to anytime i've taken a class aerobics in the evening or something you know we've always been able to work it out um hum-um but right now i'm taking water aerobics also and that's a little bit different it's it's more strenuous then i figured it would be um then you thought yes i've had those and i think they're excellent yeah i think so i've i've talk and now i'm only talking it one day a week some of the woman there take it two and three days a week and they say that when you take it two or three days a week you will see a difference um-hum oh i'm sure oh my gosh yes i i think it's wonderful i've had it and on a regular basis and uh uh-huh i found it a lot more fatiguing than my uh walking program in fact um-hum yeah i agree i agree there's something about being in the water and exercising and you come out and you have a big appetite yes yes well it's been fun talking to you and i wish you lots of luck with your endeavors you you also okay you you too and uh have a good summer then down there okay uh-huh bye-bye thank thank you bye-bye  okay well i heard Dallas is pretty bad with the crime well you know you last night i was listening to the uh ten o'clock news uh-huh and for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings the number of drug deals that were going on and crime and and it's so depressing just to even listen to the news anymore um-hum the same way here in Dennison i mean uh back a couple weeks ago they found uh um-hum some people i don't remember at some fast food restaurant they had been i can't remember if they been shot or if they just been thrown in the freezer but i'm pretty sure they'd been shot and put the freezer at the fast food restaurant uh-huh uh-huh and i've worked in fast food restaurants they don't have that much money on hand they really don't yeah yeah i did too i remember used i used to work at uh Kentucky Fried Chicken and uh and i just couldn't believe um you know that now i would hate to work at a fast food restaurant or even have my children work in one uh-huh uh-huh and uh because of the the crime that they would uh just kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there uh in their cash drawer yeah right my husband worked at a gas station when he was a teenager um-hum and he well i don't know he decided not to work one night or something and one of the guys that was working was shot and Kenny quit the next day he just he couldn't deal with it um-hum um-hum yeah yeah oh i understand what your talking about so yeah i have uh uh you know a real problem uh even though i live further out in the suburbs the crime follows you anywhere it it doesn't matter if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this uh-huh everywhere um-hum um so but i just think about all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from it just seems like a lot of people are attracted to the bigger cities though the worst part of it um-hum um-hum um i lived in Louisville Kentucky for a while i i lived on the outskirts too but Louisville was pretty bad especially during like the uh um-hum Kentucky Derby at this time of the year it's horrible to live in Louisville yeah um-hum um-hum yeah so i don't know um you know it's asking about what kind of steps we can take um but uh uh you know just as citizens to try and um uh protect ourselves i know i have um you know a home security system plus i have the uh the special lights uh on on the outside and i have this uh-huh the ones that blink off and on for the self i mean yeah that uh yeah yeah by themselves uh if you if there's some kind of movement then they'll automatically come on um but i mean it's just that i constantly think about keeping us safe and protected verses um right uh-huh how many kids do you have two two oh a boy or one of each um-hum yeah yeah oh that's what i've got it is scary are your babies are they babies or no no they're teenagers now oh well good that they're a comfort to you i've still got babies i've got yeah i've got a four a four year old he'll be four and a three month old and it's scary sometimes oh wow yes that's a problem yeah i'm used to living in uh which we don't live in the city but we just um-hum it's still more crowded than what i'm used to i'm used to having you know eight or ten houses on one street and this one's got houses on either side and you know real close together and just um-hum yeah yeah it's different yeah living down here now now the nice thing uh i feel a little bit more comfort since we're so close together like this um uh i feel like that there's going to be uh less crime or your neighbors going to be watching out for you um because it's it's practically it's in their backyard too right oh oh well we think our neighbors are stealing from us actually my husband they uh well the one of them's a teenager lives next door and her friends are pretty wild um-hum they've stolen gas out of our vehicles and well he went and got a locking gas cap for his they weren't stealing it out of mine so much because my car the gas thing is kind of weird where it's hard to siphon gas out oh goodness um-hum uh-huh uh-huh so he went he went and got a locking gas cap and they cut tried to break that off he oh my goodness excuse me um-hum he went down to Uba and noticed that it was hanging off where they had tried to break it off and they stole our tailgate off his truck uh-huh oh goodness well we can't say they did but someone did yeah we're pretty yeah it had to be somebody that you know could do it in the middle of the night and you know they'd seen it earlier um-hum um-hum yeah i know that uh it's uh it's a real problem it doesn't matter really where you are anymore it's uh more of a matter of what you the steps that you do to keep yourself safe um-hum and um so that's that's what i try and uh do well the only things that we can do as citizens is you know like those uh watch groups that they'll have walking but they can be dangerous too and i've thought about it you know uh um-hum um-hum really uh-huh this isn't like walking around and looking for somebody you can get yourself into trouble yeah yeah you know i was uh going home the other day and i saw um a guy who who looked like he was breaking into a window and i thought gee whiz you know i don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's the he's the person who lives there uh-huh uh you know and and i was thinking well i need to call the police when i get back home and because it was about oh about four or five blocks from where we live and uh and i thought no you know uh-huh because i wouldn't know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight but anymore you know the crime happens in daylight as it does in at night yeah well i watched it on TV oh i guess last year sometime they'll break in at the day in the daytime and um-hum i hear that you know it if if you lock yourself out of your house and you try to get in your house it'll you give that half the time it takes you to break in uh a professional could break in in in half that time um-hum uh-huh in half that time wow and that's so scary so scary you you think you've got yourself all locked in and safe and and uh somebody could break in a nd uh well i have a dog that's the one thing that i like is yeah it is uh-huh i'm getting me uh i want a German Shepherd um i don't want any of those ones that will up the kids but i do want a German Shepherd um-hum um-hum right um-hum um-hum because my husband'll leave every once in a while for he works on the railroad and i'm scared here by myself so um-hum uh-huh oh yeah oh yeah so that's another uh we just a little dog now but he is just as vicious as if you know if you if somebody and loud and loud you know and i thought that uh you know we'd have to have a big dog but we don't need a big dog we got this little bitty dog that uh part Dachshunds and part uh Cocker Spaniel and he um he's very protective um-hum uh-huh yeah Cocker Spaniels are loud well there yeah very protective now that's one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbor's got a noisy dog that's a deterrent because they know that that dog's going to bark um-hum um-hum that's right but it's easy to fool a dog too you know throw them meat or yeah um-hum uh it's a real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat right from what i've hear you know saw on TV um-hum oh wow gosh well it was nice talking to you yeah it was okay well and uh maybe we'll meet up again alrighty bye-bye okay bye-bye  current events are uh sometimes hard to keep up with there've been several days when i've been busy doing one thing or the other and don't catch the news on the TV or don't get around to a paper um-hum huh and uh it's it takes a little bit of time to stay up on things i kind of prefer uh uh uh if i want to know something about a given topic uh about some some major event that's going on i kind of prefer to go to the public television route uh watch some of the the longer exposes on the given topic it's yes like the Lehrer News Hour or something yeah i think that's that's helpful i think that's right right right i i i listen to the evening news you know to get the kind of thumbnail things but i try to read the paper each day uh covering the the headlines and then the in each of the sections and then i think i enjoy the editorials about as much as anything hm yeah that's uh editorials give you uh an insight into people's perspective of of issues better than you know it's really funny to look at somebody and say well i never really thought of it that way how could they think that way you know an yes yeah that's right that's right or or to help you understand really how you think i think sometimes um we're very divided about about our feelings about things and uh sometimes the editor will help me focus uh you know somebody who's thought about it at great length in order to write something about it right usually has a kind of an uh an approach that maybe i hadn't quite considered um-hum and i find them very interesting and helpful i think to uh settling my mind about things right the uh radio has become uh a new tool that i started using lately i'd had it on the local KRLD for a long time but now uh plus with uh CNN a station broadcasting CNN's headline news just the audio portion of it it's a good little clip in the morning i can catch ten fifteen minutes of that to cover it covers the morning real well um yeah i think yeah i used to listen a lots when i drove but i don't i have eye problems and i don't drive now and i i don't listen to the radio very much just because i don't i'm not where it is yeah i i keep one in most every room and i end up uh the mornings in the bathroom during the shower and the like i can pretty well cover that twenty minute segment that CNN does in the morning uh that's a good idea yeah that's a good idea and they if you leave out the sports you can really get everything in about ten minutes yeah and they cover uh most of the nations events especially during the war time as it was going on they keep me up to date on how my brother-in-law was doing over there and yeah that's true uh um-hum and it was nice to hear the the what plane had and hadn't crashed because he was flying them and um-hum uh the bias though that i find uh kind of another topic the the bias that i find in some of the coverages it's kind of hard on oh let's say it's a major issues to get uh an unbiased opinion i think so too uh you just happen to have a type of person that gravitates toward that that profession then you end up with a hierarchy in that profession that won't promote someone with a a uh different point of view so yeah different point of view yeah i think you have to be very careful in it with the media in that for that reason because they they are not because they are very biased uh-huh most of them have very biased feelings it's hard to hard to get one i'll tell you the the we take the Insight magazine and i find it to be as uh about as unbiased as any i've found right yeah that's nice to have anything that'll show both sides to something and uh try their best to dedicate you know equal space here and there for an issue yeah yeah uh but you know the funny thing the history of newspapers uh i was kind of amazed uh not being a real historian buff i i listened to a program one time on uh i believe it was Larry King Live was had an old newspaper guy on there and he was saying that uh the history of newspapers were to be a hundred percent biased that's all they were were that guys opinion he owned the press and he could say what he wanted and he got politicians in office and he did everything he wanted to and people knew it people knew that you know this person put out this kind of print and that's what they said that's what they felt yeah uh and then they slowly you you know out of public cry changed a little bit toward being a little more unbiased hm that's interesting but that their origin was uh a hundred percent you know i want to present this view and that's what the newspaper did along with a few other tidbits of obituaries and pure factual things to be biased yeah but the majority of comment was sheerly sheerly editorial and and had bold faced lies in print just to get the point across you know isn't that interesting and uh he was he was giving the history of several politicians that were made made and broken by that uh process there and i i kind of a sad commentary though when you think about it yeah yeah that uh that that kind of power was was was at one time flourishing in this country it is right right and it's it's such a valuable tool and and their should be some moral uh you know there's so many people to be duped yes yes there's still a lot of people that believe if it's in print it's gospel yes yeah that's right that's right but uh that's too bad really yeah it is it's kind of uh TV they mentioned TV radio and newspaper as just uh uh and then friends and the like i still get a little bit of my information from magazines uh especially if it's a technical nature and professional nature as it were yeah uh if you're going to catch up on what the latest developments are mechanical design wise or car wise or anything like that yeah that that's true that's good source of really good information usually and i guess the housekeeping realm still gets its main articles from the Good Housekeeping style magazines yeah yeah i think that's right so i think that's true especially as fast as they can print these things these days some of my stuff comes every two weeks and then it's a lot of material yeah yeah yeah well that's true be awful if you couldn't read isn't it i've i've learned to appreciate that i've had some eye problems in the last four or five years and there are times when i couldn't read for one reason or another and it's a real it's a it's awful yes that's true the so the printed the printed or whatever word is really a valuable thing to us even though sometimes it may be slanted i think you need to learn to think and understand that you have to interpret and stand up for yourself decide what you think and make decisions um-hum well i'm calling here from work and i've got another call coming in so i'd better let you go okay bye all right good to talk to you um-hum bye now  do you have some kids getting ready for college well i have uh uh basically have grown children i've got one that's that is a part-time college student and one that's college age but not attending so uh he did it you've sort of faced up to the problem then yeah he he did uh attend a little bit you know they took some classes and then decided it college was not what he wanted to do so yeah he went along the the older one the daughter who is older is going part-time and working full time uh-huh uh she's attending a community college right now and she would like to go on to a you know to a four year school go ahead and get a degree yes and uh that's you know one of her immediate long range objectives well i've got a bunch of little ones that are still growing up yeah uh so i'm sort of facing putting them through college about the time i'm also looking to retire oh yeah so you and uh uh i think my initial thoughts are going to have to sort of grade my advice according to uh you know how much motivation and drive and uh and ability they have when they start facing the college years right uh i i guess uh one thing from from my own personal experience uh the drive is the important or is i i consider to be the important part of going to college um i i was not an exceptional student by any means in high school i was not a bad student but was not an exceptional student and you know didn't really have uh any strong ambitions that required college but i did want to go to school did want to get the you know go ahead and get the college uh-huh and so i worked my way through college and uh you know i think that it was because i really wanted the degree that i you know followed through and went ahead and and went on even finished up going to college after i got married uh-huh and uh i like you said i think that uh the ambition and the drive is uh is pretty much key a key there yeah uh like i said we've got the one that's not going to college he he just does not have the desire to go at this time are i hope that some day for my benefit i hope that some day he decides he wants to go because it will you know make me feel better but uh whatever makes him feel best is what's important i suppose yeah well i think my reaction from my experience is that uh i picked a school that was too good uh-huh and uh so i had a fairly tough time getting through and they presented me with a lot of material which i just wasn't able to absorb and handle yeah and i i think that that's and uh so i think my first advice would be to go to a community college and to a a smaller school for your undergraduate studies maybe a state supported school and then if you have the necessary drive and still need the the intellectual mileage to pick a top of the line school for graduate study uh-huh i think that's a good idea uh and and too i guess uh looking at at what the the individuals interests are instead of just what uh what the popular degree plans are uh right i uh started out in in high school expecting to go into engineering and when i got into the mathematics and science classes i was not a bad student in those in those areas but didn't really have the interest in it so i changed my my career design over into the accounting and business field and uh i am a CPA uh-huh and i you know i'm pretty good at that but i it's not it was not something that i really thought long and hard and had a real you know a real strong drive toward um i'm not sure what uh what i would have done differently or what i would do differently now but uh i might you know i might go in a different direction if i were to start fresh uh you know think more about what my real interest were instead of what my you know instead of what was available or what sounded like a good money maker uh it's not always the important thing you know i think one it's very important to chose a career that uh to do something you enjoy doing right because i figure that's part of my compensation is is being able to do something i can take an interest in yeah uh i think one of the reactions i had uh was that i underestimated the amount of math that was needed for an engineering degree right uh you know my interest uh in high school was you know grabbing up a bunch of vacuum tubes and and building something that worked uh-huh and uh you know it was a matter of using cookbook designs and so forth and building up amplifiers or oscillators or making transmitters or receivers and uh you know i didn't face up to the fact that there's a you know an enormous mathematical basis for all of this right until i actually got to college and so it was a bit of a slap in the face and an uphill struggle although i didn't have that much trouble with math uh in high school noise yeah um an i guess another another area that uh in retrospect i would give parents a real strong advice on is the the study habits and preparation that students need uh-huh and and they need to start as early as they can you know not wait until they're a freshman in high school even to start developing good study habits and get the you know get the good basics uh you know the math and the the English and a little science and stuff like that that that uh so they really have a good background for whatever course load they're going to take yeah because uh i know in in my son's case his math background is is not very strong and we tried a lot you know to to help him but i think that the uh i think the educational system uh-huh uh the way things are are run in this area anyway it it's a little weak and you know as a result he doesn't he doesn't have the math background that he would need in college right and uh i think that's one reason that he's not interested he doesn't think he would do well well i was fairly lucky in uh going to a small town school uh i got a lot of individual attention from the the faculty that was there uh-huh they probably weren't the most brilliant people in the world but they uh were very personable and took uh a interest in people who were willing to study yeah uh i agree i think that makes a difference uh and so i i went to a small town school also my son went to a school that had like twenty five hundred students in it or something you know we have yeah yeah you get lost there and uh it's it's really well it really makes a difference as to there were thirty six students in my graduating class uh-huh uh but they you know we had a math instructor there and when i asked him questions about calculus and so forth he was incapable of handling it you know algebra was fine but you know if you asked him about differential equations or or something like that he didn't know what you were talking about uh-huh uh and when i went to take solid geometry i had to uh commute to a a larger town to Allentown Pennsylvania to take uh solid geometry an d the instructor there was was sharp enough to know or to realize that i was good at mathematical concepts but i had one lingering flaw left over from grade school and that was that i hadn't learned to add subtract multiply and divide correctly yeah and that that does make a difference that's what like i was saying you know you get those basics behind you to start with you know get a good foundation in uh those core type courses right and it it will carry you a long way if you know the the concepts and the the logic and just understanding what the what's expected of you uh-huh really makes a lot of difference in you know what you're capable of doing so yes all right well it's been nice talking to you yeah it's been nice i hope they got what they wanted on it well at least you have some some words they can parse there right okay take care i'll talk to you later maybe thanks bye  tell me what books you read oh boy well um i haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately i read uh one book a friend recommended to me i can't even remember the guy's name it was a science fiction Dean Cole or something like that and it was so frightening and it had so much violence in it i just could hardly stand it yeah i didn't think it was so great she thought it was riveting you know but i couldn't deal with that but um um i try to avoid the mostly i read i'm a marriage and family counselor and mostly i read things to do with raising kids and now i have two little kids or codependency or you know fifty thousand things like John Bradshaw's books on uh The Family and uh-huh um-hum Homecoming and Inner Child and so i read usually that kind of stuff if and right now i'm reading um Judith Viorst's book called Necessary Losses where she talks about different losses that we've had in our lives that we have to get past if we're going to mature and um-hum so in my in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a half year old i i read yes that's really changed my reading habits because i used to read so much especially when i was in school that does cut into your reading time a lot yeah you know but gosh it's uh it's getting pathetic now if i get through a magazine i've been well my my kids are up and out of the house now so you know i'll uh encourage you that you do get uh a little more time to yourself later on i won't say lots yeah later you're probably looking for your kids so you can talk to them when they're out running around with friends yeah what do you read yeah oh uh well i read for a living uh i'm an editor you do oh oh how interesting what kind of books and so i i'm at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and therefore i read uh psychology sociology anthropology political science philosophy linguistics history uh um oh my goodness yeah and you name it i've read some of it yeah well that sounds like a fascinating job it really is it it's a great place to be and the uh it's nice to work with people uh who yeah are not required to use your services and so therefore are grateful and not arguing you with you about them if they don't want an editor they don't come yeah that's true that's true well you probably i i seem to remember that uh little byline on a lot of things i've read um is is is that um do they have a mail hum kind of campaign that they send to professionals in the social no no we don't uh normally we don't publish uh things under our own imprint uh hum that sounds so familiar we have had books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different uh commercial and academic publishers and university presses um-hum so uh i end up sometimes reading the things that are written here all the way through sometimes just a few chapters because that's as far as they get yeah but i also get of course lots of references to neat stuff to read about yeah so i'm uh i was just thinking when they told me the topic i should just i should read the uh titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that i'm in the middle of yeah i'm reading uh Within the Plantation Household which is a history uh sort of a sociological history of southern women black and white living on plantations oh that sounds interesting yeah uh a book called Poisons of the Past which is about ergotisms that uh fungus that grows on rye oh it causes the uh uh Saint Anthony's Fire Disease where people fell into fits and i thought that was going to be some oh oh my goodness there is a a theory at least that a lot of people who were accused of witchcraft were actually under the influence of ergot huh and a book called Job Cues Gender Cues which explains uh how certain professions and vocations get uh flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other like uh nursing um-hum nursing or started out all men and then in the nineteenth century began to have women and now it's practically all women yeah secretaries i bet that used to be mostly men who were secretaries of any type for business and that uh that's right and the thing that changed that was the manual typewriter yeah oh but then it became you see just sort of a clerical task whereas when you wrote it out in long hand you were a yeah then you were important yes you were a confidential assistant to the person yeah yeah like the scribes who did the old documents you know for churches and right and stuff yeah that's interesting and then i've got a book called Fashions in Science which is a sociology that explains uh why certain theories get to be popular in uh sociology and uh how difficult it is to swim against the tide if you have a different idea that isn't vatted by your peers um-hum and then i have one novel that's called First Light that's about uh archeology hum the British novel so it's it's really quite interesting i haven't got too far into it yet gosh really so are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts that have not been published uh those are all books that are out uh published and bound now but they're just things that huh uh pertain to various things i'm working on or were uh mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity so i got them out of the library and decided i'd read some more in them yeah my goodness well that's fascinating gosh so i read a lot of history and uh a few novels an occasional mystery stories just for fun um-hum yeah yeah i never have gotten into any of the romantic novels or any of that kind of stuff my husband reads a lot of the um well he did before we had kids the Star Trek and all those kind of sci-fi kinds of things you know um-hum oh yeah yeah you really he's got a quite a collection of those but uh my stuff revolves uh revolves revolves around uh one hundred one thousand let's see i've got one called One Thousands Practical Parenting Tips which teaches you to put elastic instead of shoelaces in your kid's shoes hey i've done that to every pair my three year old has oh hey that's a nifty idea great you know really and uh oh i think the the boom to parents and the the shoelace department was those little Velcro tabs i think that's inc redibly oh yeah yeah but there's a surprising number that are still around that aren't that don't have those so that's an alternate means of dealing with but um i'm trying to think of what else i've got uh um-hum since i'm um a therapist and all i've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups so i've got all the different alcoholics what they call the blue the blue book the big book yeah and all the OA literature and all the CODA literature so i'm trying to get familiarized more familiarized with that because i refer clients and different groups and uh um-hum well let's see i'm trying to think of the what do you think is the most promising or practical book uh of that kind yo u've read recently um oh i definitely i have a a love affair with John Bradshaw i just have found everything i've read of his to be fabulous hum um he started out with one called The Family which does the family systems and people's roles in the family and then he did uh Healing Healing the Shame that Binds You about how shame can just be so paralyzing and people isolate and withdraw and then the third one that he came out with is now called Homecoming uh and uh there's a subtitle to it i never can remember what it is it's something like um A Journey um-hum In Your Inner Child or something like that yeah i knew his literary agent in Houston when she was just uh convincing him to write all this down he was teaching oh he's just great and now he's had the the first the first one and the third one put into a ten session uh PBS series yeah i saw i saw one of those episodes on PBS uh from time to time out here we have four different PBS channels that we can get on the cable yeah oh and they'll have all ten of those shown back to back in the middle of the night for people can video tape them i know yeah so people can just tape them i guess you know but i definitely have gotten a lot out of his lately he's just probably been one of the most there's an author that's in um yeah that's in uh Arizona who used to be in Dallas it seems like we have a lot of these that have been in Texas called PM Melody who does a lot of writing on codependency and she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and uh um-hum hm a workbook called Breaking Free and just some real uh helpful practical things for codependency so that's been another one that i've thought was real helpful but um-hum other than that uh my reading centers on Paddington Bear and Winnie the Pooh and Doctor Seuss oh yes oh but i really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because there's so much more uh new things out that you know i i'd pull out the classics once in a while for my kids but there's such cute things out for kids oh there's some absolutely wonderful illustrated children's books oh i know and i just go to the library because i just they're expensive i mean it and they go through them so fast you know yeah um-hum so i just i really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out and they just love to sit and read and now finally the littlest one is old enough to to sit you know and watch the pictures instead of grabbing it and trying to rip the pages out exactly right uh well so that has been fun to do that you know go through the children's literature and uh i read the Publisher's Weekly uh which lists all the upcoming books forthcoming books and uh uh-huh there are so many that look like they would just be absolutely wonderful but i was tickled to see that some publisher is uh reprinting those the James Thurber books for children oh wonderful the Wonderful O and The Thirteen Clocks that have been out of print for about oh i think about twenty years gosh really well i'm going to have to look for those yeah well i had those for my kids and they really did enjoy them oh yeah yeah oh but they were old copies then i didn't buy them when my kids were little and so they probably were out of print all of already when my kids were small but yeah yeah um i was really happy to see that yeah i guess it's in honor of his hundredth  okay what kind of vacations do you participate in well well when we were kids we went to uh Mexico a couple of times uh-huh and we went to Carlsbad Caverns and uh Alamo uh-huh and Oklahoma um-hum and since then i've gone to uh well i went to Mexico on one trip and i went to Lake Caddo uh-huh and uh have you ever been on a cruise before uh no no nothing like that no uh would would you like to go on one do you think no i don't think so because because uh i like to fish oh and i camp out and stuff like that well they sure are a lot of fun they sure do a lot uh good eating yeah uh-huh if you like to eat that's the place to go that's one one to go on i i it's the best eating in the world yeah oh yeah oh i mean it's nonstop the minute you get on the ship until you get off you can start eating and you can eat all night long if you want fantastic i'm going to go to Europe in the in the Fall um-hum and i'm really looking forward to that i've always wanted to go and i have a friend that's a uh flight attendant for American and her route is London to Dallas so she wants to go see England just because she just flies in and flies out so she she knows London but she doesn't know the rest so we're going to go to Wales and Scotland and England i think that'll be fun is that in the Spring that this Summer uh we're going in the Fall September October oh yeah uh-huh and uh i think that'd be great plus like i say i like i like cruises i'm going with my sister-in-law i'm going on a cruise next summer uh for about seven days and uh i'd i haven't decided i've been to the Bahamas but i think i'd like to try the uh the Mexico one this year the Cozumel and um-hum Puerto Vallarta and that that route around like that i believe this next time but the Bahama one was nice and if that's one of the cruise we can get on i i'll take it again because it was really a lot of fun and the water's real clear down there oh just crystal absolutely crystal clear the fish are just beautiful and if you like snorkeling um-hum yeah oh just you just can't beat it i i love to snorkel and the the beaches are just snow white absolutely snow white have you ever been to the west coast of Florida um no just to Galveston oh well the west coast of Florida all all those beaches are snow white like that um-hum um-hum and the east coast you have to get down to Miami before they're any you know before they're snow white but the west coast is just beautiful um-hum and i i go i moved here from Florida a couple of years ago back from i was living in Texas i went to Florida and came back and uh oh i'm going to retire down there one of these years and it's going to be in on the west coast of Florida because it's so gorgeous yeah the sand sand is just out of this and it's just like sugar powdered sugar around uh oh Venice Beach and Clearwater especially has beautiful beautiful snow white sand um-hum it's really nice but i grew up in Colorado so i don't care for the mountains too much hum uh and California i'm a native Californian and they have mountains there my mother lives up in northern California they're nice to visit and i didn't enjoy growing up in the mountains and i'd rather go to the sun than i would to the to the mountains i mean they're all right i don't like it because i have to go now see to see me mother i have to go to the the the mountains yeah but if i didn't have to if i didn't have to go i would never go did you ever go to Yosemite yes that's pretty isn't it yeah it is and i've been to uh of course i grew up in Colorado where it was really mountainous and beautiful um-hum hum yeah but uh when i go back and visit it i'm really disappointed it it it doesn't uh i remember it as a child and it's nothing like what i remembered as a child it's so commercialized and i it really um-hum made me got kind of turn my stomach when i went back and saw how commercialized it had gotten but yeah i'm not a camper outer so i you know i if you like to camp out so that's fine but i i don't want to camp out i like the luxuries too much i guess i'm spoiled i am spoiled yeah and i spoil myself i guess so i and then in in Colorado it's mostly streams and they've dammed up some of them now so yeah yeah it just so you don't Colorado just doesn't really show me anything anymore so um-hum now my where my mother lives in northern California is absolutely gorgeous i mean just yeah picture postcard gorgeous and it it you know it just out of sight but uh it's too uh i've got to be by a big city i i can't stand living that far away i fly up into Oregon and drive down to her house um-hum and uh so she's really way up there and it it i just it's just too far away from a a big city for me i got to have a shopping malls and what have you and northern California really is out in the boondocks isn't it oh boy she is in it's it's a good twelve hour hour drive just from San Francisco on winding winding winding river roads um-hum and it's way on up past the wine country and everything is like i say it's really gorgeous but but you fly in through Portland then no Medford Oregon oh they have a airport there uh-huh yeah and then drive down it's about an oh an hour hour and a half's drive from Medford Oregon but it's all mountain driving um-hum and fortunately my sister picks me up i don't have to drive it yeah tried driving it once from San Francisco and that was a that was very dumb i'll never try that again they have a they they have a coast highway there don't they or well this uh where my mother lives is uh it kind of in the middle of the state up north so um-hum they're about uh an hour or two drive from the ocean for the coast so you could go up that way but it would be out it would be out of your way better from from to go to her house at like up through Redding and on up that way um-hum and uh how far is it from Tahoe oh gosh i don't know four hours i think four no i can't remember i seem like it's eight hours somebody somebody told me it may be it may be twelve so i can't remember mine i know my son went from Tahoe to over to their house so and he knows that i i never have gone there so um-hum i don't know master the mountains too yeah it really like i say it really is gorgeous um-hum uh i uh i like the sunshine better i mean i'd rather go out where there's beaches and i don't i like to sun bathe and uh you know it's getting so dangerous now the sun bathe or the sun burns and cancer skin cancer and everything so i load up you know on the sunscreens and so i because the ocean to me is real soothing and comforting comforting yeah and so that's why i like to to go there but and of course i don't like uh i like uh i like to snorkel so i have to go where there's real clear water to do that yeah and around here the uh the Possum Kingdom is about the the closest place is it really uh yeah they have real clear water and plants oh i've never been now where is that near it's uh near um well it's it's kind of near Abilene but it's it's uh about halfway in between here and and Abilene oh okay it's uh you if you know where Albany is then uh it's about maybe an hour west of Weatherford oh okay out there west of Fort Worth uh-huh uh-huh it's a big it's on the Brazos River they dammed up the Brazos River oh i see i see and it's beautiful is it no i i guess i've never been up there my my when i moved up here uh uh uh from Florida i i misplaced my snorkeling i think they what they did they didn't unpack it it must have been in a box or something they didn't unpack because i ended up without my snorkeling equipment and and a few other things and they must have been in a box that i had in my garage and they just didn't get them to me so um-hum i'm going to have to start from scratch i guess and buy all new snorkeling equipment but i had some really good snorkeling equipment i really hate to start over again but there's no other choice choice but yeah anyway have we talked our five minutes yeah i think so okay well it's been nice talking to you yeah nice talking to you bye-bye uh-huh bye-bye  all right well uh quite a few and they're varied they don't uh uh encompass uh many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing uh-huh but i do uh quite a bit of wreath making and my dogs are my hobbies i do a lot of gardening i go to estate sales which takes up a lot of time uh-huh now what do you mostly do well mostly right now i'm a i do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible we're uh we're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff so oh boy that should be fun yeah yeah fun for them yeah how old are they uh i've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three well i think that's better than having that party at home yeah well uh this is a friend's party and they they rented or you know they the party they uh just rent skates and stuff for the kids so uh they're they're looking forward to it yeah and the the the skating rink does the rest practically i guess boy what a help that is yeah yeah uh-huh yeah so uh how long have you lived in North Carolina what kind of well not that long uh just since October we moved here from Enid Oklahoma really oh uh-huh so uh we are we're originally from Virginia this part of the country but we did spend twenty years in Norman and Enid and loved it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh but we needed to get back uh to our older parents yeah uh-huh but i am loving it the weather is divine really yes was uh did you like Oklahoma while you were there oh yes very much yeah um what did you all do well my husband was with uh University of Oklahoma and Phillips University in Enid and then he went with uh a family corporation that had uh has oil and ranching uh-huh uh-huh and varied enterprises uh-huh and uh he just quit a perfectly good job and came we came East yes really so is uh is he working there then or yes uh-huh he's doing uh quite a bit of consulting work and has been offered a permanent position and he's contemplating he he's liking this free time actually oh uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah it's just wonderful after all these years of working yeah yeah well how did how did you get uh hooked up with the TI switchboard thing um a gal who works uh with TI on this project i think she's a temporary worker uh mother is my best friend in Virginia so uh-huh oh i see i see we have spread the word a little bit in this part of the country uh-huh well i my wife has talked more than i have uh she's talked to four five different people it seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from Dallas in fact she's talked to a couple of people from North Carolina i think yeah really uh what is her name her name's Tina yeah well i haven't talked to her i haven't i haven't talked to a Tina yet yeah uh-huh well uh the the call was probably for her they wouldn't accept my uh T I N number so we put hers in but uh uh like i said we're getting getting the kids ready to go to the birthday party so but uh yeah yeah some what yeah i i've only talked to one or two and they've they've all been in Dallas but she hasn't talked to anybody in Dallas yet so that's interesting yeah yeah well you haven't told me uh what sports that you are active in well the sport i like best probably is basketball but uh i guess i'm probably better at softball and so i'd like during the summer months it's occupies quite a bit of my time but yes i play in a couple of leagues and and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend but my family usually goes with me we try to do everything we can together well i think that's uh easy entertainment for a family too yeah yeah well they uh a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams we uh that's usually the team i play on with the tournaments and stuff and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age so they play together pretty well and under the stands under the bleachers yeah yeah pretty much and uh Tina enjoys uh the other lady real well so they you know that's kind of nice it's like getting together with them so to speak uh-huh yes well it's getting a little hot isn't it it yeah well it's been raining a lot here so far so we haven't really had any kind of real heat i think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in in the house so it looks like an air conditioner day but yeah it sure does or maybe this evening anyway yeah it yeah but you know i'm sure you're familiar with that living here we go we go through Enid you know quite a bit we go to Tulsa from time to time and my my parents live in southern Illinois so we drive up there and very much so yeah well lots lot of times we take seventy five and uh it seems like seems like that goes through Enid i know i've either seen the signs or no no it doesn't Enid is uh it's in the northwest it's uh directly across the straight uh state from Tulsa um i know i've seen the sign somewhere yeah uh sure you have yes well Enid is not uh an unknown little city it uh right an awful lot of people know where it is or have been there and it was uh a very uh self-sufficient uh wealthy uh town for a long time anyway uh-huh uh uh-huh you know until uh everything happened the bottom fell out oh uh-huh but it's beginning to do well but there's a lot of uh old time wealth there that has helped to stabilize things oh uh-huh uh-huh so uh how long you said you've just lived in North Carolina just like six months then is since yes something like that oh and you really like it there huh i've heard so many people talk about that area i've never been there but they sure say it's pretty well it's it's pretty the weather is wonderful uh this winter we it was just we had so many wonderful days and uh uh-huh i if it got to be forty degrees i decided it was too cold to to walk the dogs isn't funny how how your standards change uh-huh yeah yeah it really does my wife and i spent a couple years uh doing church work up in the state of Washington right on the coast yes and it rains you know a lot there but you get used to it i mean it's like a fine mist all the time and it doesn't really it gets to where it doesn't bother you sure well Carolina this part is very much like that too very foggy and misty the moss grows on the trees in the woods up eight ten feet rea lly it uh-huh right right yeah that's the way it is was there too yeah i think however that's like February uh i know it did it all February and some people said to me well that's our wintertime oh uh-huh but well i know you need to go and i've enjoyed talking to you well i have enjoyed talking to you too it was nice to talk to you thanks so much have a i hope you enjoy North Carolina oh thank you and i hope you enjoy and get through that birthday party yeah well i hope i live through it that's what i hope okay thanks a lot good-bye yeah i do too bye-bye  we're supposed to talk about dining what kind of dining do you like to do well we're in the Dallas area are you also uh-huh yeah grapevine yeah yeah i'm in Grapevine uh Fort Worth Dallas area pardon uh-huh well we uh we don't do a lot of family dining out uh but but my husband and i do uh-huh we do all kinds of different things so was that you yes can you believe that oh okay well i just didn't know if i needed to go and whoop up on my kids quick or whatever no i just let it go oh okay uh it'll they'll call back well the uh my husband and i used to try to go out like one evening of a weekend or something uh-huh and sometimes we'll even go during the daytime for lunch oh that's nice so if we have the opportunity just because it's quieter yeah yeah we don't like the bar atmosphere yeah they usually stick you in there for an hour you know or even when there are plenty of tables that always makes me mad that just to get you to buy drinks i guess and uh-huh now i don't mind waiting thirty minutes but boy if it gets over thirty minutes it really irritates me yeah and we aren't drinkers so you know for us that's just kind of wasted time time we just but now we do go to this one little place out here on the expressway uh Cheddars yeah uh-huh yeah i and they have a uh i ate there Friday as a matter of fact at lunch um-hum um-hum well they have a big screen TV yeah in Dallas the one in Fort Worth oh okay in their bar area lounge area and we don't mind that because we both love basketball and like to watch basketball uh-huh but i uh oh i don't like the fights and stuff and sometimes you see those yeah but and if if it's a wild and crazy music that turns us off too me too me too but we uh yeah i like uh there's not too many restaurants i don't like to go to i just i just like to eat out but i uh we do too we we do too i i wish we could do more often i imagine when all our kids get gone and grown that we'll yeah you will mine are mine are grown and gone in fact i'm going over tonight to my son's house he's taking me out tonight for Mother's Day and then my i'm going to brunch in the morning with my daughter for Mother's for Mother's Day uh so how fun how fun i'll have of course i'm on a diet but i guess i'll go off of it for this weekend well don't you think though there are a lot more options available for people who are watching yeah and you know you you know you're seeing a lot more grilled chicken and fish without breading on it and right yeah absolutely and that's you know i never hesitate ever anymore to ask for my dressing on the side or to eliminate sour cream or anything like that and they're always willing to help and accommodate yeah yeah they are and i really even all the fast foods they're coming out with the grilled chicken and i eat a lot of those you know and even if i yeah yeah i i don't eat steak too much i love steak and i have to have it every every now and then but normally i'm i i try and stay away from the red the red meats if i go to a steak house i will eat one but i don't you know gorge myself yeah yeah i love steak too and you know a lot of times we'll our favorite place to eat for steak is Steak and Ale it yeah now i've never gotten a bad meal there have you i just you know they're consistently good hum-um no no and just always you know always quiet and pleasant and yeah they're uh i i found that if you call and make reservations oh i uh you they used to irritate me making us wait so long but uh now i found if i call and make reservations they usually get you in pretty fast so um-hum um-hum oh the uh uh one out here is just always very accommodating you know we like a lot of ethnic foods too we we like to go different places and uh-huh i do too well i love Chinese i love oriental food and i love seafood and uh but i also like i i don't mind paying for atmosphere yep yeah i don't either i i it doesn't bother me at all and uh if i and i don't and i'm not opposed to tipping very well if i if the service is good but boy i it really irritates me to well like in Cheddars yesterday i know that the girl just forgot our order and we were on a lunch hour you know and my gosh she just you waiting and waiting and waiting and i know i thought gosh my whole lunch hour i'm just sitting here waiting here for a lousy sandwich so i went ahead and tipped her but i didn't want to was mad yeah and you know that that's part of their wage and that they get busy and stuff you but but you wouldn't tip as much as you would have had yes i know it right yeah right but that that and i do i tip accordingly oh believe me i if the you know the uh i do too i think that that's service related and you know i do too but i hate cheap people that that get good service and don't tip that irritates me just as bad and i've been out with guys that have embarrassed me that don't tip yeah yeah you know well i it really uh makes you want to just kind of slip a little more under there yeah it really and i have i have slipped money you know if if the guy didn't tip enough i'll take money out of my purse but a yeah yeah and i hope it makes them feel bad but i don't think it does no probably not they figure i guess they figure that's your choice well uh i know uh my i have teenagers and just recently i was out with a group of teenagers for semester exams uh-huh uh if i said i would provide transportation at lunchtime for them to go and out to eat and uh-huh so all these little kids here they all want their own tickets you know yeah and i said right up front now kids actually i kind of said it to my daughter and if i was going to do it again i would say it to the whole group because i was too uh i was i was too shy i didn't not too shy i just didn't want to embarrass her okay uh-huh but what happened was i ended up having to loan money to those kids because they did not figure in the tip and the tax oh did you really um-hum um-hum they looked at that and said three ninety five they say i got four dollars i can do this and they thought that really yeah yeah you know so they buy the get the three ninety five item and you know then they didn't have enough for the extra so and i found the also that uh i don't think that waitresses i yeah i was in a survey when i lived in Orlando uh had a was in a survey of restaurants and uh the i a lot of the waiters and waitresses think you know when women come in that that women are lousy tippers and that's why they don't give them as good a service as they do a couple or something like that but i don't think that's true i think women just that you know a single woman an individual of any kind is not going to have as large an order to me right as two or three at a table well i find that women are more willing to give a good tip a bunch of women as sure uh couples or or you know guys together probably yeah i don't think they're that but that they were on this survey they were saying that the that's the notion that women have i mean that waitress and waitresses had but uh well i i yeah i definitely disagree with that i like one of my favorites in Dallas is uh Baby Doe's you have you ever eaten there um-hum been a long time been a long time oh yeah i love it oh gosh it's i like the atmosphere i remember when they first opened up i we went several times and uh it was it was so much fun but i like i said i like to go to restaurants like that i and i like these um have you ever been to what when i lived in Orlando they had call a place called Shakespeare's and they probably have one similar to it here where medieval um-hum uh-huh the medieval yeah those are kind of fun i wouldn't want a steady diet of it but kind of uh a tavern pub kind of thing yeah and have the wenches wait on you um-hum it was a lot of fun i i enjoyed that we uh we were at the butcher shop in the West End here recently and that was sure neat it cook your own steak and those steaks were wonderful uh-huh yeah where you cook your own steak yeah yeah yeah weren't they i i've eaten there that was that's good but it was uh i really enjoyed that i remember back when that was just old warehouses down there i couldn't believe when i moved back to Dallas how that had changed yeah exactly exactly same here i grew up in the area yeah i remember i think Spaghetti Warehouse was about the only thing down there for years and years some of my favorite ones have i guess it kind of grew around it well i moved from in eighty five when i came back all that was uh built back up had all been worked over yeah and i thought you know Deep Ellum i still don't think i'd go to Deep Ellum i don't care how chic it's supposed to be but well there's some wonderful little shops and art art galleries and is it really i just could i just from back in the fifties i remember how bad it was and i just it just stuck in my mind and i just wouldn't go down there i don't think especially at night i might during the day but i don't think i'd go at night down there at all because it used to really be rough and tough in fact the only time i ever saw anybody stabbed out we were driving down in the street and saw a guy come out of a theater with a knife sticking out of his back and that just is stuck in my mind and he was walking too uh they were walking him to an ambulance ooh and i just i've never gone back since then that was enough to take it no that's right i don't want to go down there anymore well i think that's those kind of things definitely tend to mark your uh yeah but Dallas has really got a lot of good restaurants they really do i think Dallas is a very uh up and coming area i think it's uh yeah they just it it caters to a lot of business groups and a lot of out of towners and and regulars also and you know uh-huh yeah are you a native Dallasite uh i came here when i was in elementary school so i consider myself native okay well i married a Dallasite and that's how i got here but i would you know i wouldn't trade for it i i'm from California but i i just consider myself a Texan when i moved to Florida i couldn't hardly wait to get back well i stayed down there four years i think uh you know that uh i think Dallas is becoming diverse enough now to accommodate almost any need yeah i think so or any desires in any kind of cooking you know Indian Greek you name it you know there's there's something for everybody and yeah um-hum um-hum i'm enjoying living over here in Grapevine and Fort Worth area too for for a change because i'm really discovering Fort Worth they've got a lot of nice restaurants over here that a lot of people don't know about you know our favorite one in Fort Worth is downtown Fort Worth kind of across from the uh The Keg The Keg is it down there by Sundance Square The Keg well it's down you know by the Convention Center yeah i i i don't know what the street is i'm not real familiar with down there i've been down there to the Sundance Square when i first uh moved back here i met my sister-in-law sister-in-law down there and uh  all right wasn't the Mayor of New York um arrested for cocaine abuse or was it somebody else no that was DC yeah it was Mayor of DC DC i couldn't figure out if well Koch is New York isn't he okay yes he is but it was uh Mayor Berry uh yeah but my i i guess my feeling on drug testing in the work place i am one hundred percent for it yeah Berry oh i am too yeah so we got nothing to disagree about you are um yeah i know and um it it i a lot of people you know have a problem with the random testing like why should i be tested and that person not tested but the point is is that nobody should they can't test everybody right and that you know it's it's it's illegal i mean maybe if drugs were legal then this would be all different but drugs are illegal and therefore it shouldn't be it it should be the law that we're able to test for something that is illegal right well right and most of your work places it can be dangerous if somebody's drugged using drugs that's for sure especially school i don't think there should be any kind of limits set on school officials being tested um-hum um-hum i agree bus driver you know that commercial with the you know they show a woman doing cocaine or something and then you think it doesn't affect you and then you see her she's driving the school bus right yes oh i love that commercial i know that one's really powerful it pulls at you but you know it's true um not even the interaction with people like one on one but well i guess this relates to the school bus but people in warehouses that are driving forklifts you know that um uh-huh there there could be some serious accidents i know it just well and like at TI do you work at TI that's really that's a shame no i don't okay well at TI you're messing with all of those chemicals and stuff and if you mix the wrong chemicals or whatever it can put out toxic fumes yeah what is the policy at TI do you have to be drug tested or well um i worked there for a while Manpower employee and i was tested before i even started oh that's where i work i work at Manpower yeah you do yeah where are you working at then well i i work for Manpower i mean i'm a surv i supervise the office yeah huh so you were a a temporary working at TI oh neat oh okay uh uh-huh and i well i quit when i found out i was pregnant i was just really scared of messing with the chemicals oh yeah i don't blame you and uh TI is strict on their chemicals but they don't really um i don't know i just wasn't didn't feel safe messing around it um-hum but you had to be drug tested before you could work the oh yeah before yeah Manpower did it so um-hum that's interesting um here you know Kodak is the the big name in Rochester Kodak what is that what is that oh the film the company i'm sorry what is Kodak Kodak yeah the film right no it's okay but um i mean in Rochester everything is Kodak but you know but half the population here works for Kodak and um usually they set the trends and originally um it was only the people that were working in the industrial type of facilities facilities that needed to be drug tested because they felt that if they were using drugs they would be the most dangerous versus office type workers who probably uh-huh i don't know you know what they they never saw what sort of um you know problem they could have if they were using drugs i guess i don't know but um just in nineteen i guess it was nineteen eighty nine they started testing everybody so now anybody whether you want to go in and work in the cafeteria or be can they spot test you yes they can but they can't do it more than once a year i think you you can't be tested more than once a year okay hum would they spot test at TI yeah they'll do it anytime i'm i'm not sure what limits they set on it but i know that you had like eight hours to go in and do it between the time you were told and the time you had to go be tested yeah um-hum oh well um-hum that's good well um the thing you know you brought up about Mayor Berry i uh you've probably seen the clip on the news the one where he's um uh-huh going into that room and and making the deal with somebody did you see that well the you know he got right he got acquitted or whatever the term is but the yeah that he was um the charges were removed that to me is so acquitted it's political oh i know and it's so absurd because now kids are going to see that and say oh look he got off the hook i'll get off the hook too you know yeah well in that uh book that Kitty Kitty whatever wrote saying that President Reagan can you see the President being tested no he wouldn't be tested yeah right oh i know yeah that's true which i don't know how true that is but i thought that was kind of funny yeah but really well i think everybody should i think it should become just a a standard law but well even office workers i mean you could play with computers and lose what all kinds of information if you're just not careful i'm not even uh sure yeah that's true all that great with computers but i know just one mistake you can lose the whole record or i can't even remember the word program yeah um-hum um-hum program yeah but um i think that your point about schools is um probably the first place to start because they're the ones that are influencing the new generation you know that are going to become the people working in those companies yeah well when i first started looking for work there wasn't any drug testing and i'm twenty six now and it seems like they've always every every job you go for you have to be tested um-hum um-hum yeah so i think i think that's good see i've never used drugs personally so um-hum no me either and i don't really want to be under the influence of somebody that is especially i could see a supervisor going nuts because well they do go freak out over anything you know right oh i know it's crazy it makes me so upset to hear about all these movie stars and you know TV stars that have gone through some sort of rehabilitation and because um um-hum i guess those those those people are so glorified you know they're the the the sitcoms on TV that's like perfection and then to find out that um uh Michael J Fox you know went through three years of using cocaine you right he did i didn't know that yeah he did i just read an article about that um it it just shatters my whole feeling about him and and then i just think about the kids that glorify him or the you know just idealize him or whoever right well most of the kids growing up in entertainment business do have troubles because they're in on the fast lane or whatever yeah yeah and they have the money you know they don't have to worry about where they're going to get the money to pay for it yeah where they're going to get the money to do it right but even if you don't have the money people that really want drugs will finds the money somehow unfortunately yeah while i was in college uh college i did a a paper on that just how many people most of the people criminals has got drug problems you know it's just one of the major um-hum reasons they're out to break into peoples houses and whatever yeah um-hum right exactly exactly it takes over i even um i forget if it was 60 Minutes or something where people in jail are even getting drugs oh yeah but that's always been going on i i know and isn't that insane i mean how does that happen it just doesn't make since to me well from watching TV they'll put it in the the women'll put it in their bras or in their mouth and kiss the men or whatever if they can get a touch visit or whatever it's called it's wild uh God it really is crazy i wonder if they get drug tested in uh uh prison i don't know now i know in the army my husband was in the army for awhile well he's in it for seven years they had urine tests all the time um-hum oh really yeah and but they get people to do it for them yeah what do you mean they get people all right say just per se my husband's friend that you know knew that a pee test was coming up he would ask my husband to do it for him i mean not that my husband did it but oh yeah oh my God yeah are you serious and and it would actually work like they could get away with it well yeah because well because most of the time it was one of your contemporaries heading it up because my husband was like he was an E5 which is uh acting sergeant and he would uh um-hum um-hum no i'm not saying my husband did it but he's told me it's went on but his buddy would be coming through the line hey Ken i can't do this can you do it for me um-hum um-hum you know and like i said it's all of his contemporaries and his friend's there so he just you know he was in command or whatever so you know that happens that happens a i'm sure that happens a lot right oh gosh that is really scary it's really scary to think that uh some of these guys that were over yeah it's not a lot of them because not all of them have the nerve to do it so right that's true but it could just take one that that's in charge of a gun a cannon or a gun or something you know yeah well yeah now most of the time if they're fire well no they can do fire on practice ranges but there's usually lots of room for it too but if you get caught you get busted out of the army and they can send you to Leavenworth so right they can where you know not many people Leavenworth isn't it Leavenworth that the that is that a prison oh uh-huh yeah it's i think it's a government prison for um like treason and or um-hum um-hum i see wow the base my sister was on had a prison of their own which they they they're pretty strict in the Army i mean you get caught doing much of anything you get busted so a lot of people won't do it yeah well they need to be pretty  well we're just starting a family through adoption so i don't really have a lot of um concrete um opinions just what i know out of my peer group uh has gone through and none of it's been good oh really yeah uh the ones that can afford to have live in nannies they seem to be having an okay time huh uh-huh uh but a lot of the other ones that have are professional um i'd say fifty percent of you know my peers that i'm in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're you know going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade um-hum uh but i there must be some good service out there if you really look and pay for it right what what age child are you thinking in in terms of in terms of what they're talking about no for for yourselves oh infant um oh okay so you're starting from the baseline from the baseline infant yeah after eleven years of marriage yeah we are we're actually it's happening now so we're just going through the process i see so and and actually the question is uh very appropriate because i'm not sure whether um how strong the maternal instinct's going to be they tell me it's going to be strong do you have children right i have one son and did you put him in day care or is he older now or younger or well he's now he's now eighteen and in in you know has completed a couple of years of university sure so he's out of day care i right and and so that but i was working full-time uh when he was born but i was very lucky because i was a a college professor you uh-huh oh and so i was able to you know and i it was walking distance from my from my apartment so i went up there and i sort of left him with with a neighbor flex yeah um-hum and i left him in a carry cot when he was very little and i said you know he doesn't need anything except you know look look at him if he cries but you know don't pick him up and and this sort of stuff because i was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half yeah oh that's wonderful and i was able to you know get his his schedule just uh cooperated and right that's wonderful yeah and and i guess um that uh because of your um your uh profession i mean i um i'm in corporate communications but i've done freelance writing in the past yeah uh-huh so what we're hoping is that um i mean my husband thinks i can do it i've just never worked out of a domestic base you know i've always been in a corporate uh environment um-hum um but i'm hoping that possibly i can do something where i can go flextime or part-time or if they don't have that um my boss i'm very lucky though again too my boss is very akin to family building so i think that's something that something that couples need in going into this um-hum right um i don't know i do think there's good day care out there what part of the country are you in i'm in Maryland but but i was out of the country when um my my son was little but but the thing is if you have this flextime and that you might be able to do something similar to what i did which is you're in Maryland right that's what i'm hoping you know be there short times and then later on when he was you know i mean this we're talking about uh i went back to work and or taught some some classes like a week after he was born um-hum oh my goodness you were fortunate yeah and so yeah and so that's when i was saying you know don't don't pick him up and stuff but then later what i did was i brought a woman into the house yeah um-hum sure and she was she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff uh-huh and then i also came home and sort of was was able to see from a distance what she was doing and you know in a sense she she carried him around a lot too much uh you know for for my taste it was constantly no i don't want him to explore anything he might uh-huh uh-huh right uh he might hurt himself so do you think that i mean do you think that that was in a way though good objectivity good objectivity that now that's doesn't really that's not a correct English but um you know in a sense you see what i'm saying though from a mother's standpoint i mean in a way it it was quote unquote good objectivity objectivity i think it worked out very well a very well because what he learned to do by the time he was um-hum two or so he would sit next to the desk where i was grading papers or writing lesson plans and he had asked for a paper and you know sort of scribble and then he realized that there were quiet times and there were active times see um-hum yeah right and then he learned he he also learned that um there were times that you had to be gone so you probably minimized well we're actually um we're getting ready i mean you're far enough away now i can tell you this just locally i make sure we're going to Romania in a few weeks oh and that's um just did you say Romania or Armenia Romania Romania oh okay yeah yeah as in like what 20/20 and um but we we're real excited because we've just developed a contact oh good through professional people and it's private and it's hospital it's we're just very excited um oh great and well it it what's the word i'm looking for when you deal with issues like that um in terms of family building through adoption um and then you have people responding to you well if you go through that why would you put them in day care oh that's silly um issues are being raised prematurely in my mind but i guess they're not because it's something i'll have to deal with sooner than later um and i what i've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion i feel that if the child's healthy um you know as long as we make it feel secure i'd love to do something like with what you did um-hum um i don't think i could be a dumper where i could take it from you know eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there right right uh maybe after two or three or years old i don't know um oh i in my opinion it's even then i mean uh kids need you but yeah i just well they need a schedule i think i don't think the United States what country were you um in Europe when you were uh uh no i was in the Middle East um oh that's sort of well that's the same thing i mean i don't know how they are there but uh in eastern Europe my stepfather's from England it just seems the United States does not provide for either child care or geriatrics or elder care as i call it right right um and we're just not set up for that um with the i yeah go ahead no i was just going to say i guess uh my sensitivities are are much more with the you know to be at home because actually i had my grandmother with me fro m the time she was from the time she was ninety two until she died at ninety seven um-hum see i think that's wonderful and i mean that was recently after my son son was going off and i mean yes in a sense i went to work and she was at home alone some of the time but but still you know it was much better than being shipped uh-huh to a to a day care center right you know which is much my feelings on kids and the elderly i think we're too we're too too much towards it's somebody else's problem you know i want to work shove them in in some school for twelve hours a day we cast off right right that i'm that way yeah right it's easier and i agree with that that's why i you you know what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown but you can probably empathize with this yeah it's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts right right in terms of what to do um and i just don't think there is a day a good day care system um my company i'm particularly fortunate that they have they're in tune with that but i've been at companies where um you know the decision the the trend is or the definite mood is well we made conscious decisions not to have children and that's sad you know and in and a couple like us building through adoption there it's almost radical to some people right and what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out and um and i respect there are some women that i know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that they you know they may have the need for child care like that um-hum but i agree with you that it's just i call it dumping i mean i yeah no i i think that certainly there is a role uh for this type of help and and as long as one can can supervise it and and you know make it work um-hum into into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or or uh giving it you know the whole job to somebody else to take care of um-hum then yeah it's are it's in tandem then and yeah yeah i just um and there are trade-offs too i think one of the things that is a problem is that um in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers um-hum um it's just you know it's so low but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis it's prohibitive and some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year yeah um actually there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood is there seem there are several uh uh mothers mothers who stay home really um-hum and they take you know it's probably not completely legal uh i maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids sure but and they they take care of another child and i i can actually name could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this uh-huh and they yeah and i mean that's another possibility and you know you might want to stay home one year and some other lady might want to stay home for a a few years and i haven't thought about that yeah and actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old and she's an at home part-time paralegal so i'm thinking hm and we get along fantastically so i'm thinking you know and that's the way you have to um how was i'm just real curious how was the Middle East in terms of that with children yeah yeah is that is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them no well actually there was a day care center um where my son did go for a year i think from when he was two to three um-hum but then he actually started kindergarten at age three um-hum and so and it you know it wasn't like pre kindergarten it was real kindergarten oh really he must be smart yeah yeah so he was he was ready to to go to school at that point um-hum but yeah they're they do have such facilities but for the most part uh the with the extended family you know you can usually find somebody which is much like our neighbor you know to sharing responsibility and i'm and also there aren't that many women who who do who work uh-huh the professional yeah i was wondering about that um there i'm in Dallas and there was just a very big um series about Moslem women and yeah um-hum there were enlightening things that broke some of my stereotypical thoughts i'm digressing here but uh i was just real curious when you said Middle East if you didn't mind me asking yeah no no and i didn't mean Israel so you you assumed right oh no that's okay well even if you did that's okay actually i think well no because at first thought uh when i said uh you know i said that not many people work i'm i'm thinking oh well she's going to you know because certainly in Israel the women do work right right they fight they work  okay so do you enjoy camping i used to love camping but since we've got two little kids our camping styles have changed dramatically yeah well we've tried to go camping with them and the last time it wound up with my husband the only one that couldn't stand them left in the tent because the kids wouldn't calm down they wouldn't go to sleep they were crawling all over us they thought it was just party time all night long you know yeah we really haven't tried camping with with our daughter yet we we'd like to now she's getting a little bit older she'd enjoy it yeah yeah but uh i used to i was in Boy Scouts all through college and everything else so i was involved in a lot of camping you know when i was younger but oh boy so you're an old hand at it yeah even my desires for camping have changed uh used to be from roughing it and sleeping outside to now to to tents and motor homes and things like that yeah yeah i like cabins they're real nice also i've found that when we've gone camping we've had some bad experiences sometimes when you even have seem to have uh so you know tent sites that are a little bit off the beaten path but there's a cluster of them and we wound up with people like you know four feet away from us that are just bombed out of their minds or something all night long partying and that's not my idea of going out you know and being with nature so yeah plus nowadays you just have to worry about being where you don't can't get behind locked doors even because you know somebody come up and knock you in the head in the middle of the night or you heck you never know oh yeah it's frightening yeah yeah but uh you know if i if i can get way way up you know way up in the mountains or you know way out someplace i probably be a little bit uh you know less concerned but uh yeah we went to Yosemite and um we went we got a little cabin there and that was really nice but uh someplace like that where you like you say you can get way out in the middle of nowhere you know where you can really be away from civilization i i would feel safer there than i would some of these little uh tent site areas you know uh-huh yeah i wouldn't mind i know my brothers he's a big camper uh backpacker and everything and i i'd like to try that sometime with him where they they actually just take the sleeping bags and whatever food they they hike in someplace you know up to you know ten fifteen miles and then they they um-hum oh wow oh my goodness my body can't handle that anymore i want a queen size air bed you know to go in the tent or something they yeah yeah really and truly that's that's that's more desirable course with my wife and daughter you know any kind of outing is is would be good just to get away and do it uh yeah yeah i found a problem here too since we moved to Texas three years ago i was feeling like there's places with without fire ants or that aren't like all summer long it's so hot i you know i don't want to be out there when it's a hundred and ten degrees out trying to sleep well that's the thing there's really only a few months that you can really get out and really do anything and uh yeah and it's so wet in the early part of it and you know unless you know like i say unless you have a trailer or motor home and that and that's really what i would like to do someday i'd like to be able to afford a a trailer uh yeah yeah you know not a real big one but just something that that would have you know air-conditioning and a and an icebox and stuff like that so you can you can feel you can feel like you're outside but yet you know have a few conveniences contained yeah yeah yeah i can relate to that uh but uh you know we had some friends invite us to go to a place on a couple weeks that's uh four miles of dirt road and they have a trailer that they keep permanently there a little travel trailer and they said we could just camp out but with a two year old and a three year old three days without running water without the toilets i mean that's a little tough i can't imagine you know the diapers after three days forget it yeah that's that's a little extreme i yeah so you know i think we'll pass on that one but but now you know uh i know we'd like to maybe you know Disneyworld has those little campsites out there where you can you can rent a trailer or you know pull one or whatever and that might be kind of fun you know to spend you know spend a week doing all that stuff oh really that'd be nice yeah yeah yeah that would be fun but i don't think uh my wife or my daughter are quite ready for you know hiking into a campsite and sleeping under the stars and all that kind of stuff cooking over a campfire you know yeah i'm not sure i'm up to it either really yeah fishing and then going and you know eating what you caught and all that good stuff huh when i was younger i used to love doing that king of stuff it was a challenge you know because you were with a bunch of other guys and you know you it was almost a competition but yeah nowadays i don't care yeah give me the Ramada Inn yeah yeah yeah well i can understand that well we we'll have to get more supplies too i mean that's why it would be hard for me to imagine backpacking in because it seems like our car's just totally loaded down with everything we have to go camping it's like well of course you know you've got uh you got a whole different set of problems you still you know you need a stroller and yeah my well my husband said next time we go camping with the kids we're just going to strap them in their car seats at ten o'clock at night and then we'll go back to the tent they'll fall asleep and we'll be able to enjoy nature yeah uh-huh that's about right oh i remember just like when we traveled you you end up carrying everything uh everything that you own just about to you know take care of the baby uh yeah it seems like it we need a van or something to get i mean even with if we take the dog forget it there's no room for anything else yeah so yeah it's hard to do without the creature comforts sometimes but yeah i'm pretty rusty at it anyway i don't i don't know how i'd fare nowadays well last time we tried we bought a Coleman camp stove that was practically new at a garage sale for next to nothing and then we brought it home and tried one night to get it going and we could never get an even heat off of it so we need somebody you know with experience to go with us sometime or come over and show us how to get it you know going so well nowadays everything's so expensive i know like you know a good sleeping bag nowadays because like i you know all i've outgrown all that stuff and and it's been it's worn out anyway but to go out and buy a decent sleeping bag you know you're talking you know hundred dollars and yeah oh good grief and then then a you know a decent tent you're looking at a hundred fifty two hundred dollars and backpack all that kind of stuff i mean you could yeah you could stay really nicely at a spa somewhere for a week for what it would cost you to buy all that yeah exactly i mean by the time you get through outfitting yourself and then having to go sweat doing it uh you could you could go on a Club med uh everything inclusive vacati on really oh gee which i'd enjoy better anyway yeah well it but uh but i used to be a real good camper when i was younger i i mean i used to just we just you know carry canoes and and uh we used to hike all summer long we used to go up to New Mexico and and we would uh we would do nothing but hike and camp for three months oh that'd be fun oh gosh and uh you know wash your clothes wherever you are and you you really get used to the outdoors yeah yeah nowadays to for me to think even think about doing something like that i mean it's just kind of like no no not m e yeah it's amazing how when you get older you get smarter i guess i'd like to think that anyway people actually call that fun yeah i can't see that being really fun but yeah i guess i guess you know like i say if you know if you're going on a big hunting trip and you're going with two or three other guys that were good at it and that kind of stuff you know it might be okay for a few days yeah well they have these vacation packages i had a friend that went on where she went uh now what do they call it when you go down the rapids like in these rubber boats and stuff rafting or whatever yeah oh the white waters and she went oh gosh to Colorado or someplace and i mean they had like a a a gourmet chef that put you know the meal on for them wherever they tied up at night and i mean it was a whole different ball game wasn't like eating beef jerky or something yeah some of those things are pretty good yeah yeah some of those things would be okay yeah just expensive that would be a little probably a little drastic with kids but for you know two adults it it's rough enough yeah unless you just go and wear them out so badly that they'd collapse by the time they got off the raft they'd be wouldn't be any problem at all for the rest of the evening um oh boy boy i'd even i'd enjoy doing that myself yeah yeah that would be fun but everybody i everybody i've talked to that has done that they say after about three or four days of that uh-huh it takes them uh i mean they're sore for a week because you know you're all the tensing and the bouncing and everything else you use muscles you haven't used in years and oh really from all the bouncing yeah that's true and uh it you know that they end up staying home you know another three or four days when they get home just to recuperate from it oh gosh that's funny so i don't know but i you know like i said i used to enjoy camping but anymore you know just the whole atmosphere's changed you you don't you don't hear of many people that's taking their families and just going out go camping yeah yeah that's true you know now it's boating or or you know uh uh going on these uh uh white rapids or whatever the white water you know raft rides and stuff like that yeah yeah well i have you know hear like most of these people say things like going to you know Walt Disneyworld and stuff like that with their families it's more of a luxury kind of vacation than it is the the roughing it or whatever but yeah well they have that i had it's like a water country or something where they have this in the wilderness park it's close to it where you can take the kid and and kind of just let them go wild in that water country hum and uh you know and you and you kind of camp out and they got little little kitchens in the trailers and stuff but oh that sounds neat sounds like it sounds like it would be okay for a few days yeah yeah well maybe when ours get a little older and we really want to get elaborate we could do something like that but for right now they think it's a thrill to put put a pool in the backyard you know one of those little five foot KMart specials give them a glass of juice and boy they're ready for the afternoon you know yeah yeah yeah they are fun yeah little toots yep sometimes you know i i think it would be kind of neat maybe if she just wanted to get a little tent or something and you know once we get a fence in the backyard and uh and just let her camp out maybe until till yeah yeah just roast marshmallows and twelve or one o'clock in the morning till she gets scared and wants to come in you know how old is she she's six oh yeah but she yeah she she looks like she might be an outdoors person eventually but oh they both my wife and daughter take after each other they they get hot real easy and just being outside during the summertime they'll just pass out huh yeah and you know i i can go out and mow the grass and everything else and and stand it just fine and uh but my wife she's real hot natured She she would uh she just gets gets outside for five ten minutes and she's ready to come back in So i don't i don't think camping this time of year would i don't even think she'd think about it oh gosh yeah no no that doesn't sound too it would have to be November early December yeah when we were living in California people all the time went in the winter you know up in the mountains and stuff i don't know i can't see that either um south of San Francisco where in California oh yeah so that that was that's nice there because you do have some cool weather and some mountains in Sunnyvale yeah yeah oh yeah the weather's really nice and then you go you know you can go up in the mountains and it'll drop thirty degrees just on your drive up there so that's kind of i used to go to uh Fairfield um-hum um-hum and uh that's real pretty country up there yeah there's a lot of nice  okay what do you think are some current trends in uh the way families spend time together based on what you've seen um i i think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together yeah um i think uh like in my situation today on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together my husband's been off doing his thing all day today and i've been off doing my thing all day and i haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning really so uh are you newly married or um two years yeah yeah same same situation here i've been married about ten months so yeah i can i can i know what you mean it's it's really hard hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and uh you both have hobbies that are different you know if you have hobbies that are the same then you know you can enjoy your hobby together but my husband and i have different hobbies yeah is he a hunter and a fisher and all that no no he's a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector that's wild that's wild um so he was off today uh looking at at records uh-huh so uh and i was off you know doing you know house household type things you know laundry and um did some shopping and stuff yeah um um from the people i've talked to i don't know if i should bring this into it but um a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more um where they could manage their own schedule uh-huh and uh they could spend more time with their kids because they look back and you know they're all like um kind of regretful i think yeah i i think i think that would be the ideal situation i think that a lot of people like in my case i i do shift work uh-huh i don't i don't have that choice yeah same here um i have to be at work at at X hour you know at this at at a certain hour and i can't it's not flexible um it it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours and and maybe after we decide to have kids i i might find a job that has flexible hours i would i hope so anyway um but i would i don't know yeah that at TI is that where you work uh-huh it's really kind of sad some of the people that i work with they like when i worked on second shift um their parent their kids go to school during the day and then they wouldn't see them at night because they would be in you know at work and the kids are going to be in bed uh-huh and so it was kind of like they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses this relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends or something you know yeah so it was really sad just you know that a lot of families um have to well you know have to have dual income a lot of people choose to which is fine yeah but you know then the kids come to suffer yeah i ideally it would it would be nice to be able to just have like back in the old days you know back like when when i grew up uh-huh huh yeah you know the the mom stayed home you know and raised the kids my mom didn't go back to work until i was in junior high school yeah um so she was there pretty much all my you know formative years yeah and that was nice and i liked that and i would hope that i would be able to give that to my kids uh but i think with the way the future is um economy wise i don't think it's going to be realistic i know unfortunately that's probably true um do you think some the the parents spend quality time with their kids are do you think it's more like watching TV and stuff like that not really uh i yeah i i think that i think very few spend quality time i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff stuff like that i think that um yeah um uh most most kids that i see don't really they don't really value quality time yeah it's always that way until until until they're older and then they look back until it's too late yeah it's true um what's what are some other questions they have i'm not sure i know my parents are growing up i guess they never spent much time watching TV in fact i've never seen my mom turn on the TV we didn't really have one very often oh really yeah and and they spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff but you know my dad had his own business and it was easier for them to do that but i i don't know it was i guess i didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time yeah i i think kids now a days are raised on TV i mean that's that's almost like a surrogate TV is a surrogate parent yeah yeah that's a good way to put it and not a and not a very good one at that yeah pretty good way to put it if i had kids well if you had kids what kind of things do you hope to do um i i hope to of course be able to teach them right from wrong i hope i hope to be able to spend um their growing up years being in the home you know not having to work um and being able to do i i i know a lot of people who who um yeah um i work part-time also and i a lot of people that i work for are mothers that stay home uh-huh um and they they do a lot of volunteer work and they're real active in the community and um they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working uh-huh and i'd i'd like to be able to do that i'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids do volunteer work and be in clubs and stuff yeah i agree i hope that happens in my case yeah yeah but i think that's for the the few and far between i think that uh probably ninety percent of the of the um parents out there are are probably working parents yeah yeah huh and i i don't i don't really see that that trend changing much if anything i think there's going to be fewer and fewer uh single income families i know yeah and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids yeah that may not necessarily be consistent with yours exactly see i i never i don't even know what day care is really all about because i i never went to a day care center i never i never had that kind of experience yeah huh i well i don't even think we had i don't even remember them being around when we were little yeah i i see it seems like that's that's a big trend you know in the last ten years day cares have have have popped up and become a lot more um a lot bigger part of of the kids lives yeah it's like a home away from home for a lot of them sure is um well i guess we could ring this off since we we've exhausted all of our ideas we seem to agree yeah i i think yeah i think this is a good closing point yeah so well it was really nice talking to you yeah you too i wish you the best thanks you too um bye bye-bye okay thanks bye-bye  my name is Diane i'm Cliff Penn hi well what's your favorite team i like the Chicago Bears well i uh don't have uh much much of a favorite team since the Cowboys haven't done much so i guess i'll just have to say the Cowboys the Cowboys well they haven't done much for they never did much even when Landry and Staubach were playing i'm being real sarcastic did you like them back then um oh yeah in fact most of the world liked them back then whether you did or not touch yes well when i moved here in the uh mid seventies um are you in Dallas yes so am i uh i just use to laugh because back then i was a Steelers fan i'm from originally from Pittsburgh yes um-hum um-hum and that was not the thing to be in Dallas when they their preseason games at the stadium you know where the Cowboys versus what do you think they're going to do this year yeah oh they may be a little better but uh they got a long way to go uh-huh in after Landry got the shaft he sure did that i agree with you on yeah what do you think of uh the guy who's coaching them now from Miami i can't remember his name off the top of my head i can picture his gray hair but well they all start with J so yeah he's Johnson right yeah yeah that's right well he's he's learned a little bit but the first year he was here he was playing college football and it was pretty simple stuff uh-huh are you a football fan uh by nature or is this something you grew into yeah i i in Texas uh football's the game instead of baseball that's true i agree with you there though at least it has a little more action than baseball yep um-hum yep well i don't know why i like the Bears but i do i just think they have some good players but well they've had some very good players and fact uh the best tight end in football is now their coach um-hum eighty nine yeah Mister Ditka well you can't say too much bad about him i mean he did learn his hone his trade under Landry well actually he was uh as as a coach he learned his trade under Landry but as uh as a player i remember seeing him as a young man that's what i meant fighting everybody off while he caught a pass on a tight end yeah the University of Pittsburgh well i was probably a little bit too young for that but um i know we just laugh now in terms of not specific teams but um we have company and one of the men got bored earlier this afternoon and he turned on the television and one of the ladies said what's you know what's the football game and i wasn't even aware i mean i knew it but i just i guess i kind of shut it out like most females yeah something right yeah the the World Football League is playing uh Frank uh playing in Germany i think i've forgotten where they are Germany and somebody that oh funny San Antonio and San Antonio has a team or something yeah Landry is down there over San Antonio now yeah oh you're kidding oh goodness are you that avid a fan that you would watch it regular uh year round no no i uh actually i haven't uh watched it as much since uh the Cowboys' demise as i used to i used to watch it every weekend but irregardless of who was playing whether it was Cowboys or not uh-huh yes it it seemed like it's up to about ten to twelve years ago i mean all the sports including football it used to seem uh before the higher ticket prices in terms of just not for fans but i mean what what the salaries some of the players were getting yeah yeah now that it's uh well i think a lot went out of it when they had the strike too yeah i mean i um i mean like i was just reading something in today's paper about Herschel Walker and i had to chuckle you know i mean you wonder what he really is i mean i really don't care but what happens to a player when they're sitting in their cars and they fall asleep because um they're so tired and the carbon they're overcome by carbon monoxide fumes yeah yeah that's hard to believe all right you know um but i think it's still healthy i mean i have a nephew that plays football and if that's what he wanted to do i certainly wouldn't tell his parents to encourage it but i think it's still an honorable sport yeah who do you think uh Chicago will have quarterbacking now i have no idea who is he who um the guy the young guy from uh Ohio State i think he's already over the hill isn't he oh i can't remember hum it seems like it i can't even remember his my mind went blank today it must be the heat um i don't know i just uh i actually like you know i was probably was like you were when the when Payton was big you know this is probably about five years after when everything was the America team but um i actually once Payton left i kind of just lost you know yeah he was a superstar all right yeah i kind of just lost um and i don't think Ditka's going to stay around much longer i don't know if he renewed a two year or not i think he's either in the middle of that or just did that yeah it seems seems like the spice has gone out of it for him yeah it's kind of you know i mean uh it's it's kind of like when the Cowboys the Bears and the Steelers went you know like i said about ten twelve years ago it seemed like football was really interesting the and it didn't matter who was playing it just it was worth watching yeah there yeah there were several really good teams in that time frame yeah yeah and it was competitive and it seemed a little cleaner i don't know um yeah i think it probably was the uh now then there's a lot of dirty stuff going on on the line that the that the referees don't call things get out of hand yeah and there's some technical stuff you know this Minicam stuff these instant replay things that uh i'm not sure that i would agree with some of it but i still think it's a good sport yeah well actually i think if they'd a had that technical replay technical uh bit where they replayed it at Dallas would've won two Super Bowls that they didn't win because of bad calls hum yeah um-hum some of those calls well i have to agree with you because i can remember um when they played the Dolphins and i saw Ditka take the touchdown and i remember there were one or two calls in that game i think it was in seventy was that seventy three or seventy two i can't i can't even go back that far anymore yeah yeah yeah there was one that uh supposedly uh uh fumble after a touchdown and uh um-hum the Cowboys theoretically lost it but uh they didn't really in fact the guy uh who had recovered who was supposed to have recovered it later admitted that he had uh um-hum so now i know after it had already crossed the the goal line in the other guy's hand he jerked it out of his hand so it was he admitted that he had done that after the fact but you could see it on camera when it happened but the officials couldn't see it yeah usually usually when that happens and i mean it always seems to go the way of the ref's call though it never seems to go the way of you know either the coach or somebody protesting um yeah but that's really i guess what i know about football the where do you work where do you work pardon me right now i'm not i'm a homemaker yeah yeah true you're a homemaker well that's work enough my my wife says that is plenty work enough domestic engineering domestic engineering there you go yeah it's um pardon domestic engineering right right i don't know i just really had to laugh today i mean the what the subject was when i placed this call when the subject was football because uh we had just had that on that that was uh you know wear year round and i said oh they've got to be kidding i just don't think financially they'll make a go of it and then my husband said to me well it was somebody from the Vikings uh Mike Lynn or somebody who um was one of the promoters of that yeah right i said uh you know wouldn't they be defeating their purpose to go away from the NFL yeah i think they would but nobody seemed to uh you know nobody just thought that it so the motive was just another way to make a profit yeah the Vikings to me will always be Fran Tarkenton though yeah actually you know i mean that's just um that's the era i'm talking about i mean i remember when uh Gale Sayers played i i mean i can remember that's kind of when it seems like it was yeah yeah any team could beat any other team in that time frame and that's what made it so good yeah yeah right any probability could happen i mean now it's just it's and usually it's one team that's great over the entire season and then it's kind of flat watching some of it i mean it's um yeah and it's whoever has got the most money that gets the players and so forth right exactly i mean i can remember when drafts and Heisman i mean i could remember i mean i just i mean i used to think Dorsett was good now i look at him and i think well why did i ever think that well he was good in his younger days he really yeah he really was in his younger yeah and Walker now i mean i don't know if he's dried up or not the way they're talking that uh well he's he's getting old enough to be uh his legs wearing out but the last time i saw him play when he was healthy he looked mighty good did he and who's going to quarterback the Cowboys this year i don't even is it still the blonde headed guy Aikman it what do you think of him it'll be it'll be Aikman yeah oh Aikman himself if he had some talent around i think they'd be a super team but he can't do it by himself he's got to have a line in front of him that knows how to block uh-huh so you think it's the defensive element that's really lacking in the Cowboys yeah well no i think it's mainly the offense the defense is better than the offense really the the the uh offensive line is is uh-huh in terms of running yeah just hasn't been able to keep down the pass rush at all so that Aikman's had time to get rid of the ball and he's been and the main reason he's been hurt on occasion it's like most of them the offensive line didn't do it's job he got blindsided or something so protecting him yeah didn't he just go through through some rough elbow surgery or something about five months ago yeah yeah they found a whole bunch of chips in there that they though though they had one chip and they uh ooh uh-huh they uh got i've forgotten my son keeps up with this more than i in fact he should be on this network he's the one that knows all about sports yeah sure probably my husband should be too i just you know you just go through and you check those subjects and you go well there's not too much well listen i won't keep you on a nice Sunday afternoon right well i appreciate the call okay no problem and you have a good day okay bye-bye same to you bye-bye  there we are yes tell me what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up oh well uh when they were little we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks and things of that sort and um-hum boy i had two boys they were both interested in things like model rockets so we would go to the football field and set off model rockets i have two boys also um my children are um are swimmers and so as they were growing up much of uh our um normal life outside of school and everything around and revolved around their swimming so in order to have a reason for being there especially as they got older i became involved in it too so we were always together at their meets um-hum oh well that's good um mine were not terribly sporting uh they both did T-ball and soccer in grade school but neither one of them carried on uh the sports after that um-hum uh-huh yeah the the boys tried those but they really they did go in they started swimming when they were oh seven and eight and they really loved it and they're swimming both they'll be one is in college also swims in college and the other will continue to swim in college and they're fortunate they may even made nationals oh wonderful oh that's great and so we would drive up to see that when we whenever it was reasonably close but we did a lot of things um and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children um yeah i we live near Washington so we we would always go in for the museums sure that's always a big uh thing and one of my children is uh also a musician so um one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go either my husband or i or both of us would to concerts with him um-hum and my other child um uh is in big into tropical fish so our whole family we take family trips to different places to visit fish stores or go to fish shows so ah my goodness uh well we didn't have any uh avid uh activities like that they they were interested in a lot of things but nothing to quite that depth i guess but i don't think we've we've missed a fish store on the entire east northeast coast of the United States we would oh my goodness well we did go to things like aquariums and uh uh um-hum natural history museums and zoos and all of those things that one does with kids uh yes in fact it's funny our vacations have always been um uh uh uh as as they've gotten older when they were younger we would go to the beach but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things and that there would be a a feature each day um-hum ah yes whether it would be going to one summer we uh we went up to New England and we went to the marble quarries up there and uh uh to see that and another day we fish hatchery and so we did oh really yes you know we did try and of course we learned too but um and uh i don't know i uh when they were very young i did not work yeah yeah well i started working half time when uh they were at the nursery school um-hum and i i started working part-time when they were in um junior high school and high school and now and i worked in the school system and now i work a full school day but that leaves me off on holidays and summers but i was still home yes um-hum so it was a it was a you know i think they need me more when they were older than they do when they're yeah well i think it uh they need you in different ways that's true yes you want to be around for the crisis and things like that and that's right but it's not quite so much the hand holding and peanut butter and jelly making um yeah that's that's for sure that's for sure what do you do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see well it look well the one trend i would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers there are fewer of them home in the afternoons and i don't think it needs to be the mothers but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours um-hum yeah when they you know it was funny i can remember and my mother and i have talked about it how important it was when i came home from school um-hum it wasn't really conversation but there were always things that just tumbled out yes and uh a granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it but it when they when it's not there they miss it i think that's true but i don't i also think that's at least in my experience truer of girls than boys even when i was there my boys didn't share all that much with me and certainly not to the extent i did with my mother um-hum yeah yeah no i i i realize that but it's funny they don't always do it but occasionally they do and you want and when they do there's a reason for it that they're sharing it and you want to be available at least i've wanted to be available when they for some reason they had they were bouncing something off of me yeah um-hum right because it was something that was bothering them or they were concerned about and it was uh you just felt gee if i weren't here um-hum who would they ask or what would they do how or or if my husband that's right yes that's exactly right uh but it has been um it's been interesting and particularly i i think because the society in which we live families are separated you don't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles um-hum um i mean i grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives yeah well i did too we were close to my uh maternal grandparents i mean just a few miles and uh close enough to visit my paternal grandparents know quite often they were fifty miles away but um-hum yeah yeah see and we're uh that we i i grew up with you know every weekend there was some visiting somewhere um and it was sort of an Italian family um but my children we although we have some relatives in the area that we um-hum um we see we they don't have it's not that constant right thing where you are on intimate terms with cousins well when my kids were quite small uh we lived close to both sets of grandparents and they saw them a lot but they don't have any cousins uh or they didn't their uh their cousins are about ten years younger um-hum yeah uh-huh so uh they never played together or anything and there are only two of them and they didn't live in the same town yeah and i i just sort of think yeah that the trend of of families and time where where parents are spending less time you don't have the families too to take up the gap that's right and so the kids in some ways are are are suffering a little bit in that uh the model the role models that get the the the family issues that get discussed and all these i think are very important parts of them growing up so we yeah um-hum we try to to do it as well as we can we keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone and cousins and aunts and uncles and we do but it's although it's not the same we are um-hum and that's part of i think teachin g too is what a family is like because then how how do they pattern their own well everyone makes it's own model but uh it it seems that there should be some continuity and it's helpful to have uh things that yeah um become family traditions and that sort of thing that's yeah well we've always we have had this tradition um that we always go out before Christmas and cut our own tree um-hum and that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had now this year it's been was hard with our son now being in college so this was one thing that we um weren't able to do this year but we did that for ever yeah from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until uh our older son went away to college oh well that's the kind of thing that they will remember though and we have advent calendars still from the time that they came you know to uh-huh ours finally disintegrated we had a felt one that was like it was a Christmas tree that had uh a little trinket for each day oh oh yes that was pinned on the date and then you took it off and put it on the tree so at the end you had a decorated tree that's uh-huh well ours ours is uh a friend and it finally got moth eaten we threw it way last year uh a friend of mine from Denmark hand appliqued one for each child how nice and i mean they look today as new as they did when they gave them to she gave them to us and there's a ring and you buy a present oh i see and you wrap the present up and i mean the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of Band-Aid and an eraser and things how cute to today where um sometimes i put a little gift if i see something that's uh occasionally a Christmas tree decoration which they will save for their uh-huh their future to sometimes just money um pieces of candy so i think as they're getting in college i i just my for my older boy that was in college i put a dollar bill for each day yeah oh i'm sure he appreciated that which was the equivalent um well it was the equivalent of a Christmas present um-hum but it was uh and it was and you know it was fun but that's a tradition and they will those will be passed on to them when they when they get married and leave yeah well you were saying what other trends are there and one just occurred to me because i was editing a book about it recently um-hum and that is the trend in a lot of uh lower class areas for the grandmothers to be raising the children yes yes and that's a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs the broken yes and the broken families we um as i said living in an area of Washington DC and um-hum we definitely see this uh and um it's that grandmother figure not only raising her own children but raising um children from the streets too frequently right well we had a sociologist at the center where i work who was writing a book on uh multigeneration um-hum um matriarchies in a way uh where the tradition in the family has been for a teenaged daughter to have a baby while she's still living at home with the mother um-hum yes well this is a this is a sign uh this is in fact uh we've been studying this in our school that um this is one of the symptoms or not the symptoms it's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing it's a rite of passage and yeah and it they uh the the fact that they're unmarried has nothing to do with  okay what kind of home do you have well we we bought more than we can afford uh-huh and uh so we're in a fairly uh exclusive neighborhood and got a big house uh-huh five thousand square feet with wow a bunch of kids running around uh-huh and horrible real estate taxes and and everything else oh really so it's about all we can afford yeah i know what well mine's i guess i live in a upper middle class type home uh neighborhood uh most of them are all professionals in the neighborhood uh i live by myself what i uh i have more than i need i have a two story home which i don't need but uh uh-huh i got it as a steal and property taxes i mean property in Texas you know i bought uh came i used to live in Texas and i moved to Florida for four years and i moved back and when i moved back was in a slump and so i really stole this house for you know for peanuts it was a one of those corporate buy outs a couple had had moved in it lived here three months and and got transferred to uh Atlanta so their corporation was trying to sell it you know they just want to get rid of it so they took and offer i gave them which was very low uh-huh i know the neighbors probably hated me because it kind of ruined the resale you know i think what though the average i think when you go to sale but we don't have too many homes for sale in this area because it's it is growing and building fast well that's interesting because i i've i heard around Dallas that uh real estate was up for grabs yeah it's it's improving now where i live i live out by DFW airport and uh it's really growing like mad i mean they're just building and they're uh-huh i'm talking two and three hundred thousand dollar homes uh and they're just building them yeah faster than people can move in them and that you know i understand that the slump in the market didn't affect didn't affect that price range chunk because those people are going to buy you know whether it's you know rich people like that are going to buy you know there it's the the middle income people i think and the lower middle income they're that are hurting you know that uh-huh sixty and seventy thousand dollar homes that are hard to get rid of yeah but and then i've heard pros it has it's picking up though now it has well we've sort of got the other end of the spectrum going here the uh we had Mobil Oil Corporation move their corporate headquarters here about five years ago uh-huh and i bought this house uh just before they moved down uh-huh and when they moved in here the price on houses just about doubled all over the area did it really huh and uh that tells you something so we we got ours at a a fairly good price uh-huh but it stimulated a lot of the builders to start building fancy homes um-hum and so we've got a lot of houses within a a few miles of us that are one million million and a half yeah i i know i do too and uh it helps though it helps the value your property yeah it helps the value of our property except we it helps makes your taxes go up too though except we had a neighbor here just about gave his house away uh-huh uh he sold it for only slightly more than he paid for it uh four five years really and uh so he's kind of knocked down the neighborhood for a little while until that that average goes out but an awful lot of these fancy homes are not selling yeah yeah right yeah oh really because they built them and put all this money into them and nobody's interested in buying oh okay well boy they're sure buying them here grabbing them up it they're gorgeous homes but i've never seen so many two story homes and they're really building a lot of two stories all of the really fancy ones are all two story you just don't find any sprawled out one story homes anymore for some reason they're just and boy the area i live in is really really growing fast in fact they're just fixing to right behind me was a a house sat behind my property it was on fourteen acres it was just a kind of a nice little brick home had some horses and you know and a developer bought them out about six months ago and so they were going to build some really nice nice homes back there which will you know really help my house but like i said except for my taxes are going to go up because of these nice homes you know i they're going to jack the prices up you know so i mean taxes that so we end up probably having to pay more taxes but uh-huh well they're doing some some strange things here i think that the price of real estate's gotten so high and they're trying to get the value out of the homes so they subdivide around here they'll put a million dollar home on a half acre lot oh do they and you know you put a five thousand square foot house on on a half acre lot or one acre you know half acre lot and you can clip the lawn with a pair of scissors uh-huh yeah you are right man we have some in Dallas has some of those zero lot line homes are you know five hundred thousand dollar homes sitting on a zero lot line and you can you know wave at your neighbor you know and hear their stereo well they build them really where you can't hear them they put the living areas opposite one another so i guess it's all right i don't know i i have a lot i have an enormous backyard a really much much more than i can take care of which i don't i have it done because i can't afford i i tried taking care of it myself the first year i moved here and i said i'll go without groceries but i'm going to have my yard done i just i can't do it you know it just wasn't worth it so i have it done and i it's a best money i've ever spent is having it done yeah and it's just so regular and i just just don't have to worry about it well sometimes it uh keeping after the yard gets me we enjoy sailing quite a bit uh-huh and sometimes we go off on a one week cruise uh-huh and i come back it's rained quite a bit while we're gone i can hardly find the house oh yeah i know i know when i lived in Florida my mother visited me she says you know you can almost watch your grass grow down here can't you and i said yes you can i mean it just grew and i could have mowed it twice a week down there if i had the inclination which i didn't but uh that's when i started and when i lived in Florida i had my yard done down there too it was the humidity was so bad that i just i couldn't get out there and do it as much as i wanted to uh-huh i like yard work no i don't if i did i'd do it uh if i had to i would do it i'll put it that way i don't have to so i don't do it but if i had uh i bought myself i bought the the best of equipment i said if i'm going to do it i'm going to get myself a good lawn mower and get all the bells and whistles and and i did and now it sits out in the garage and hasn't been running in over two years um but i'm but everybody in the neighborhood keeps a very nice yard thank goodness and that yeah that's one of the things i have to face up to there's uh quite a few retired people in our neighborhood oh okay and it seems like all they have to do is is go out there and put down lime and spread fertilizer and pull up dandelions and uh-huh i know it take care of their lawn as beautiful beautiful lawn and i come over and look at my lawn and this nicely cut crabgrass and uh dandelions and plantains and everything else under the sun coming up i know it um the uh oh i know but you know usually there in this uh new i've got one on this there's usually one neighbor in the in on a block that doesn't doesn't take care of their yard as or doesn't do anything to the yard and i keep thinking why do the people buy homes if they're not going to keep their yard why don't you stay in an apartment if you're not going to touch your yard you're not going to you know you just ruin it for everybody else i think i know where my daughter lives there's a woman that lives behind them that the yard has never been watered and she lives in a real nice neighborhood and it it's i saw it for the first time this morning what a eyesore eyesore that was i said i'd run her out that's a shame that somebody let their yard she has poison ivy growing over her garage can you believe poison ivy and she's got children um and it's just oh what an eyesore terrible but no i i really do like my neighborhood it's close enough to DFW i can be at the airport in ten minutes but i can't hear the planes flying i can see them uh from upstairs i can almost watch them land on the runway but i can't hear them for some reason yeah and uh uh i like living real close to an airport because when i get home from a trip i want to get home i don't want to drive forty five minutes you know after i get home i want to be home so i i always choose to live by an airport in Orlando i did the same thing i lived right by the airport so i could get right home yeah and the the noise isn't real i say i can't hear this and when i lived in Orlando i couldn't hear the airplanes either i guess if i lived right on the flight pattern it would be different but uh i don't i like i like to watch airplanes a fact i can lay in my bed at night and watch the planes coming in DFW and i'm i i know if they're two seconds apart or just watch the lights come over they must come all in from the same pattern uh-huh and i can just lay there and just just watch one come past the the roof line of the people across the street from me and uh just like seem like every two seconds i'll see them come in from about you know nine o'clock to ten fifteen they're just streaming in is that your version of counting sheep yeah i guess so must be they i hadn't thought of that but i guess it is and sometimes i have uh come downstairs at night and used my telephone downstairs if it rings and uh and i look out my kitchen window and there must be thirty airplanes circling above not over my house but over DFW uh-huh it's the weirdest looking sign i thought my i guess they're i don't know why they're all circling i guess they're but it's weird looking so many lights up in the sky yeah but i i guess it's interesting uh i like to look at airplanes well we're kind of fortunate we're right about halfway between National Airport and Dallas oh are you and so they've uh sort of established sort of a no man's land here uh-huh and so we don't get any traffic from Dulles over the house and we don't get any traffic from uh National oh okay and but you can sit in the backyard and you can watch the planes uh lining up for the approach yeah that's nice i have a girlfriend lives in Alexandria west is it Virginia Alexandria she works for the government she's a yeah that's that's not well it's about forty five minute drive from here yeah oh is it  well did you get a chance to watch any of the games uh no i i just kind of i i kind of watch them on the news and that's about it oh okay uh uh um the Michael Jordan's on Chicago Bulls isn't he yeah what did he get hurt last night or no i don't think so because uh i saw just a little bit of the game today and he was out there playing oh okay although uh i what i saw was at the end of the first quarter i think he only had like eightch eight points um-hum at the end of the first quarter they thought that was big news oh yeah so i don't know but i don't know who won and uh i don't know who do you normally pull for the the Mavericks or no i i kind of feel like the about the Mavericks the way i do about the Cowboys now oh yeah yeah uh just all this Roy Tarpley stuff and and uh what is it their you know he got he's in trouble again down in Houston and and uh they said the other night his contract is so big that if anything happens to him you know if they don't trade him they'll have to pay him off you know so they're rather have him except that he gets in trouble all the time and falls off the wagon and and and have some chance of him playing you know earning his money oh jeez yeah because that's just dollars right out of the franchise yeah sure is oh man yeah now i uh i i've always been pulling for the Lakers for a long time oh yeah and uh not just not just because they always win but uh when they had uh Akeem they're consistent um-hum anybody who was old as that playing that well you know i just kind of had to go with them then i kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and uh course uh all the people that follow the Lakers and everything out there in in California um and it also helps when they were winning yeah well they play better as a team than anybody else seems like i was i always wondered that you know i i will take a look at the individual score you know in the individual stance in the NBA um-hum and you know they they have in the paper you know like fifteen different categories and they'll have like a individuals uh they'll have the the highest scorer the top rebounders uh assists foul shooting percentages and all that and you go thown through and virtually every one of the categories there isn't uh a Laker in the top ten usually hardly any uh anybody anybody in the top twenty except for like Magic uh-huh and uh yet the Lakers continue to win so you're right i think they do really play much better as a team than they do uh uh each one you know individually at their spot but uh yeah and year in and year out it's not like they have you know a lot of teams will will will win the play-offs and then the next year they'll be all they'll be too busy doing their endorsements and stuff to yeah to concentrate on the game i understand that um i guess Boston's really uh giving uh aren't aren't they playing Detroit i think Boston's playing Detroit and i think they're really giving them a run for their money yeah except Larry Bird's hurt did he get hurt again his his back is bad all the time now i think yeah yeah i tell you what i guess it's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy yeah they play two or three times a week like you know and then they go on road trips and they do the same thing and and then they and then they stay out for two or three weeks at a time so it really gets you know the i mean they're sleeping in different bed every night and yeah yeah and i imagine that really helps his back he ought to have his own bed come along with him you know uh-huh yeah he said he said the other night on the news that he hadn't done any extra shooting for six weeks so you know and he's the one that's always winning the um the the outside the three point shot and the oh yeah yeah he does that every year yeah matter of fact i watched him uh on TV you know sink i don't know a jeez it was like uh uh thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range uh-huh unbelievable yeah oh i don't know did you ever play much basketball not much just uh just just playing horse and stuff like that yeah yeah because it's it kind of a violent game it really is for a non contact sport quote unquote and and they don't yeah and they don't wear any pads so i yeah really i figured some of those guys got pretty funny funny looking uh eye wear yeah they have to wear goggles because they get hit in the in the face with elbows all the time man well it's his it's i was looking in the paper for something on it and here's the the top NBA draft prospects and uh i mean they're all the size of football players you know except they're just taller yeah several years ago when i was up in uh Cleveland i was staying at the Marriott and the Cavaliers were playing somebody i think it was like Utah or somebody like that and uh i was down by the pool and there was all these guys standing around about chest deep in water now i wear uh contacts and i i had my glasses on and i went down there and and just jumped into the water where they were and it went right up over my head and i came up spittering and sputtering for air and they were all the basketball players there to play the Cavaliers they were all like uh like six eight and uh-huh uh you know six ten and they were standing in water that was like six foot six foot yeah you know and it was uh it was funny i tell you i saw i saw a guy i don't remember what his name was but he got on the elevator and he had his swimsuit on and uh he was just skin and bones you know it looked like something out of Africa um-hum and uh i made some comment and uh he says yeah he says i weigh about uh uh two hundred and forty pounds yeah but he says it's not much when you stretch it over seven foot one yeah really so you're right those guys really you know the the big ones i don't even know how much Ewing weighs but uh he's got to be way up there oh yeah well here's a here's a guy from LSU Stanley Roberts he's seven feet tall and he weighs two hundred and eighty pounds so God that's a that's a lot that's a lot of a lot of guy coming down on you yeah um-hum jeez i didn't even see who's who's supposed to have the the uh the best uh draft picks it doesn't even say it doesn't say here it says uh it says the underclassmen this is for underclassmen for June twenty six yeah and uh i guess i guess they don't they have they they uh have a lottery on it they pick numbers and that's how they take them in order oh yeah it must not be according to their how they did during the year i i used to go down to Reunion Arena uh went down there a couple years on the day of the draft um-hum and that was really pretty interesting they usually have uh uh you know a video uh highlights of the season you know and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the Mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage both the good and the bad um-hum i i don't know i haven't i didn't go down there last year but uh it it was only like a couple dollars to get in and it was really kind of interesting but uh so who do you thinks going to win the play-offs i i don't know who's is it Chicago and and Chicago uh and let's see uh Golden State and the Lakers and Chicago and Philadelphia think Chicago's playing Philadelphia and then the uh shoot i can't remember them all now Utah Portland Boston and Detroit right yeah yeah okay that's the NBA yeah NBA play-offs Philadelphia was uh favored by one point over Chicago and the Lakers one point over Golden State and Detroit by five five over uh Boston jeez i think Boston Boston will win think so yeah i tell you what those guys really hang tough um-hum you know i i'd like to see them back up there again they really uh they really gave some some really good years of uh uh of enjoyment and fun and everything have you ever been up there to Boston Garden oh no uh well i don't know is that in i i haven't really gone to a lot of games live but boy i'd sure like to basketball's gotten to be a lot of fun um-hum  okay obviously the team that i support would be the Cowboys um uh-huh i say that i support them there's been just so much that's happened to that team since they got rid of Tom Landry that was just like you know blasphemy around here well and uh we felt the same way he was an institution and how how could they do that so yeah oh yeah i know i know i don't think i'll ever forget when one of my friends called me and said you're not going to believe this because i had not heard it you know and they said they have fired Tom Landry it's like you know what slander how could they do such a thing so uh ever you know since that i used to be such a an avid fan you know it was ridiculous but now quite honestly i i think that i support the Oilers as much as anybody um you know just because it is a Texas team but i cannot stand Jimmy Johnson or Jerry Jones can't stand Jimmy Johnson or Jerry well uh you know i was just trying i was just trying to think of uh who who our coaches of Houston Oilers you probably know uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah i really i don't even i don't know now uh it'll probably come to me but i was thinking of yeah i just i think of Bum Bright you know but that's been many many many years ago the yeah well Bum Bum Phillips yeah Bum Phillips i'm sorry yeah yeah well he's the one that we couldn't believe that they they let go and then we had Jerry Glanville who is guess is now in Atlanta and now we get the guy who was the University of Houston yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh head coach for many years it'll come to me in a minute yeah i can't i can't think so we did pretty well uh yeah how did you feel about having about Jerry Glanville oh you know people either hate him or they they like him quite a bit well i didn't really hate him or anything but i think the image of the team as a whole just had a real dark image and he he wanted to make these you know the uh yeah yeah uh kind of like the Oakland Raiders used to be the real bad team and they were they were mean and we had so many penalties and it gets really you just really get ticked off right uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah when your team keeps getting these stupid penalties and they don't seem to you know i mean that's just terrible and yeah yeah it's it's you know it aggravates me no end when you're talking about a really close game and then they do something stupid like start a fight or you know they have they have something like that called and then that is aggravating yeah uh-huh or do something where where you know it puts the other team in a better advantage and you know just for some stupid things that we probably could have done better so right yeah yeah i feel like the image of the on the Oilers has really been cleaned up and like last year Warren Moon and and so many of the guys are doing some good things off the field yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah so it seems like though uh it seems like all my teams always you know that i that are local to me wherever i live from when my husband was in college uh-huh you know you just never on a given day they could do anything and then on another day but they the consistency just when it really gets down to the championship or or the really mean meaningful uh game right uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah it seems like they blow it they don't come through course now Dallas did great for many years oh yeah you know it was just like you were so spoiled it was such a novelty if they lost a game you know and they could lose one game out of you know the whole season and people would just be completely up in arms uh-huh and i really you know as far as future of the Cowboys i really hate to say it but i think they're going to end up being a contender within the next couple of years i really feel like that will think so well they've been down for a while so it kind of runs in cycles i think yeah yeah yeah and so you have the teams that stay up on top for several years and then they start yeah right i think and it's a sad thing to say but i think it really depends on how much money it you know money it always comes back to money everything does but if uh Jerry Jones continues to pay these guys what you know they say they're paying them i don't know you know i think it depends on you end up you know the best players will come there if they're going to be paid the most so uh you know i don't know it's interesting we'll just have to see but it's just very very difficult for me to to support them it's you know a lot of the guys i really like you know and and uh i loved Herschel Walker that just blew me away when they traded him you talking you were talking about somebody that was really involved in the community and did a lot of things for for kids and stuff like that he was extremely involved in that in that aspect uh-huh and i think that's why i i liked him so well but uh i don't know you know when i i watch it and then i start sort of seeing myself enjoying it i'm like you're just you're just doing this for the players you know don't think about Jerry Jones or Jimmy Johnson either one but you know it'd just be so aggravating when they did win and then uh Jerry Jones would come out of the uh you know the press box i mean i would just go uh you know wild it's like it ruined the whole game for me because i had to look at him you know is he the owner yeah he's the owner uh-huh and he and uh Jimmy Johnson went to uh college together they played football together in college um and so they're like this is just like the buddy system you know and they're of course they're not from Texas so that riled everybody up you know this is like Arkansas people yeah so uh that didn't go over well so we'll see as i said i really think that they'll eventually they'll eventually be a contender so well this should be uh we did pretty well last year so i'm thinking this ought to this ought to be a good year for us well have have you been involved at all in this new World Football League i haven't watched the first thing yeah yeah it's no i haven't uh you know i find myself it's just it seems like it's so hard to uh i don't know why it is but it's just so hard for me to get involved in it you know i love football well it well yeah but you know i feel like i'm not watching the NFL for some reason it's like oh it really doesn't count you know and that's terrible but that's just sort of the way i feel about it doesn't count but well i tend to tend to uh well when my son was still at home uh uh-huh course he watched everything sports and i was involved but i tend not to watch things so much now unless right uh if it's my home team uh-huh or you know basically that's it or it's or it's some championship type games or something yeah yeah yeah i mean you you see you can definitely get involved in it more when it's somebody that you've supported all along and it's someone local because you've got all the press you know you read more about them of course and and hear more about them on on television a nd and such but uh i you know as much as i love it i would think that i would sit down and watch it but it just as i said for some reason it's like oh they you know they're just out there playing around they don't uh they don't really they don't really count who is the quarterback i don't even know who that your quarterback is uh for Dallas uh my mind went blank i can picture his face uh-huh oh my word has he been there couple three years yeah he's uh he's been here for several years oh pooh oh well it'll come to me as soon as we hang up i can't i cannot think of his name he's been injured they've done he's had several surgeries he's a young like a young kid i mean you know he's uh-huh i don't know if he's even twenty five yet i don't think but uh he uh he's had as i said several surgeries on his hand and and uh he's making a fortune of course he didn't play that much uh last season he was out for maybe you know four or five games so well Warren Moon broke his i think his was it his little finger or his thumb i forget toward the last couple of games of the season so he was out for the you know the last part so you know yeah uh-huh yeah yeah course he's not real young either he's that's true he is he's considered an old timer i suppose in his he's probably in his early thirties i would think at least uh yeah yeah you know if we don't do something with him at the helm you know then it may be downhill then for us for a while yeah yeah yeah yeah you know it takes a it takes a strong leader in that position because we had the guy the i forget the guy's name the one who came in for him uh-huh and played in one game you know we made some play-offs or something toward the end it seems like and this guy came in and we won i mean the guy played beautifully and then then the next week which was a really important game uh-huh yeah uh-huh it didn't he it just fell apart didn't work but it but you talk about exciting when something you know we were just yeah yeah oh yeah just so thrilled it's true right right when the seem like right before the Christmas holidays or somewhere seem like my mom was there from uh they're from Alabama and my mom has never watched yeah uh-huh football hardly in her life and she sat there with me and i was explaining some of it to her and she was getting really excited and that was so neat yeah uh-huh uh-huh really getting into it uh-huh yeah yeah it's it's it's addictive i mean i come from a my i have several coaches in my family and oh you know my mom is just a freak about it you know she she's just as bad as anybody and my fiancee if it's involved with ball he will watch it you know right oh so i was i was raised with all that stuff so you know it's just like all of our holidays center on what time is the game start you know we have to hurry up and get all this food out of the way because yeah yeah that's kind of kind of the way way we've been too but it's it is fun i really enjoy it yeah oh yeah yeah you know i would like to i i say i have i didn't want the Cowboys to win but sure i'd like to seem them you know end up end up doing better it's just you know you you really miss it when you aren't so intense you know as as we were when they were such a great team you know yeah you kind of i don't know you know when they're not doing well or they consistently do poorly just kind of kind of lose interest if you don't which is a shame but that's uh way people are yeah yeah you know it's like why uh-huh uh-huh it's like why am i even watching this you know i it was seems like it was the height of the of the uh Cowboys empire so to speak when uh uh Earl Campbell was playing for the Oilers uh-huh and i'm a UT freak too i mean i'm a University of Texas fan so i followed Earl Campbell over to the Oilers and and uh you know i kept up with that as well and and i was i was just crazy about him so i uh-huh  okay Carla can you tell me uh uh what type of movies do you like um well i like uh i guess i like all kinds of movies but the ones i don't like are kind of like Monty Python that type of thing but i like all kinds of movies i like to see movies when they come out and uh i generally prefer watching movies that have the stars that i like like Arnold Schwarzenegger and that type thing oh like the Terminator or yeah i mean those are kind of rough for me sometimes but i still like him as an actor so i like watching those movies i liked uh when he played in Twins did did you see that uh-huh yeah i saw it which was out of character for him you know playing such a a softy um i tend to uh i like the lighter movies myself yeah yeah rather than the uh the uh tear jerkers i think uh at least for me uh life is full of that stuff you know and it needs some light moments yeah uh-huh i don't really like the tear jerker type either surprisingly surprisingly even though you know just seems like i don't know they try to make things sad sometimes that really aren't i don't know why did you see the movie Dad that was a movie that really really was good and really got me um no uh who who was in that uh had it was the guy from Cheers Ted Danson i think was in it that was so good oh yeah yeah yes yes okay i like him in fact he was up he's he's big into uh uh ecology and he was up to save the Bay you know for uh Narragansett Bay yeah um-hum um so he came i i actually i live in Rhode Island you know i work in Massachusetts because it's not that far away but i live in Rhode Island so but no i didn't see that one i didn't um uh-huh we're kind of uh uh we look at the movies and we say yeah we're going to go and see them go and we probably don't usually end up until until they come out on in tape uh-huh yeah and then we'll go down to the video store and rent them and and look at them um i like uh uh some science fiction movies i liked uh Alien i thought that was good oh really and uh uh Two Thousand and One uh-huh i don't know if you've did you see i haven't seen many of those but i do like them i mean no you didn't see Two Thousand and One oh that was that was excellent that was if you if you get a chance you can you can rent it yeah uh-huh uh i like a lot of Gene Wilder i like him too uh-huh i like uh all the stuff that he's done and Mel Brooks yeah uh what was the latest movie you've seen the latest movie was uh Back to the Future part two or three whatever yeah i've seen all those those are pretty good yeah i like him i like i liked the first one best i think they're usually yes the the first movie out is usually the best one and then they try and do other sequels some of the sequels yeah some work but most of them don't i think they're trying too hard on the pushing but that seemed to that seemed to be pretty good i don't i don't i liked that um i haven't seen any of the real uh new releases i'm trying to think of uh uh what's out there now actually not there isn't much of anything really uh uh-huh i've seen like all the movies that come to the dollar theatre there's a dollar theatre in town we don't really pay um five bucks to go to see a movie because they have pretty good movies you know not too long after they've been out at the dollar theatre so we go there we used to go there quite a bit we haven't been there lately very much but i think the last movie i saw was Awakenings have you heard about that um it was more like a it was a true story it was based on a true story it's about a it's about a disease that that caused people to go into like total what do you call it i mean like a like a coma or amnesia or kind kind of like a coma yeah and then they came out of it i won't tell you the rest oh is that um um it was like a life after death experience something similar to that was was no that was Ghost wasn't it wasn't that Ghost i didn't see Ghost but i've heard no i didn't see Ghost either um but i know what you mean i've i saw uh it was based on a true story i saw the what this was based on a true story yeah yeah are are you thinking of uh Flatliners yes that's the one right okay okay yeah yeah and they didn't want to come back that was uh life yeah that was good that was real good right or or they came back but they weren't really back well they uh they almost didn't make it back in a couple cases but uh they came back and their lives were different after that and all this it was it was pretty it was pretty neat yes so you're in you like the you like all the Steven King i have to go see it yeah um i don't like real scary movies though at all yeah no i'm not um well Alien was Alien was Alien was yeah was it see i'm not i'm not really into scary i mean i it was it kept you on the end of your seat uh-huh um i don't like any of the Chainsaw Massacres and all that kind of stuff you know the the gory ones i don't care for them at all uh i just avoid all that uh um-hum yeah and the like Friday the Thirteenth and them yeah i've never even seen any of those part one or zero or ten yeah i don't like that but that getting back to that theatre you got you guys got a theatre down there that it only costs you a dollar and you can get in to see is that right yeah and they have seven movies playing at once so it's pretty good selection and they're always you know top top rated movies i mean i've seen you know quite a bit of i just saw Kindergarten Cop there i guess that was the last movie i seen it was good i liked that the what was it Kindergarten Cop oh that's with uh that was with Schwarzenegger too yeah yeah Arnold yeah that was a softy movie yeah for him that's right yeah that's right that's right um there was just one out there was just one out well it it wasn't out it was uh uh the Exterminator was it the Exterminator Terminator oh the Terminator where he came back from the future oh um what was that Flashback or something like that Total Recall hum nope nope um yes yes maybe it was Total Recall yeah that was tough yeah yeah it's good movie uh huh well i'm going to have to get going hum i'm going to have to get going but have have we talked five minutes oh okay yeah around around there yeah actually it it runs between five and ten minutes but anyhow yep you too Carla okay bye-bye okay yeah well it was good talking to you thank you bye  okay i think we're supposed to discuss the changes in the roles of women in the last generation or two and uh-huh right and my opinion is that uh the biggest changes uh probably are about two and one of course is obvious and that's the working woman right and uh the second one which i don't know if you'd go along with or not is that maybe a lot of women are not as uh likely to want to be dominated as past times well that's i would say that's probably true uh i know in in my wife's case she is a very independent sort uh you know she she has a lot of say about uh you know just about everything that uh happens in our family life and you're proud of that and yes i am i i you know i i feel very confident that if you know something were to happen to me or to us either one that uh you know she would be capable of taking care of her own you know what ever her own needs are right and and i think that's very important of course well uh another uh thing that i want to talk about is which of the the changes that you can think of are the most significant well i i really think that that that independence of of women is uh probably more important an and i guess that uh really came about because of the change or a lot of it anyway because of the change in the work force uh with more women working and having uh more uh important or or uh what's the right term anyway their jobs is being you know more people depending on them and more management decisions made i think that uh lends to being you know more independent and stepping out and saying what you want to say and what needs to be said well and don't you think that you do see more women who are um becoming part of middle management yes i i i that's even even uh upper management is is uh i think is going to be a a coming thing for for women too uh and in the professions also not just uh not just within company management but you know professional people that uh are going out on their own attorneys and lawyers i'm an accountant a CPA attorneys and uh i know quite a few women CPA's you know that are out working on their own running their own accounting practice and doing quite well uh-huh let me ask you a question uh while we're talking about the CPA women uh in uh a firm say do you think uh a woman CPA gets paid equally to a man uh i would i'm not sure but i would think so within uh within a public accounting firm uh if they're on the same level of responsibility now i would say that there's you know some um-hum uh or i would even say a probability that women still have it a little more difficult to achieve the same level that a man does uh there's you know there's still some stereotypes uh within even within the the accounting practice what and even within women that they perhaps some women do not expect uh yeah right um but um within public within public accounting within the what is now the big six accounting firms in particular the uh the people that's starting off in accounting uh have an awful lot of uh hours to work and and there's a lot of stress put on them uh a lot of requirements for uh you know traveling and being available all uh hours and and that kind of thing going away on those audits right and and i think that uh that some women may you know they may tend still tend to to not want to do that to the point that they would restrict their own possibility for um-hum uh for promotion to achieve that but you know the ones that the ones that really want to uh certainly can go ahead and achieve that uh-huh yeah well what what future do you see for us in the next twenty years say um i i would say that uh there will be you know in the business world there will be more uh opportunities more expansion of the women's role in business and i see uh women's roles expanding in the political area uh quite a bit uh of course you know we in Texas we've got uh uh a uh woman governor now yes oh yes uh and we've had the all let's see what have we got uh four say five major cities in Texas that have all had women mayors i think uh recently uh three at least three of them have women mayors now Charlotte also has a woman mayor and uh you know i see i see uh you know the movement of women into into the political arena as being very important uh well i'll tell you what worries me a little bit about uh the role of women these days and i'm hoping that that's going to be a change and i don't know if you see it or not my husband doesn't always uh see it or understand it uh and that is the uh the trial of trying to be the superwoman the supermom the yeah the supermom yes yes and uh i have gone through that uh myself and it is hell it really is is tough and to be able to excuse myself uh-huh from doing that was a wonderful liberation and i guess i had i think the woman pretty much has to do it themselves but i believe that in the future that they're going to stop trying to be all things right right i i think they'll be uh you know in in the political area i suppose uh for for the most part politicians have gone through their a a good bit of their business life before they get into politics and and i think that that if that's the the situation for women they will have had their family life and their business life you know may be earlier and then move into politics uh-huh and i think that's uh you know that's the way that uh that you can have you know women can have all things you you just can't have them all at once and uh i think that's you know that's the case for men you know for the most part too yes and a very i will say this very quickly i had an attorney friend who said and he'd been practicing probably twenty five years and he said i wish there were more women in politics they are not quite as crooked uh-hum well i i think that's uh that's the truth and and i i think that there's i think and this is uh may be a bad thing for me to say but i think that women have a higher moral uh character for the most part than men do and it you know the along the sexual type you know the the acceptable the the the little things that men that get involved in morals that we uh-huh yes right that uh women just don't tend to do that of of course it takes you know it takes a man and a women both but i think that women have or or a little more uh discreet or at at least a little more careful about what they do and are and you know are reticent about it anyway woman a woman congressman's not going to have her picture taken on a boat somewhere out in the Caribbean with you know with some young guy you know for the most part yeah uh-huh um-hum however i being uh uh former employer myself i did change from being someone who i who felt that women could uh share out share it one job and things like that and i became more understanding of how men often are are for for many years have thought about uh women in the working world and my husband couldn't believe um-hum and he started teasing me and calling me a male chauvinist or a female chauvinist but but i do i think there certainly some pluses uh on both sides we just need to get them all put together right well it's been so nice talking to you and good luck to you good luck to you and have a nice day bye right and uh yeah it's been nice talking to you too okay thank you you too um-hum you too bye  well Myrna how do you get your news news uh most of it is from the radio uh and also from the news programs that we watch in the afternoon uh-huh yeah we usually watch the local news and the the uh national news both uh-huh yeah i'm pretty much the same i uh i find that uh i'm a graduate student and i i read a lot for school and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because i just i'm reading so much all the time and i really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast well you can always get up and leave that uh-huh that that yeah that's true uh i do i just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper either by the time i get home from work uh-huh it's already you know time for the news to come on that's right yeah so it's so much easier to sit there and besides i can be doing other things and still listening to the news yeah that's right i i agree that's a lot of times i eat while i'm uh watching the news yeah yeah the same thing is there any uh what did you think about the coverage like over in the uh Persian Gulf i think they did a great job yeah i thought so too it was it you know for a while when we were really interested uh we saw it all the time some of the stations i guess carried it for twenty four hours for a couple of days there and then you know the special reports and the extended news coverage i thought was really good uh-huh and you could always find some channel that had something on but you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time yeah yeah right yeah just news that's right yeah yeah i noticed that one thing that that TI did you know they had uh uh they used to have we well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings and they used to have a program called T News and just updates of of different things that were going on within TI well when all the the mess with uh uh uh-huh in the Persian Gulf came about they started carrying CNN oh yeah well now they have had so much good response from this TI now has CNN on all the time uh-huh huh well that's great so we can always run upstairs and you know catch get a quickie update on what's going on if we really want to uh-huh yeah or if you you have a break in the middle of the day you take a coffee break you can always stay informed yeah yeah yeah that's really good that's um i've found that when i i don't have cable television anymore uh when i moved went back to graduate school i just didn't have the money to buy get rent a cable TV line or whatever you know so i don't get CNN uh which was a big disappointment i used to watch that was my if i wasn't home i'm a college teacher and sometimes i teach in the evening so i'll miss the evening news and uh you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on CNN i think that's yes that really has changed the way um i look at the news yeah we don't get it either we live out in the country and we just don't have it available out there where we are uh-huh um-hum but when we did have it uh we that's what we usually watched the weather stations um-hum yeah that's uh same yeah that's when i had it i i watched it you know religiously for half an hour and then you could go on you know to do what else you wanted to do yeah i find i read very little i don't even get a regular newspaper and yeah and uh because uh i i don't drive that much i only live about a mile from where i go to school and work i uh i find i spend so little time in the radio in the car that i don't really listen to the radio you know i don't so so television is my main news source oh i get that too because i i'm in a van pool and i'm in the van you know uh two hours a day an yes yes and in the in the morning i try to sleep because it's it's dark thirty uh-huh oh really to commute to work oh but in but in the afternoon uh i try to read so i can can uh not pay attention to what our driver is doing yeah i can the van pools i know that and i'm in the Baltimore Washington area and i know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas but if you want a nicer home you know beyond the suburbs you know i that's necessary um yeah are are you in Baltimore itself yeah i am i am right outside Baltimore i am less than a mile from the Baltimore line and i go to a block a campus of the University of Maryland that is just less than a mile from my house um so i i'm actually in Baltimore yeah you could say i'm in Baltimore yeah i have two kids over there oh really in Baltimore uh well no in in DC area uh-huh yeah one works for the State Department and uh uh the other one is uh uh her husband is in the Marines Navy and he's stationed at Bethesda and uh-huh oh that's that's that's a really nice area Bethesda area uh-huh it's um it's funny there's a big difference between Baltimore and Washington even though they're so close there's only an hour less than that between the two but there is a big difference in things like property values uh-huh um the closer you get to Washington DC the more expensive it is uh-huh an um the the uh different slant Washington it really is a uh uh an international city where Baltimore is hometown Baltimore you know it there's really uh most people have relocated to the Washington area you know oh no i'd i'd rather have Baltimore with the home town atmosphere yeah that's i i like it i like it a little bit better too it's interesting though um to meet different populations i i'm just now being uh from Pittsburgh originally i'm just now meeting different populations like Chinese students and things and i find that really interesting you know to imagine here is somebody that was in China last two years ago when all that was going on in in uh Beijing you know that that's an interesting uh interesting perspective but i i really much much like the hometown area yeah and i think that also goes it's funny you you can watch different news i can watch Washington news or Baltimore news and i really do watch Baltimore news you know that really makes i don't really bother with the Washington station because i just it's so far removed from what i'm interested in well most of what they're talking about in Washington is is the crime problems that they're having there uh-huh yeah they in fact they just it was just a big thing recently they've had some terrible problems with Hispanics um they had to impose a curfew that uh in two of the areas in uh in the Washington suburbs the mayor they've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then uh brought in yeah and then came a woman that's um she's big in the Democratic party uh-huh i heard about that so that's good so she has good national ties but she also was um something like a uh state auditor or something like that before this position she was a state auditor i guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the District of Columbia at Washington and then she left that to get a position with the Democratic party and now she ran for mayor so she's uh fiscally she's pretty tight and uh she's cleaning house an and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job uh for Washington you know which is you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there you know from what i pick up on the news uh it's a difficult process you know to get rid of a a bad mayor yeah well i know both of my kids didn't want to live anywhere around the the downtown areas they both moved way out right uh-huh yeah i think one of them lives in Germantown and i can't remember where the other one lives yeah but those are nice Germantown is a nice area uh-huh it's a nice area yeah it's means they have to drive a little bit but yeah well they might be car pooling too do they car pool in are they driven by themselves uh well now i i think he carpools because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back but uh now my daughter has they have probably been carpooling together in fact because she had been called back up active duty uh-huh uh-huh oh and then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last Friday so i haven't talked to them this weekend i don't know what the situation is but she was um-hum they didn't call you for mother's day uh we were gone you weren't home huh no we weren't home but she had she had left called and left a message on our recorder but i had that from all my kids except for one yeah oh that's good well i guess we should stop now so well i thank you for calling i have enjoyed it i really do like this program because i get to talk to people from all over the United States yeah uh-huh oh good uh uh so do i i've become very aware of different political views because some of the things we have to discuss are very politically motivated or whatever i i really enjoyed it it's it's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective it's interesting to see the the wider world so i enjoy it hey thanks a lot and and bye thank you bye bye  do you have any interest in gun control do you would you like to start first uh go ahead oh yeah that's right well i thought it was interesting that they gave us a scale um i have to kind of think about that as to exactly where i stand i'm more uh more against gun control than pro i think probably yeah i guess i would pick a five i'm not quite sure i i share an interest of of of guns and i have some guns and i have two brothers-in-law who when we get together we go plinking and and one of them hunts and so it's talked about it um-hum i don't quite understand the NRA's uh CIA type stand it seems to me they'd be guns can become an a hobby and it they they take the approach of uh too too hard nosed on it and i don't quite understand i don't i i i mean i my brother-in-law hunts and and he doesn't need a automatic or semiautomatic gun to hunt agreed agreed and i don't quite understand the the Uzis and all that i think those should be banned i think that uh you oh yeah hunters uh should get whatever they think they need but heck we've had hunting rifles rifles for a hundred years and so uh the military type things they're certainly not Uzis and things like that you know no no i come from a family of hunters and and lots of brothers i have five brothers and and they've all hunted and and my uh in fact i didn't ever even hardly ever even eat beef until i was about five or six years old as my daddy's theory was if you hunt it you better eat it until it's gone and then you go to the grocery store and buy what you need and so we always ate venison and it's still just about my favorite meat oh that's uh oh yeah that i think that's great that's a great attitude and my husband has bow hunted through the years as well as uh hunt with a gun but pretty much now our theory is you know we'll shoot with a camera unless we need to we you know we both know how to hunt and take care of meat if that occasion should ever arise for our family and we own guns we really have not uh this isn't just really great hunting country i mean you know there's not a lot of access you almost have to go like to an indoor range or something to to be able for your children to learn gun safety no right in a safe situation because you assume have to assume in my mind that anyplace that's out far enough where you could shoot somebody else can be out there plinking at you and your kids you know i've never allowed my boys to have BB guns which by the time my brothers were my sons' ages right you know they had plenty of BB guns and used them and everything on you know and it was kind of that you know same kind of theory then you know that uh if you shot it you better figure figure out a way to bring it home and eat it or better not ever let mother know that they had twenty twos yeah well i agree you know that you were out you know indiscriminately taking out birds or squirrels or whatever right you're absolutely there there you go i think that's a that's a i but on the other hand we've eaten a lot of raccoon and possum and turtle all kinds of you've eaten raccoon and possum all my i have a little grandmother in Oklahoma and you know that's she'll cook anything if you bring it in and you know that's and so my brothers would always hunt those things and oh my goodness and you know we're a little more but on on the other hand i i don't have a whole lot of patience with people who who don't want to talk about that kind of the end of animals and yet they're more than willing to go up to Skaggs or you know oh yeah Kroger or whatever and buy their chicken and their meat and come home and cook it And you start talking about hunting and they just cringe and you know ooh you know i i i don't go for that you know i that to me is the other end of the coin that's hiding your head in the sand yeah oh yeah and i i you know i i have a respect for life and for meat i eat it sparingly but when i eat it i know that you know something something had to die for it so even if it was in a butcher lot i uh i don't i don't i don't know why the NRA i always said i'm uh probably a five although i haven't really that's not a very well thought out uh since they gave a number system uh my brother-in-law one of them hunts and the other one is a real collector and we get together we go shooting and i've been a lot of plinking and uh as a kid you know as a teenager we'd go to the rifle range and everything and shoot twenty twos and everything um-hum hum yeah yeah problems we have in society is like today some teenager locally here in the Metroplex used a a twenty two whatever and uh you it's on the news if you listen to the news tonight and went after his teacher and fired three or four shots uh at the school now to me gun control is not going to control it but the parents you know a teenager you know below eighteen or whatever the age should be right uh guns should be an adult should be responsible now i think that if you have a gun an adult that's right how do they get access to that kind of thing you know where then you have a responsibility for whether you call it locking it up or putting it somewhere where absolutely no teenager can get to it or a little child i mean think of the times we've seen that's oh well that includes little kids too yeah you know a criminal a criminal element is kind of out of my realm i mean personally yeah you know i i don't i don't have anybody in my family's ever gone to jail i i've never known anybody personally who used a gun against themselves or you know or or someone else except well i guess i have in a couple of cases of suicide but still that's not exactly the criminal element that i think of as you know what i am saying go down to the local 7-Eleven and right i'm not sure it should be part of a crime bill i think i i i think guns need controls intelligent controls but i don't think it has maybe a one percent relationship directly to crime uh buying Uzis and all that may you know i think that the cops should have the best weapons and whatever they need but i don't think the average uh plinker or hunter needs to go out and buy be able to buy that i don't think he should uh be allowed to buy an Uzi or something and and i understand that these magazines you know and whatnot that cater to that crowd are very uh you know the mercenary kinds of oh yeah things i can't think of some of the names right off but i've heard them that they're just replete with advertisements for these really uh militarily sophisticated types of weapons mercenary type things is what i think of i know it's it's shooting against people you know they go out i i've seen them on TV and they actually have these little clubs where they go out and practice shooting each other you know i mean uh yeah and i i think uh it should be in the hunting realm and targets yeah yeah i don't know why the NRA doesn't have nice range you talk about a range you're right ranges are hard to we have them here in Arlington i have one here in Fort Worth i go to but uh i would think the R NRA would take the positive side and open up some nice practice ranges and teach it you know and rather than just uh try to lobby for it you know they they ought to be come out in the open uh and open up some maybe they do have a lot of good ranges but the ones i go to are just ranges you know i don't well there used to be uh i grew up in Irving we live in Plano now there used to quite a few along the Trinity River Bottom and whatnot that you could go to and out in Euless and uh area uh um out off one fifty seven and you know those are just es extinct now not even available you know they've been built up so much around it's no longer yeah well my my my brother-in-law's in San Antonio and he uh they're they're closing the the ranges they're slowly but surely closing so when i go here in Fort Worth it's in south part of Fort Worth it is run very well of course it has guns uh to buy um-hum um-hum but they have a state trooper i guess he's in his spare time he's always there with a forty five automatic on his side so that that's the only range i've been to that has a cop there and yet you know i would think that a practice shooting range the kind of people that it would generate is the last place you probably really have a problem with guns right no i think that's the i've seen him there are some real amateurs that yeah there's some real amateurs that come i saw one one time when somebody came with with a but it's a nice thought you know non-hunting one of these and he was just swinging you know swinging moving it around waving it around well pardon me so is he there for instruction then is he there for instruction the trooper no he's just there to uh tell everybody hey this is where you aim and watch it you're putting you're endangering the rest of the people ward off trouble yeah yeah yeah and of course when you go and take your targets down he's there to make sure that people uh that's what it was people did not totally totally unload their guns when you you when you take your targets down you walk in front of your own guns and he would just look over everyone's shoulder and say hey your your gun's not unloaded you know you have to unload because you walk out there uh in this particular range uh uh in Fort Worth now the other ranges it's always somebody else but oh the the inspector would come by and say or the rifle range uh owner would come by and look at everyone's gun before he would step in front of you and so you need some sort of common sense as well as expertise with a gun before you put a bunch of dummies out there in front with guns now that's true well i've been very happy with uh you know the the education that my boys have gotten uh through scouting uh they're and my husband they're all scouters and you know a lot of times those things are encouraged you know at uh oh yeah that's great yeah that's a good question yeah the i own i have girls so they haven't been in scouts does does scouting have a gun section where they they teach them twenty twos and all that oh that's great that's great i think that's the way it should be um-hum um-hum see there's scout camps and whatnot but once again you know they don't run a range you know that uh but that still is you know all of that i guess is secondary to they just plink to that criminal mischief element they're always going to create and find something to do yeah yeah i again that's why i don't think it should be part of a criminal or a crime bill because they a legislative type thing i i the ones that want them are always going to get them and the ones that the ones that might need them sometime i mean it's probably just going to make it more difficult you know for yeah but we have to look ahead because we we've had the two hundred years worth of uh or more longer rather we came over with guns four hundred years i guess you might say and i think we have to look at it as it's not going to solve it next week we just got to look uh not now not now for the next ten or twenty years you know what kind of gun uh not controls gun uh legislature should we have and then it'll slowly change it's going to take twenty five years or so maybe to get the the the the guns into a controlled atmosphere where the true hunter you know it has a registered gun and people that allow other children to to get access to a gun should be fined you know  okay uh have you did you have you grown up in Dallas Stephanie uh no i've only been here for the last ten years uh oh where are you from i grew up most of my childhood in Germany in Germany uh and we we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance well now there's a place i'd like to visit so we we traveled all over Europe oh that's neat when i was when i was very young unfortunately a a little bit too young to really appreciate uh-huh uh i was grade school age uh my husband my husband had a bicycle tour of Europe or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war and so we've seen lots of pictures of the of the beautiful spots and areas yeah uh uh that that would be a to me a really nice vacation because i'm i'm not in physical shape for something like that but uh yeah i i sure would work on it if i had an opportunity like that yeah that's neat neat what kind of vacations do you like uh well my husband and i are scuba divers oh huh so we both like to go to dive resorts uh we went to Hawaii on our honeymoon uh-huh and we dove there uh but we we did about six dives while we were there and uh we were originally planning on going to Cayman oh uh-huh uh last year uh-huh uh but we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip we had to have like eleven people for this package uh deal uh-huh oh uh-huh yeah uh and we couldn't get enough people together uh to go so it ended up falling uh falling through we were going to get a really good price yeah when when our children were younger we enjoyed we lived up in uh New York uh-huh or or New Jersey and and used to like uh traveling into upstate New York and camping uh-huh and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and that sort of thing but we've never really uh did any diving or anything little bit of sailing of uh uh oh snorkeling water skiing oh really but not much of uh um of anything else uh well my husband and i both like water so any any vacation that we go on is usually involves close to the ocean or or something like that uh-huh it's got to be the water when when we were in Jersey we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot and really enjoyed that a lot it's really they had yeah we a really nice beach areas there after we moved away from Germany we moved to New Hampshire uh-huh and i lived there for seven years oh i see uh and i really enjoyed that because you know the mountains were real close we like the we like the white mountains and that's a really pretty area too uh-huh no uh unfortunately i didn't really get to go skiing much while i was there i went skiing once yeah we loved the we loved the the New Jersey area too because the the lakes were really pretty close you know you could uh-huh you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and and just really and then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail we did quite a bit of hiking which is kind of fun uh are you a you a hiker or not not so much huh not not really so much if if if there was some place that that we went to where there was hiking involved i i would be you know happy to go hiking but we we never have really planned a vacation around uh places to go hiking uh-huh so your your next your plans are try to find someplace to scuba scuba dive yeah our next vacation will will be scuba diving i'm sure you have any children no not yet okay then that's probably one of the reasons our we had little children all the time so some of the things are not as quite as uh adaptable yeah it is yeah yeah it's a it's a little more difficult planning a vacation when you have have children you have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy too and so i think what yeah yeah and diving is something that especially for small children uh i think the the minimum age for diving is yeah is probably legal anyway would be probably about sixteen eleven or twelve i would think probably but maybe fifteen even i know that uh yeah uh one of one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family you know we go wherever somebody is that we haven't seen for a while so that that's kind of uh we just uh-huh came back from uh uh Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate um from uh with his Master's degree in social work and so that was fun and and the summer we have a we have a a reunion in in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities uh-huh where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of of a rather large reunion group that uh as we can get together so that that sounds like a lot of fun our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that too yeah yeah that there were several hundred uh people and they all kind of met at a central place i i didn't go um uh but it would have been nice it would have been a nice vacation we we've traveled we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe you know like a uh-huh a small camper we've we've traveled in a big one i hate them because they're hard to jockey around you know but maybe a pickup with the back on something or something like uh what's the like the Volkswagen Vanagon i've heard is really nice yeah so you could kind of sleep in it sometimes but you wouldn't want to do it all the time yeah uh we have enough friends here and there i would just love to just drive through the United States and stop and see people i know and visit for a day and then go on and you know uh-huh my dad has been talking for years about uh getting a fifth wheel uh-huh and just picking up he's retired uh he's in his sixties and he uh uh-huh would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there and just yeah you know not be settled anywhere just see see the rest of the country yeah i think it is i think that would real and i would like to maybe not take great long trips but but have your home base where your home is uh-huh and then just travel out for like maybe oh a month maybe go he he does that quite a bit he he hasn't lately though uh because he's been ill and yeah uh but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time and you know he'll say this is my itinerary i'm going here here and here and i'll be back in about two months yeah there are a lot of neat neat places to visit in America that's for sure we've i haven't been much to the south i haven't been in in Georgia or Florida or Mississippi or Alabama i guess that's those are the only states i have not visited but uh up the coast uh at uh uh in Maryland and around there where the where the early history is there's some Johnstown and uh in some in that area is just really neat interesting things to so you know uh-huh have you been a to a lot of the different historical sites yeah we took a trip uh around to the uh Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something i believe it was uh had about three kids then i think but that was a really fun interesting trip i uh-huh we we read Bruce book before we went you know and so we were ready to look up the places we read about it was really interesting yeah i i think right right now while my husband and i don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and and adventurous types of things and then when we eventually when we have kids yeah yeah yeah now his his folks did a lot of traveling across country you know they went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that yeah well now camping is fun with kids if you're you know once they get a little bigger not teeny tiny ones but even even some little ones do pretty good but but when they get a little bigger so they can help that that's a fun way to to uh cut costs and it's enjoyable too very restful yeah yeah yeah i i do enjoy camping i mean i find yeah i find the outdoors very relaxing and you know kind of a change as long as i have a shower nearby i'm fine and electricity yeah well i'm with you i need my creature comforts too well it was great to talk to you yeah it was nice talking to you too Beth okay see you later bye-bye okay bye-bye  are you satisfied with the public school system in your area uh well we don't have children but um from what our peers tell us um most of them do are not in favor of the way the Dallas public well i shouldn't get specific the way the public education system is run here okay um they just don't feel that um the quality of the teachers and the quality of the uh curriculum and they actually send them to uh the suburban areas i i guess it's okay if i say the area Plano sure uh-huh um and i think one thing that the state's doing right now about the refunding i think is completely unfair it's not that i yeah i don't agree with that either the the Robin Hood approach where the rich give to the poor yeah yeah is is that the basic reason you don't agree with it no i don't people move to the suburbs to Richardson and Plano uh uh mostly because of the school district because of the level of education that's offered yeah yeah and they're already paying for it i mean i you know um i know we used to live in Garland and a lot of the people there sent their kids to private school because um they just didn't like what was going on yeah well it costs uh so much in taxes here and uh even if they do give money to the poorer school districts i don't think it's going to lower my taxes at all uh-huh i know it i mean i look at high schools like um what was the one in Richardson J J Pearce High School that just won the national academic some kind of um uh championship or tournament that they had for academics and that Richardson is one of the school districts that would be hit by taking away from them yeah sure that's a good way to say it the Robin Hood um approach well that's that's exactly what what their doing um yeah i don't think that's going to improve the talent as far as the school teaching uh goes you know i used to work at EDS and Ross Perot you know the big joke sometimes um about him but the one thing he did a few years back in testing the competency of the uh faculty yeah i still think that's a good idea well i think it is too uh every because i don't i don't know where did you go to school in Texas no i went to school in Wisconsin and i went to school in Chicago so i can tell you it's probably the same type of thing that um i had a really good education but it wasn't where i went to high school it was an inner city but it the faculty was very good right uh-huh well we need qualified teachers no matter whether they're teaching in the inner city or the suburbs and i don't know what you right uh the trouble is that uh the suburbs are able to pay more that's going to attract the the better uh teachers uh-huh which is understandable i mean i'd go where i would be compensated the most sure and uh it cost more in tax money too so yeah i mean it's yeah in Texas i don't know i don't if it's because of um the influx of minority uh in terms of that they're trying to please all people and their not pleasing anybody you know i don't know if that's what it is well it could very well be uh there is a definite racial split here i don't know i'm not really yeah i mean i don't know if that's exactly it or not but it seems to be a little bit more um well i don't know schools in Wisconsin i'm trying to think of some of the things i know about the schools up north compared to down here it just seems like down here that unless you're in a suburban entity their SAT scores their reading comprehension levels they're just not as high well i was in a rural area in Wisconsin and uh we had a good public school system but i don't think it was great i think the curriculum was very deficient to prepare people to go to college uh-huh uh-huh but uh the the racial mix of um students in my area was entirely white we had uh no minorities at all and mine was uh mine was completely um Hispanic in terms of Puerto Rican uh Caucasian and eastern European okay well that's interesting uh it was very eclectic um but the teachers were what did curriculum i mean they had things like philosophy and journalism i mean huh but there wasn't a uh real for people such as myself that knew they wanted to go to school and knew they wanted to um go to a fairly competitive undergraduate program it wasn't what i would call a uh a career a academic path preparatory path for college prep um as opposed to suburban schools like Evanston Illinois which has one of the largest you know right uh student bodies in the country and the and the money base to go with it um sure i don't know i just look at high schools like Plano East and West and the ones in Richardson and i think well you know i would send a child there well the good school districts here do have honors programs uh they do encourage that among the students who are uh prepared to go to college but uh that brings up a whole uh bunch of other problems um uh-huh uh-huh yeah i mean my high school did have honors programs and i was in it but it really you know in terms of i'm wondering how much different it was compared to in terms of city now there is a high school um is it WTT White or is it Jefferson i don't know that much about the Dallas high school system um but i have heard that the of one or two that are very good but out of how many you know fifty to sixty high schools sure it's just um and then i read the other day that Plano was going to be the site for a possibly new um parochial or Catholic high school all right i haven't heard that yet something like to be one of the largest ones in the Southwest or something yeah that's interesting i know some people at work who uh have uh children in high school and they're not satisfied with the school district at all and they do send their kids to the private school private schools uh-huh do they see and are they in Plano or are they in Dallas Dallas um they send them to Saint Marks i think where ever that's located okay yeah yeah that's one of the more um yeah i have some friends that uh have younger children and they send them to the Montessori system yeah uh-huh um and when you hear what they're paying you just well he he said about six hundred a month and that doesn't include their personal expense oh my goodness so you're you're talking about uh college uh level fees here yeah twelve years and you add more than one child to that and you say oh my goodness yeah i sure but i think i think the honors programs are good in the high schools but uh some of the problems you get are the kids that are in those programs get harassed by their peers for doing too well this is true yes i can personally relate to that yes and that discourages them from doing well uh-huh i don't know i think one thing the United States does um my stepfather's from England and one thing they do their at least in in the section of London where he was from that they um so uh they actually they call them externships but they actually the child's um uh they go by forms they don't go by grades and i guess i guess what would be the equivalent of our early high school nine tenth grade they call it the tenth of eleventh form um yeah they actually are forced to take time off and pick an area of study it's proctored it's you know regulated and all that sort of thing um but they actually are supposed to go to the library and do their own thing on a particul ar subject and it doesn't matter what it is uh-huh it has to be academic but they it's free of their choosing well their allowed to progress at their own pace then right in that one just for that one particular semester quarter or what ever you know that one quarter uh a study unit would be and all right i don't know i don't think we do enough of that here in terms of getting children to think independently no i can relate to part of that uh in in my high school uh say just for for example in my math courses uh i i was not to brag about this at all i was so far ahead of everybody else that i didn't have to go to class uh-huh oh my and i got to sit by myself in an empty room while everybody else was in class taking algebra and work at my own pace uh-huh see yeah that's kind of what i'm talking about i mean um uh i mean we can only speak from personal experience and i'm not bragging either but it's the same thing i mean i took AP or advanced placement classes sure and it there were things that i probably knew about in other segments but they just didn't offer them i mean they offered them in things like English and chemistry yeah two things that were obscure to what i was interested in in terms of um a career um i think part of the thing about schools today is too is the way the families have gone down the tubes the structure that now teachers play police officers you know their parenting their disciplinarians yeah i'm sure that has a definite effect yeah you know and i'm doing this all this second hand we don't have any kids in school or anything so i can't well i i know people uh i don't have any kids either but uh from i know people who had been neighbors once upon a time uh-huh who had kids and whenever the father was traveling away on business or they they had financial problems their kids uh their it was definitely noticed at their performance in school isn't that something i mean are parents i mean my folks were divorced too but i can't remember ever i mean it was sort of just like uh you knew you had to study or you just didn't yeah it got so bad with with this one kid that uh the the school uh called their parents up to ask if there were any problems going on oh goodness because his performance at school had degraded so much i mean i wouldn't want to be growing up now a days that's one thing um but i don't know how you solve that you know those are social problems the academic problem i don't know i think of two or three things in my mind i think teachers should be tested i i believe in that and they probably would shoot me if they heard that and i know a lot of teachers um two i think that they should leave the funding or the money where the proven programs are yeah and three i do think that parents need to be more involved i don't know i just it's probably easy to say because none of us have children but um i just right well i remember as a kid uh they had PTA Parent Teacher Association meetings all the time yeah association yeah and uh my parents always went to those uh yeah mine too i mean and do they have those anymore i mean i don't even i i don't know i don't have any uh but you know just the other day we were somewhere actually on Saturday we were in the Park Cities ordering in a we were in a specialty uh food shop ordering something to send out of state and the man we were all upon the topic of adoption which may be in our future um if we're real lucky at any rate he was saying how he was glad that his two children one biological one natural um this had to do with the adopted the adopted one which biological i mean one adopted one natural um that's irrelevant but he was saying that uh my husband said and what does your son is very good looking what is he well he's nineteen he graduated last year um but he's interested in theater and he's just going to Richland and he said you know he said i'm not calling him stupid or slow he just he said he did really didn't want to study and he goes and you know he leaned over to my husband and he said well you know so and so he said when you have them if you get one what you'll understand is you'll just be glad if they don't you don't get a call from the police sure and he said our son Mark you know blah blah blah um he may be have only been a C student but we've never had trouble with him he said and when you raise a child in today's society he you're just glad they make it through school uh-huh yeah well the the dropout rate is so high in Dallas and Fort Worth uh yes it is i i think it's thirty eight percent is it see i don't even know that  okay do you vote regular yeah i do i try and vote in every single election every one but uh that's just since in the past say about six years before that i really didn't pay any attention at all well see that's me i've never paid any attention to voting oh you haven't hum-um yeah i didn't use to but now i really because i get so angry about what goes on and then i feel like i can't really complain too much unless unless you have something to do with it right yeah but the problem is that i am very liberal politically and so i hardly ever have anybody that wins that i vote for oh liberal by what do you mean by liberal um liberal politically i'm you know like pretty left wing Democrat Democrat so well see i don't know anything about politics oh you don't uh what's the main what's the main difference between Republicans and Democrats okay well there's a lot of them um depends on what issue you're talking about but Democrats are on a lot of issues are more liberal than Republicans and well it used to be it's kind of hard to say now especially after Desert Storm but um i think back in the eighties times when uh my political opinions were being formed like in Vietnam during the Vietnam war and stuff uh-huh the Republicans were more you know what they called Hawks which is more like aggressive in war and more pro-war and pro-aggression and um uh-huh the Democrats were the doves they were more for peace and i'm not sure how much that holds true anymore i think you know the issues are okay and you vote for the Democrats or yeah yeah and Democrats usually are supportive more supportive of public assistance programs and and programs to usually okay uh-huh um the the big Republican thing is that they don't they vote for less government they want less government involvement in society and so they're more less apt to vote in you know more aid to people or more uh-huh more uh they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things huh so so have you ever voted at all okay no i never have you haven't hum-um how old are you i'm twenty six oh gosh i know i should i well well i don't know much that much about it i don't keep up on it and i don't feel like i have uh-huh uh-huh have enough knowledge on it to even you know to pick the right person yep yeah well so that's what they need well uh-huh it uh they said something to improve voting uh-huh if they could make it more oh easier to find out you know what's going on do you know what i mean yeah yeah like uh like to me i don't i didn't know what would have been wrong with i can't even remember who ran for president against Bush i think it was uh that woman wasn't it a woman Dukakis no it was Dukakis Dukakis from Massachusetts okay didn't he have a woman or wasn't or was that Reagan there was a woman that was running for vice president for a while Ferraro oh yeah that was yeah Ferraro that was a while ago that was a couple elections ago yeah okay yeah that's okay well well that's what i mean like i didn't know what the difference between Dukakis and Bush was um-hum you know i didn't know anything about Bush or Dukakis so what do you think about uh what do you think about what you see on TV about them like in the news or on the ads do you kind of just okay i don't remember anything about Dukakis you don't but well they're all saying that they're going to do you know whatever is best for their campaign anyway uh-huh uh-huh that's what i mean if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and i don't know like you know in school they didn't teach you about Democrats uh the government not really um-hum right you didn't get any government classes hum-um yeah it's really hard too because before they used to have um a lot of it seems like the stuff that they put out now it i mean i doesn't just seem like it i know for a fact that the any kind of stuff that if you wrote and asked for material well what do you believe in what do you believe in they don't take any stands on anything they kind of say well what do you want me to believe yeah or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues well i'm not sure they're yeah i know how they do it it like it with the abortion issues and stuff um-hum um-hum yeah they have to kind of take a stand on some things like abortion and uh-huh things like that so that's kind of how i judge there's a few things where they have to say yes or no like abortion or gun control or let me see i try to look at right what if some of the newspaper articles or the i don't trust TV as much but newspaper articles can show whether how they voted in the past right and but you get you know it all depends again on whose writing it and who they're for because they can slant that too right and like i said most of the politicians the politicians i'm the also the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway um-hum yeah yeah and everybody's got you know stuff they don't want known right everybody's got a secret well anyway i'm sorry i didn't i didn't have so much knowledge i don't even remember this being on there well that's okay do you think do you think um i mean what would it take like that this is really good actually that for to talk to somebody who hasn't voted i mean what kind of how would it how what kind of stuff would they would you like them to do so that that you would know more about it like send stuff in the mail or have it at the library or incentive you i guess that would be good now i'm sure they've got it at the library um-hum you know um-hum i mean if i get to the library i've got two babies so i don't oh do you yeah that'll tie you down a little bit yeah but i i don't know or do you just not do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote or oh i know if enough people think like that it you know would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that yeah yeah um well a lot of people they'll vote the way their family votes you know if since you're what Democrat uh-huh um-hum yeah then then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote Democrat right um-hum well not in my family we're kind of really independent i mean no all split but a lot of families do that i know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote right and that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved golly i lie hm but well i don't know if i did understand politics i probably would vote more but like i said if i voted for Bush or like when uh Gary um-hum Hart Hart was running uh-huh a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking not that i think he was good looking but yeah he was young yeah and then i didn't think that was right because he may have been a good president or whatever um-hum but because it was he had an affair yeah and it just threw him out of the whole running yeah yeah and a lot of people go by their uh personal life when they vote um-hum yeah and which i guess if you got turmoil in your personal life you're going to let it come into work but um-hum i'm sure there's a lot of people that have had i think everybody does it just depends on how well you can hide it yeah you know and i that's very true i i think that doesn't really have that much to do with um unless they've done something really horrible you know or something real abnormal well criminal or something like that's different but yeah right but otherwise if him and his wife weren't getting along i mean um-hum what is what effect does that have on him running for president do you know what i mean yeah yeah it's all so secretive see we really don't see the that's right true person anyway i think that's that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country's being run is that um the the election the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that you know that really don't have anything to do with how well they do the job but see they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with what right you know the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no and if they don't say yes or no then maybe somebody'll vote for them that wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side do you know what i'm saying so they just try and make it a personal thing i mean if you remember right any of the TV commercials from the last presidential campaign they all had uh pictures of Bush with his grandchildren walking around with his grandchildren and even from Reagan it was all just like looks like a McDonald's commercial you know uh-huh well what did you think of Reagan as a president that's about what it looked like i just thought he was really inept i don't think he did anything at all he they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet and the people that were do you think he won from Carter because of the um the hostages that were held at that time well i think that was part of it i think there's a lot of the the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the the recession and stuff people just had a picture of Carter as not being real capable um-hum but he actually all right this i thought he was great i thought Carter was good too and that was yeah did you i always liked him i thought he was great at the time and i i just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him i you know that i just couldn't believe that he got voted out but i think i wasn't well let's see that's been about ten years ago right um-hum yeah okay so i was only fifteen or sixteen but i remember Carter and i liked him yeah yeah you did have you heard stuff about him lately do you know what he's doing no i sure don't well he is just he is really active still politically he's been overseas you remember when he was in office he did a lot of stuff for the Middle East for people  okay well let's start with you okay um the last movie i saw was the Five Heartbeats and i liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it Five Heartbeats yeah it's who who was in that it's uh Robert Townsend movie okay um i i don't know all the actors or anything but it was just it was a lot of music a lot of old songs things like that when was it out um it's still out now uh it came out i guess about a month or about a month and half ago something like that it's about a black singing group it and uh it was called the Dells um-hum and uh it was kind of like just about their their life and their uh history and things like that and the way they went from from how they went from stardom to non stardom yeah and uh that was pretty good i enjoyed i saw Dances with Wolves have you seen that yeah that's yeah i saw that one that was pretty good uh that won yeah best picture i think uh-huh and Costner got best director yeah right now Kevin Costner i mean he's starring in everything he's doing the Kennedy movie that's coming out um and there's one yeah yeah starring Kevin Costner another Kennedy movie huh and let me see what else um he's doing some other movie i can't i think Robin Hood that's it the Robin Hood movie coming out and he's going to be in also and let me see what else have i seen what have you seen one comes to mind here and i can't i'm not sure about the name has Meryl Streep and um what was the name of that anyway the basis the premise of the story is that uh uh uh you go to a place after you die you go to a place called Judgment City oh i know what you're talking about and um anyway uh i can't remember the other the other actor uh my it's called Reviewing My Life or something like that yeah and and uh yeah i didn't get to see that Defending Your Life Defending Your Life and it's it's an excellent movie uh it's pretty entertaining uh yeah that's it okay um-hum hm let's see what else have i seen lately um one of my favorite movies it's not one that i've haven't seen i well it's not a late movie it's uh Home Alone Fatal Attraction okay yeah it's probably my all time well not all time favorite but one of my favorites that i can watch over and over yeah did well did you ever see Home Alone no i never did i i heard it was really good i've never just haven't gone out to see it was that pretty funny that was a that was a that was a good one too yeah it's pretty good and um yeah yeah somehow just never made it to see that but i need to see it i don't know i can't believe i'm just drawing a blank um because i've seen yeah Fatal Attraction that i don't know why i like that movie so much i guess it was so much suspense um-hum and i like suspense that kinds of reminds me like uh did you ever see this is going way back uh Jagged Edge yes uh-huh yeah on that order certainly is that that was a good one too yeah but uh and i liked the woman that played in that i forgot what her name is now yeah that's Anne Archer she's the one she was the wife in Fatal Attraction oh okay yeah and she played in uh Narrow Margin which was a little more recent um-hum and that was kind of another suspense type Alfred Hitchcock type thriller that was good yeah um God i guess i haven't seen too many movies lately i need to i haven't seen a whole lot either but i know i'm drawing a blank on yeah what i've seen um-hum and just somehow i mean i it's hard for me to get to the movies now because it's getting so expensive you know i'd i'd rather rent i know it's it's obnoxious because you go in there and you spend six bucks a ticket but then you end up spending another six dollars on food yeah yeah and that's just for a bocket a bucket of popcorn you know yeah and a pop you know so it's it gets pretty yeah God forbid you should want something to drink with it but uh yeah like if i so if i take a date it it it cost me you know twenty bucks easy uh-huh oh yeah easily and uh i don't know and usually going to do usually going to go to a dinner go to dinner or something with that i was going to say you you know you can find certain restaurants that are nice and have good food for yeah eat eat for thirty dollars it's almost more fun really yeah it's almost more fun really to rent movies you know just kind of stay at home maybe yeah the problem is you always have to wait until they're out yeah that's true too so that's what you're yeah you're uh dealing with but then you can make your popcorn and you know be comfortable that's true that is true so um-hum um well that's about all the movies i've seen recently i ought to open the paper here because i know i've seen a few that have that played but um yeah i just can't come up with any names here haven't haven't been to one for a little while um-hum but um did you ever see Kindergarten Cop it's no i never did that was pretty good was that Arnold Schwarzenegger yeah um-hum yeah yeah but um there's a movie i do want to see uh i haven't seen it what is it oh Kiss Before Dying okay it looks it looks pretty suspenseful yeah whose in that um-hum another one i saw is called the Object of Beauty i don't remember recommend that as much as uh Defending Your Life but it was it was all right kind of funny um but um what else has been on and about um-hum are you looking in the paper oh yep i'm trying to i wanted to get to the Silence of the Lambs i hear that oh yeah that was great pretty oh did you see that yes that was that that might be one of my all time favorites too that was an excellent movie yeah it was pretty scary because i was visiting a VA Hospital uh near to where i live and they were saying that some of the patients there you can't leave by themselves because they'll make a weapon out of anything um-hum you know out of a piece of paper they can kill somebody you know and this guy in Silence of the Lambs Hannibal Lector he was he was that kind of person and you they couldn't leave him alone and that's that's what was so scary about the movie um-hum um-hum you know since he was such an awesome character you know i mean it was it was really fascinating he was very dangerous but you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating hm hm but but they couldn't leave him alone at all and they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time but i won't tell you that just in case you see the movie yeah i'll probably try to go see um-hum to see it in a little while here but it's been out for a while oh very good oh yeah oh yeah i'm not sure when it'll be hitting video stores but it should be a while yet though you heard anything on like Out for Justice oh i haven't heard anything about it i but i don't like Steven Seagal things uh they're just kind um has he had very has has he had very many other movies out he's had Out For Justice and there was one right before that with a similar title like uh i don't know some i don't know some macho title that's why i i just don't like the because it's a macho movie yeah it is i i don't i don't like that a lot i don't watch a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger or anything like that either speaking of that i think Terminator 2 is supposed to be out yeah yeah that might be good though that might be good i don't know i've enjoyed a lot of his movies uh they just uh they're action filled and they're a little bit of humor and um-hum um-hum um-hum uh the i guess i i'm not fond of the action packed movie where they're always chasing or fighting or you know i like the more movies that make you think yeah did you ever see um um Sleeping with the Enemy no i haven't seen that yet and that's something i really should have seen was that good did you see it i haven't i haven't heard much lately i just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews um-hum yeah a friend of mine saw it and she said it was okay yeah you know it wasn't anything spectacular you expect more out of uh Julia Roberts though but the yeah the previews looked so good that i wanted to see it but i never did uh did you ever see the original FX movie yeah well i saw half of it and i remember i was in school i saw half of it and i fell asleep and everyone else watched it oh okay because i was going to say i always enjoyed that i i uh i remember that movie and uh it was i mean i got into it uh-huh um-hum and uh they have F FX 2 out yeah yeah yeah i don't know if i really need to go see the original one i'm sure it was a good movie i just i probably had a test that day or something i don't know uh yeah it was one of those that has a lot of twists in it yeah it it's it's it's it's uh yeah um-hum i can't put it exactly on the lines of the Jagged Edge but it you know it uh kind of on that end you know you get these twists and um-hum yeah and that um-hum um-hum it's usually pretty good but uh i think i think though that movies are losing their luster kind of i think movies are losing their attractiveness just to a lot of people just i think i don't know because of the cost and i think it it's just losing its originality what's that or something i don't i can't pinpoint pinpoint it but it doesn't seem like it's as big uh rage to get to the movie theater as it used to be yeah yeah that's probably true i i i just um-hum you see the same story lines different characters and um-hum yeah exactly um i don't know it's it's it's it's it's it's hard to say and i know i don't um-hum you know i'm i don't keep up with it right you know but uh i don't try to just just just for that reason reason it is a cost it does cost a lot so why um-hum um-hum go out and see something right away wait you know you kind of wait and if something gets really good reviews maybe you'd finally go spend the twelve bucks you know to go to it right right um-hum but um you know i haven't been to a grand an opening for oh you know ages um-hum just because  okay perhaps uh maybe we were a little unsure because we were looking at something broader you know nationwide worldwide or something maybe we should look city wide okay you know or school board wide or you know what i'm saying narrow the topic a little and see if if we don't uh recognize some trends there oh okay okay um one thing that i definitely have noticed in our area as far as the school system at least uh token wise i'm not sure that uh really truly uh um-hum uh we're effectively counting but at at least for a show we're involving more parents in input and more parent input um-hum um-hum um like i say this all may be in name only um-hum kind of thing at this point but at least it's a step in the right direction i think well do you have school age children i have five school age children oh so you're you're definitely more involved at least in the schools school system my children are grown so um-hum yeah so well we uh we try to keep abreast of it uh of some of the things that are that are going on and we've uh we've just gone through some city elections here in in Plano for our city council for city council do you all have a mayor or yes yes you do yeah we we do in Houston too uh-huh uh-huh Whitmire is is she still the yeah yeah she's still she's still there but it looks like uh she may have some the opposition or they're they're trying to beat them she's been in for so long so we may hear some interesting things about her before election time comes up um-hum this time but she's uh uh okay i don't know is would a trend does it seem to be we're having more minority type people women in government yes as far as in the local like our our our our our chief of police is a woman our our mayor is a woman our superintendent superintendent of of schools was a woman she's just now you know been pushed out um-hum um-hum but i don't know if you would consider that a trend or not oh i definitely think it's a trend uh you know this morning on the way to school we just uh it just so happened that we saw a lot of buses and i usually don't have all my children in the bus in the car at once but i'd taken them all to the chiropractor this morning one big fell swoop and then we were going on to school but just a tad late long enough for the buses to be going back and you uh the kids said gosh look how many of these bus drivers are women and i said you know that really is a good indication of some of the jobs that have been uh-huh you know that trend that has swung you know one profession that you know there are a lot of women now and i think it's good because um-hum um-hum those women sometimes pick up on those kids emotional needs and might you know be aware of those things coming or going from school where maybe the men don't always you know they're just there to drive the bus you know and the women are more well i saw uh the the superintendent that we've had was being considered for the superintendent in the Boston area uh-huh and they just she just lost out to someone from the Dallas area like assistants somebody who's an one of the assistants in your i'm not sure what the name maybe it was another woman uh-huh uh-huh so must have been from uh DIS maybe so yeah maybe so but i definitely think think that administratively in the schools women are are a show of force now that we did not see even five years ago certainly not you know ten years ago up to that point they were allowed to be teachers secretaries nurses so forth even your uh heads of uh you know like your food services that kind of thing uh-huh your your deans you know they weren't women um you know that's lots of school principals seem to be women in the at least in the Houston area yes i've noticed over over the years that my kids were in school uh-huh uh-huh more and more fact i don't even remember any uh school that they went to that there there wasn't a women principal from elementary school on up on uh-huh oh that's excellent excellent you know that they're getting a chance so yeah but but then again you know it would be nice to have more you know the majority of teachers seem to be women it would be nice to have but the problem is the pay scale probably it's because you know women go into teaching probably not so much for the money but uh for the satisfaction and that's just what they want to want to do whereas uh i think if you're a college professor the type of uh probably the pay is much better and you tend to see more i think you see more uh-huh well i don't know it seems like there there are a lot of a lot more men at least in the the college level so well and that comes once again you know is that you can teach in elementary school you can even substitute in elementary school in the state of Texas without a uh without a certificate you can teach yes you can substitute teach without a certificate or a degree substitute right and then you know work on that and if you want to work on up but you still can make good money you know uh part-time part-time money as a substitute whereas you know to teach on college level you have to have a PhD almost always sometimes you can get by on a fellowship program or something where you might be teaching but uh-huh do you do you have any idea how much uh uh a substitute teacher would make per day i'm sure they pay them by the day uh-huh here in Plano they pay about fifty dollars a day well i mean that's good part-time money that's good part-time money for but it's not career money yeah but it's not no you know but it uh course it you know you know for a part-time situation just somebody and once you've gotten your foot in the door for several years substituting and then take on a degree you know you're pretty well assured of a of a job in the system eventually that you know that you've been subbing in a lot of times you know i think that's uh i think uh one thing that uh that we're seeing you know a trend in uh politics is that our cities are taking a lot more responsibility for uh citizens becoming involved in the environment uh yes it's true recycling uh clean up programs refurbishing you know historical and and uh park land uh-huh um your uh city you know where they they adopt a highway kinds of things those are becoming more and more uh-huh government uh originated and not just private enterprise uh-huh you know generated which i think is something that has to happen in order to to make people do it probably to make it happen right which you know i thought Texas would be the last place to ever um get people to do those things voluntarily and i think their don't mess with Texas campaign has been very effective because Texans don't like to be told what to do they're very proud of their state so they've psychologically they've done a number on us there well a couple weeks ago i was at the Houston International Festival which is you know in the downtown area and uh-huh uh-huh uh the friend a friend of mine that was with me uh commented on on how clean uh you know when you have an event like that of course everybody you know there's just food and everything else and of course they have the the you know the places to throw the stuff but you really they were really use they really use it uh-huh because in the past you know it seemed like i can remember people just just throw it down they don't care but you're you're finally getting to the point where it's just kind of second nature to find some place to to throw it um-hum um-hum uh can you remember driving down the highway i could as a kid you know you just get rid of it you roll the window down and you throw it out but you wouldn't well my mother was always real picky about that kind of thing i think i'd probably have my fingers cut off if i'd ever thrown out a candy wrapper or anything but well you're probably younger than i am because i you know um but i can remember uh probably probably uh in the early seventies uh going out on you know taking our boat out and stuff like that and looking for places for trash bins and stuff and that was very new at that time you know uh-huh um-hum that that so it's uh yeah it really hasn't been that long i mean it's probably twenty years or so that you know it really began yes yes so yeah i agree for it to and to be adopted and funded uh-huh you know by cities and you think the incredible amount of you know money that we vote for our cities to spend on these kinds of things so you know it's definitely uh you know you have to consider that a political trend because we're the ones voting for those people you know to that are in favor of those kinds of programs and make them you know campaign issues that's true so how about the representation that you have on the city council is it uh you know we're we're i think we're to vote going to have increased the number so that we will be able to represent uh like the Mexican Americans don't feel like they've had enough representation and stuff like that uh-huh well of course Dallas is in a great upheaval right now over the fourteen one and ten four one you know programs and it's you know going back and forth between courts to you know what is that i'm um have to be plead ignorant here the um  all right Clarice uh what's your favorite basketball team well Mavericks probably the one that plays here the Mavericks yeah the Mavericks uh they're not doing the greatest that i've seen them play before but uh well they're doing okay yeah they didn't quite make the play-offs though but but no no i i think without uh Roy Tarpley they're he he added something to the team but uh i think they need to let him go maybe but yeah he doesn't seem to course i have a lot of players that i think are really super i think Isaiah Thomas is just great and uh i think uh he yeah he does really well i like to watch him play he just has a really good moves and uh i don't know i i guess uh uh-huh uh i guess i like to watch the Mailman play for the the Utah team uh when he delivers he does okay and uh uh yeah uh-huh i can't think of the name of the team that has Larry Bird on it oh the Celtics i like to watch them play the whole team i like their whole team oh the Celtics the they are a team is what's really good about them yeah yeah they just uh work the ball and uh pass around and make each other look good yeah um-hum i you know like i said i like Isaiah Thomas but i think sometimes that uh that uh he he sometimes ends up being a one man team uh whereas the Celtics like you said they play more as a team um yeah makes it little more fun to watch at times yeah i like Michael Jordan a lot too he's really good uh yeah Danny Ainge he plays i like Danny Ainge okay you like Danny Ainge why do you like Danny Ainge that that's i mean you've named like four of the top names in the game and then you come up with Danny Ainge well i well i guess because he played at at my alma mater so i i kind of watch him every now and again did he play BYU oh you went to BYU huh okay yeah yeah yeah and he played really well when he was there so yeah uh it's it's hard to uh name him with some of the very top players i think sometimes but i'm glad he's playing in the in the pros yeah he's a yeah he's uh well i have nothing against him i just uh you just wondered why i named him huh i wondered yeah i wondered everybody has their their favorite you know maybe not the the big name player but uh yeah he's playing a vital role he he's playing for Portland he's playing for Portland he's i mean he's coming in and doing a good job he's it was a great trade how they got him Portland um-hum right now yeah they yeah i i liked when he uh he was playing with Celtics and then he traded to Portland um-hum and uh it was a good trade so seems like uh i don't know if it's mainly because of him but it seems that he plays for top teams and uh you know contenders uh he might have uh did he go straight from Boston to Portland or did he hit another team on the way um i don't remember i really don't it seems like he went straight there you know because i don't remember him playing for another another team other than straight through but uh yeah yeah yeah but uh yeah he's uh i i like to watch him play because he's a yeah he's pretty tough you know he's he's a scrappy guy so what's your favorite team he's a competitor do you have a favorite team yeah oh do i have a favorite team uh well i'm from Indiana so i like the Pacers and uh uh i like Larry Bird because he's from the home state also uh-huh i just likewatch him play anyway uh yeah let's see i like the Bulls because they're from the Chicago area and uh they've uh suffered through many a hard season before they got Jordan yeah yeah yeah and uh even then once they got him they didn't make the play-offs for a couple years they had to gradually build up a supporting cast because you can't just win with one player in the NBA you have to have a a you know a good solid team um-hum even though one player can carry a bulk of the of the scoring load you know you have to have the other players there to complement him and finally with uh Pippen and some of the Horace Grant some of the other guys are coming right along i watched uh well i didn't watch them but i i saw in the newspaper and in on the news the play-off teams and and without Larry Bird and and Michael Jordan when they got injured you know it was interesting i think then how their teams did um uh-huh how it it it brought the scoring down a little bit but their teams stayed relatively together you know and so yeah you know i think sometimes it's interesting we we really watch the big name players and but they have to have a solid team underneath or else they really don't don't go anywhere uh-huh so i i think that's kind of the Mavericks problem they have okay players but sometimes the strongness of the team isn't together yeah you know every once in a while they click during a a game and then it works for them but then it's just not always there yeah so i i guess that's well they made a couple trades this this year that uh well Fat Lever was hurt most of the year yeah and that so they didn't get to reap any benefits from that and uh i don't know how well Alex English did but English did okay he did okay okay but uh see see we don't have a TV so i didn't get to watch any of the Mavericks i think i got to watch probably one game all year so oh i think Adubato as the coach of their team uh has done a lot a lot for them yeah i think he he's uh brought some strength to that team um um he he's really trying hard he's a nice guy i like him as the coach of the Mavericks so i don't i don't know a lot of coaches in the in the NBA though well they move around so much yeah that's true can't hardly keep a one coach where he's at for very long enough to get know who he is yeah that's true that's true yeah i think uh like you said i mean Tarpley if he was had his life straightened up he could really help a ball club but you know the way well he's operating now he's more of a detriment than anything else yeah i think they're i think they'll let him go they should anyway i i uh i like basketball it's a fun sport i i like to watch it i like to um yeah i guess i like it because of of the quickness of it um and and i like it because it takes the players have to be you know it's not a game where you can just not practice i mean they have to be on the top of their game to be i n the NBA i think uh-huh right yeah or else top physical condition too yeah yeah so do you like college basketball high school ball anything like that i don't watch much of that i watch our town Plano uh Plano East is where my children will go i have an eleven year old son and he plays basketball and my son my husband coaches his team uh-huh um-hum and uh they uh i think they were one off one loss to the play-off oh and uh i like to watch our Plano East Senior High boys play they are they did really well so yeah good i like yeah i do like um the the games not only basketball but the other ones too that the high schools play i keep up with that yeah so yeah i i it's fun watching basketball at all different levels i mean there are benefits and and bad points of watching it each each different one i mean you may not see a spectacular Michael Jordanish move from a high school player but you know it's more of an accomplishment if if they hit yeah you know some three pointers or something the game is you know it's just a different game pretty much but that's sort of what makes it fun yeah yeah well you know what i think is you know like Spud Webb i mean um-hum you can really even if you're short like that you know in basketball today they get these huge tall players that uh-huh that just are you know if you want to do it bad enough i think it's a possibility in anybody's life yeah he's he really goes for it and he's a good little player you know so oh yeah he's i think if if any of these boys want to do it they really can if that's really their dream yeah yeah so takes work though that's the big yeah yeah takes a lot of working well Spud was just gifted with a exceptional vertical leap and that's what helps him out more than anything else yeah yeah plus you know he's like you said he's worked hard at it i'm sure well i just think that basketball's a fun game and and i guess i still have to stick with the Mavericks i guess as far as yeah  so you like to fish huh yeah i like to um i don't have a boat but i like to fish and there's a lot of lakes around here um are there many lakes up there yeah actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me we actually uh we have the those little the the the Great Lakes you know Great uh Lake Ontario is right near here uh-huh plus we're in what's called the Finger Lake Region of New York where there're lots of small lakes everywhere and these are uh real good um for like you know bass fishing and so forth they have mostly small mouth in them or no we have a quite actually quite a lot of variety here's uh there's we have large mouth small mouth um sort of musky pike stuff like that um-hum you know all sorts of fun stuff like that um we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on Lake Ontario every year oh yeah that's right uh-huh so it's it's that's a lot of fun um-hum how about you do you like what what do you like to go for oh it's it's uh i fish for bass but i hardly ever catch one but um um they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon and uh you know they wash when they open up the dam and let out water they wash down the fish and uh you catch that white bass and crappie out of there yeah um every once in a while there'll be striped bass we have uh some friends who live on a lake and it the lake it just seems is is completely filled with bass to the point where you know normally you go you you go fishing for bass you get a lot of sunfish or um-hum or cat or whatever and some other strange stuff but in this particular lake we went out with some friends once and we just every time you tossed the line in you pull up a five six seven inch minimum bass and usually you pull up you know thirteen to fourteen inch bass wow yeah it's a real it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just we pull up you know bass after bass and um-hum during perch season as well you pull up a lot of uh probably during during perch season the perch will run in very large schools so what they'll do is just you'll you'll be sort of boating around these people own a little row boat and they'll be boating around and they'll hit a they'll hit a school of perches in the middle um-hum and when they do you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at they they just drop it in they they can't pull it in fast enough what do you what do you catch perch on um i they actually they according to them you can catch when the perch are running you can catch them on just about anything huh they tend to use i guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes but you know i've she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything you know um-hum they'll corn or salami or bread or anything they'll they'll they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded these large schools yeah it's sometimes i use corn but uh uh some fish steal it off the hook sometimes yeah it's a big problem yeah um the other day i was fishing with bread uh there's a college across the street and they it's it's full of carp yeah and uh i caught a carp on a about what size is that uh i think it was a number two treble hook and it's huge its its mouth was just full of hooks um wow so he was in a bad way but uh it's he was fast a big one he's uh yeah well it's uh it was sixteen inches long wow that's that's that's a nice size carp yeah i think it was about a pound and a half you know but all they're good for is the fight boy they don't they really don't want to come out of the water they they zip through the water you know you're how your line goes you know uh-huh and i thought you know that uh i wasn't going to be able to get it in because uh the one i hooked just about ten minutes before when when i tried to raise it out of the water it fell off so it wasn't hooked very well but you know i got it that far i figured that uh that that that counts yeah that's what i said that's what i told the guy the guy was standing there and he laughed when it fell off and i said that's a quick release right there do you do you do you actually like the taste of fish do you like eat the fish that you catch or are you more of a sport fisherman um catfish yeah but uh i haven't eaten anything else you know um um there's some uh my dad has a farm and there's he has two ponds up there and my uncle has a a pond upstream and there's a lot of crappie in there now but uh i think he's the only one that's that's caught enough crappie or a big enough crappie to eat but the catfish there's you know there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and right so you can just yeah yeah oh because i don't actually like fish it's sort of so when i fish it's more for sport than anything else yeah and if you know when you when you have to look in their eyes and you know hit them in the head or whatever that's what you do with a catfish you know because you have to sever their spinal cord right and and and and and be careful you don't get stung yeah yeah yeah i know it have you ever tried uh deep sea fishing uh not yet my brother went off the coast of Maine uh when the i don't know what they Mackerel that school out there it's he he said that it was just like that they were throwing like uh uh hell benders or uh yeah uh some other kind of treble hook lure and and uh each time they bring them in they'd have at least one sometimes they've had two on you know one on every hook yeah we i was out in Florida with a friend a while ago and we would go and just uh drop two you know a a two or three rig two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat we just dropped it down there and the captain had you know some kind of sonar in the boat so he'd maneuver us in into a school of fish and you just drop it in and um-hum and it just you you get one or two at a shot you know and yeah it's a good deal too it was it was a like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat wow you know and and and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want yeah down here it's like two hundred dollars a day well this is yeah this this this was for a you know large there were a group party maybe thirty of us on the boat we we weren't all related just you know thirty people off the shop in the boat there if you want to go on a boat alone it's like two hundred dollars a day yeah yeah but this is great because it was i think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something um-hum you know so you'd get to go out there for five for for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and and fish all day it's really nice it's real enjoyable yeah well i i don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not i think we're probably close though yeah it's nice talking to you nice talking to you too good luck with fishing this season good luck bye-bye bye-bye  okay cars you you maybe this is a fantasy we can to talk about any kind of car we want here i want a Rolls Royce and a Cadillac hey that sounds like a great deal to me you have great aspirations well let's see i we just bought uh a seventy three Mercedes that we have restored oh that's great your husband uh i'm i'm a hobbyist too i like to work on cars too and it yeah it has really been a lot of fun uh we found some guys that actually you know worked for a Mercedes dealership and uh they also repair them for other the people on their off time oh that's good so have we we have redone that thing from stem to stern i mean inside outside you know we've redone the body repainted it detailed it so you know i really haven't thought much past that it seems like you know i don't know if i'll ever want another new car again you know was you why they they didn't say buy it they didn't necessarily say buy it new they just said what would you buy you know maybe not yeah that's true i i don't know it just seems like uh you know for what we've put into it i feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more than you know yeah yeah yeah oh sure a restored vehicle is is great i think certainly if it's an old Mercedes will be good yeah right we the one thing that uh we did decide as it's it's we wanted it to be as authentic as possible but we did break down and put a CD player in it that's not quite authentic but at any rate that that was one thing that i one of the features that i did want well that's great i'd passed up on one and put a sunroof in it i had to stop there oh yeah you all you all done a lot more when i talk about working on cars i sure don't do that yeah well of course we do it ourselves but like i said we were just lucky to find these guys that do it you know they're they just weren't really expensive and oh okay okay oh that is good to have uh knowledgeable people and uh yeah you know right and they work on it so the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and and work on it or work on it so that's amazing yeah it's you know it's really it's really been nice we uh i i do all my own work uh so i i have Chevies mostly well that's all i've got right now i've got three Chevy V Eights i'm uh i'm uh a Chevy i'm an American car person but i do like Mercedes uh-huh uh-huh yeah you're an American car person yeah yeah i i have always had an American American car and uh i had a real real bad experience with the Cougar that i had it was an eighty two Cougar yeah and uh i don't know i think it just soured me on it for some reason because i had trouble with it starting the engine blew up in it i had to replace the engine when it was only two years old so yeah you know i i thought what the heck you know we'll try something different so well i'm not a Ford person and never have been as a kid and uh i do like the V Eight engines and i think the the yeah i went to the auto show with my daughter hear recently down in Dallas and i to me the American cars are far superior to the Japanese in styling engines right now i mean i'm not saying that they were a couple of years ago uh-huh uh-huh really yeah right yeah yeah i would that that there's i see a marked improvement you know you know as far as uh what i've heard about performance and such oh yeah you know so uh uh hopefully it'll stay that way i mean you know i'd i'd i would hate to see the American car industry suffering more than it already has oh yeah you know even though right now i'm not driving an American car but uh i think i uh you know they said they said what do we want to buy i i'm uh seriously not seriously thinking but i i would like to put it in that category uh buy a Cadillac but i wouldn't buy a new one and you know of course if i had the money i'd be happy to by a new one but uh uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah yeah i do look for a one year old vehicle you know with twenty some odd miles or whatever twenty thousand miles whatever uh-huh yeah twenty thousand yeah yeah well that's what my parents are avid Cadillac freaks they had uh and i think my my mother drives the SeVille now that's uh i guess it's a couple of years old and uh she had a SeVille before that that had the odd backs that was sort of oh yeah i remember those yeah yeah yeah and she it final just wore out they had they had purchased it i don't can't remember how many years they had that car but she loved the styling of it that she may want to save if she she doesn't have it anymore no she sold it and she that since they don't make them anymore she that could be turned into a classic in in ten fifteen years yeah i know yeah she kept telling herself that and it's sort of a bone of contention between she and my dad because my dad said well just let me take it down there and find out what's wrong with it i mean he came back with a new car yeah i think he had an ulterior motive he could just see you know dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went but uh no he wanted new one yeah right yeah they they really are nice cars there there i i'm still a full size person and i like a full size Cadillac i i want one of those i think they are i don't know a classic but they're certainly not they haven't changed in about uh twenty years and yeah uh-huh yeah yeah and they'll eventually phase them out uh and i sure would like one ever those uh uh within the next five years or so yeah it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again you know they had right they've scaled everything down so much and uh i have i don't i've never owned a really large car i don't know i think that Cougar was the biggest thing i ever had and well even the Japanese cars are bigger too but uh i've never had a Japanese yeah yeah now the Lexus are very nice looking cars you know i've never had a Japanese car i i've had friends who had them uh-huh and i think they're a lot over rate and their's no styling to them that you can't tell one Japanese car from the other they all look alike you know i don't mean that as a joke i mean they really all look alike and the adds i don't have any idea what which car it is that's true that's true yeah yeah what is what yeah uh-huh uh-huh until i look at it to see what it is and i think they have not uh lead the field in styling they do have nice sports cars yeah but the price is way more you can get a Cadillac for the same price as you can get a small Japanese car it's ridiculous now uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah i know that uh i've i've sort of always felt like with Buicks it seems like all Buicks to me look alike you know i guess it just uh there seems to me they're all the same shape i have a very good friend that um-hum has a Buick Regal and she she's had she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it and that's what she's going to buy again and i'm like oh please it looks exactly the same as this old one that you've got and so i guess it's in the eyes of the beholder i suppose yeah oh yeah yeah well if if you're interested you to go to the next auto show i i look at the Cadillacs and boy there were some Cadillacs that i didn't even realize they made but they were just styled so differently really uh-huh uh-huh they were standard Cadillacs but they really looked beautiful are they still are what they're what they have out for like the next year is everything still pretty square it seems like the Cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really i i can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the oh no they have they have convertibles now in the Cadillac field and they have that new uh it's not the big uh Fleetwood the one i want which is the same in the last twenty years yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah there's another one that has came out in the last few year it's not the Seville the Seville is totally different no the auto show they had fantastic looking cars so uh uh-huh now when when was this when this was this recently oh yeah it was a month or so ago oh okay because i have a well they have it every year yeah usually when i see the new cars it's during the fair when i go to the auto building at the State Fair and that's usually when i see anything you know right now this was uh in it was downtown in the uh Convention Center they had all the cars they had certainly had Japanese and German cars they had the full range and they had some they had some new cars that weren't even out they had a uh oh i see yeah new Chevy Suburban truck you know that big big one that was uh they didn't have a price on it nor did they know had a it would cost it had a microwave in it and everything it was they had several futuristic cars oh really uh-huh oh my word that's wild you know you you hear about things like that and you think that can't possibly be done i mean it just that's just too weird yeah i know and i like engines they had a lot of broken down engine not broken down i mean you know cut uh displayed engines you know uh-huh right uh-huh so you could tell the what see the inside of them or whatever yeah oh yeah but uh that that sold me in buying a new car you know i mean certainly interested in buying a new car but again the yeah the American cars were for superior in styling and new engines yeah yeah hum well maybe somebody's finally woken up you know and uh i think so because they've been making these four cylinder and six cylinder engines for a while and i think that i i would definitely buy again there's the question are we in the market uh yeah yeah and i could buy anything you know oh yeah you know i could fine i i was really crazy about Jags for a while and the convertible what is it XJS or something like that and i you know thought that's a dream car and and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant you know i yeah yeah well i work on them myself so i don't that you know my cars don't go to the shop you know so uh i am a mechanical engineer and i've always done it myself and uh yeah yeah well that's good that you can i've got three of them and uh i can't remember one i think i had one someone welded a muffler on for me in a years time i think that's the only thing of the three vehicles that i've in it just the welding on like i said i don't do that you know oh really that oh gosh that's great i think it takes a talent to do that you know my my husband is uh engineer but he cannot i mean i or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it that's might be part of it but uh you know we just i just say forget it we'll just take it in and have it taken care of he drives drives a Honda yeah i i noticed that when i was a kid uh i was wasn't a mechanical engineer but i worked my way through college as a mechanic so i learned early from fifteen on uh-huh right yeah and dropped it for a long time when after i got out of college and then picked it up again later on and now again i've got three vehicles and i i don't i never and they just don't go to the shop at all you know um-hum yeah well that's to that's one thing that when you would consider see when i go out to think about a new car or buy another car i don't think about well is this engine that i can work on or that you know my husband can work on or whatever uh-huh you know so you're you're pretty lucky in that respect that yeah i'm keeping V eight V eight Chevy engines because that's what i know and in fact i stock the same part i'm like a little stock if you brought your Chevy to me i could i'd probably have some parts for it right now you knows yeah that's what you know yeah um-hum that's pretty good it's really been funny because we have like been you are own contractors kind of with this car and when i say we have redone everything i mean we have redone everything and it's oh that's great i've always wanted to that too it's really been so interesting the people you meet because uh my husband Carl has called all over the country you know he's gotten these catalogs trying it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts than you might think this is for a seventy three oh i can imagine  all right uh how long have they been recycling there in Virginia um actually quite a a a while um i've lived here for six years and can you hold on just a second yeah um-hum hello uh-huh oh i'm sorry i must have got the other line cut off um so they've been doing that it for a while now uh-huh and um it i live in an apartment uh-huh and my apartment facilities there it is hold on oh have some problem with the phone huh hello okay sorry about that yeah okay you're okay yeah um okay um anyhow they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only um i've been recycling for maybe about two years now and at another another another public facility where they have you know recycling of glass um aluminum and paper uh-huh uh-huh have you have you cycled plastic recycled plastic also now no and that's what i i don't understand exactly why they don't have that option we we have out here uh up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way they had some bends around that we could find and put them in but uh-huh um-hum not all that many it wasn't very well advertised but recently uh the refuse department has has uh is working on getting a system going where we will actually have uh uh-huh a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things um-hum so it it should be good uh i think it's a marvelous idea when you think of uh when i just think of the papers that i dump out uh-huh uh-huh i mean there just it's such a i waste i just hate to think about it yeah now an additional thing is um where i work uh-huh they also have recycling there of um all white paper and of you know cans also uh-huh uh so because i mean a lot of people you know right at the vending machines they have receptacles uh that you know you can just pop your cans in and near the Xerox machines they have places you know for your paper you know i keep a uh little box at my desk uh-huh yeah uh-huh uh-huh you know and i just throw as i'm using the white paper you know i just throw it right in there and then you know they have someone that comes around and pick it up you know every afternoon yeah yeah all that's neat which you know is an excellent idea at work because i know the amount paper they go through there because yeah yeah that's right i guess one of the things i think that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about uh-huh about it there's needs to be more public uh service of programs or something that would let us know had a happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening yeah i would agree with that uh-huh um-hum right and there's i've seen a few things but not very much really and i i think that's a shame they need to uh do a little more i'd like to know for instance when i when they say uh plastic um-hum all plastic what kind of plastic can you put all together or is there some reason not to uh now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use i don't know exactly uh-huh um-hum but i i'd be glad to organize it if that they'd tell me what it is i'm doing um-hum right because that would that would be really helpful um-hum yeah yeah i agree with you there another thing that i like here which is i do with i have to actually go to two different recycling areas because uh one of them is that um their aluminum cans is for um Children's Hospital for a burn fund oh uh-huh so all the monies are donated you know for the recycling to Children's Hospital which i think is an excellent idea there you know because the other public yeah um-hum that's great now that gives you a little bit of incentive there uh-hum right right and before even at work before they started the recycling plan which at work they've only been doing since January first of this year i had had everyone in my department recycling and you know i would have them drop swing them for you huh right drop their cans off in my office and then i would haul them you know here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund uh-huh which got people really going into it but i think that's right i think i think helping us be more enthusiastic enthusiastic about it helping us maybe maybe using the money for something special that would be um-hum like paying off the national debt uh-huh that there there you go making sure that's for sure but i i think that's right i think they there needs to be a little bit more in the area of of uh advertisement advertisement and letting public letting you understand more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how you're it's done and what what happens to it because i think that's that would help a lot um-hum um-hum right right um-hum and i'm sure you know in the near future i would think they would be coming out with more you know i've seen a definite trend you know towards more recycling everywhere you know even at McDonald's yeah yeah i yeah you know with their their use of no foam containers anymore yes i i i'm glad to see some of these things i think right i think i think it is getting more you know advertisement people are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do and that we need to right somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped and all these things that i think that's true uh-huh right well i think i'm that's about my uh some on recycling but i i enjoyed talking to you yeah okay well i did too uh-huh all right bye now okay bye-bye  do you have any pets now oh i sure do i have a cat and a dog named Joey Joey the the dog is Joey uh-huh he's the little boy Pomeranian the cat is oh my goodness and we just got a new addition to the family so to speak we also have a fish oh my it's a mud dog i beg your pardon it's a mud dog it's uh oh a cross between a catfish and uh i don't know what a salamander well did you all catch it or uh uh-huh we have a cat Stripper uh-huh oh the mud dog no did no did you catch the fish uh we had a friend give it to us uh-huh and it's all alone in that aquarium yeah we'd like to get him a friend but um uh we haven't found one yet so how about you do you have any pets well at the present time i have two dogs oh really what kind an English setter you know that's the white dog with the feathers and it has uh yellow spots on it uh-huh which they call i think uh liver spots uh-huh and that's a male and i have a wonderful female lab black lab uh-huh how long have you had them quite a long time uh probably five or six years and unfortunately the black lab that's a female it that it's it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had an i when she was about three years old we noticed that she was having problems uh problems limping and so forth and uh-huh she has hip dysplasia oh no and it's in that breed uh-huh but now i think there are tests that can be conducted uh to tell whether or not the puppies have the have it uh-huh but i think i don't know apparently they've been so in well i don't know inbred or what but oh is that right well no i'm not sure that's the situation but it um for those dogs that are registered and if if you should have one uh that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it uh huh i had no idea i hadn't didn't even know that uh-huh but she's wonderful um our dog Joey has uh a back problem um like have uh he he's got a bad back but he's seven uh i guess he's about almost eight years old what are the what are the symptoms um he just uh he doesn't he uh you he rolls over he doesn't like to roll over uh-huh um even you just when you touch him a certain way on the back yes but otherwise he can jump uh you know just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way um well uh i have had just wonderful luck with this lab uh when i uh let's see winter before last we would bring her in and uh when it was cold uh-huh and she wouldn't i you know the next morning you want to take them out and she wouldn't i couldn't get her up without picking picking her up and which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds i bet um until if i allowed her to not get up on her own it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon uh-huh anyway i uh met my son's uh college roommate is a vet uh-huh and he said um let's give her some race horse shots and you know in i'm i'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this but you because you all the time you know run into people with problems oh yeah anyway that's when we lived in Oklahoma and uh so he gave this dog a series of it's they give it to race horses uh to get rid of uh cartilage uh-huh and it's called anyway it's a series of six shots once a week and then i noticed after two shots she was do you have to give those well i could have but i can't give a shot oh i believe me i understand i took her from Enid Oklahoma to Oklahoma City every week for six weeks uh and uh after the the second shot she was significantly better then i didn't notice any improvement till the after the sixth one uh-huh and ever since and he said uh a booster uh every year or two uh-huh i mean maybe every six months or or something like that and when i notice in the winter when it's worse you know it's cold weather and so forth then i have uh gotten a booster for her but not many people in this part of the country know anything about um i've had to get it from Oklahoma they've heard about it but they've really never used it uh-huh yeah i've never heard anything about it either so dogs that get down in the hips like i think German Shepherds do it and probably large dogs uh-huh and uh it's just wonderful does he get is he an inside dog also or does he just run out in the backyard is he fenced in uh um um well we're living now in an area where we we we're in the woods and we take walks i just don't let them oh yeah uh uh go away from me but we take walks through the woods twice a day uh-huh uh-huh oh that's nice and uh i can over do it on her oh yeah but anyway at least she can go and she's not limping along and all that uh-huh tell me about your cat oh Stripper well he started out being a little orphan and we we took him in and uh he's about two years old now and he loves his treats uh both uh Joey and uh Stripper get treats and uh let's see and is um Stripper an inside cat or outside o h well he's outside and uh uh-huh he's got a way to get in he's got free access of a window we like to keep open yes so he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to well of course that's nice they they Joey on the other hand is a little different he has to go out whenever uh we ask him and when he when we ask him he uh he barks he'll either bark for food or he'll bark to go out and he'll tell you which one he wants well he's been he's been through obedience school well he has been trained and you've keep you've kept up it up haven't you oh definitely yeah it is wonderful i i have some neighbors across the field and um they when we first moved here uh when the dogs and i didn't feed we have a very nice kennel and everything but but since i i didn't want to i was i just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while uh-huh so i kept watch and never let them get away but now every couple weeks they would one would slip away and my neighbor said to me oh i noticed those dogs dogs are so well trained anytime they hear your voice they come so that made me very proud oh yeah well have we been talking five minutes i'm not for sure i'm not either but i think maybe we have but yeah well um so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure oh definitely have you ever done this before yes oh okay um i haven't ever called i've put in the paper work i just never made the call oh really uh-huh yeah so i didn't know if they stop you when the time is up or no they don't no i i glanced at the clock when um we started and i think it's been probably about five and a half minutes or something but one day i was talking to a lady about gardening and i'm i love gardening and she did too an and after uh-huh after about twelve minutes or something the recording came on and said that was the end of the tape oh well at least you know you did your part uh-huh but it's been so much fun too uh talk how did you get into this well my best friend in Virginia's daughter is a part of this project in Texas oh i see and so she knew that i had the time and would be would enjoy it uh-huh that's true um i mean i so but i have a hard time getting anybody because i guess do you work um yes i do yeah and probably just got home uh-huh so um during the day i mean i think and i understand also they want men right i was going to tell you the same thing they're really looking for a lot more men to participate yeah my husband does does he yeah i need to i've got some applications i need to hand them out but uh this is a great project that they're working on and it's really going to lead the way uh for a lot of economics um applications and and yes development in the voice area yes when i think so too and i haven't helped them out on the men on men particularly but my husband had been made in fact he's been probably has made a few more calls than i have because i tend to not make them around dinner time i try to uh-huh you know make them do during the day but nobody's home well this is the perfect time for me well maybe i'll get you next time well good yeah it so fun much fun to talk to you all right have a good one you too bye bye  and how long have you lived there i've lived in this area for about twenty six years okay well you're familiar then very well with what's going on there yes i am we just moved to North Carolina from Oklahoma and i'm not yet familiar we're out in the country a little bit uh-huh uh-huh so it's a contract garbage pickup and it's all thrown together in this area they don't have that oh well let me tell you what we have good i live in a very progressive county and uh it has we have for the last uh year i suppose had um newspaper pickup but there's always been you know scout troops and that sort of thing interested in doing that because it they get earn a little money and also you know they were helping the environment but the um uh-huh the county government then got involved and decided to uh mandate newspaper collection and although they're still we still give ours to the girl scout troop at our church uh they do have curbside pickup in over the entire county for newspapers good uh-huh uh and then in addition to that they excuse me do you have to bundle it or uh we we can put it in paper bags that's that makes it okay that's that makes it okay um they used to only recycle let you do it uh tied with string okay yeah right but now they do it in paper bags and they do say that it is paying for itself now in the actual municipality of Rockville we moved just outside of it five years ago uh they've been doing newspaper recycling even longer and they were they had their regular um garbage or you know the the social people pick it up on a separate day and they said that was paying for itself It was paying the extra salaries for those people as well as paying you know the city for doing it uh-huh well good but the whole county now and it's a large county this is Montgomery County right outside Washington DC um is has begun a program to over a period of the next year to um uh-huh have all well not all waste but um plastics um aluminum and other tin cans and uh glass of all colors um and it's they they will you will they will also be picked up at the curb and it can be put together at one point and we've been doing it in my family for a while by at first at first we were doing it um separating it because most of the facilities that would take it were uh yes required it yes required it's being separated but they've got this wonderful new facility now that separates it and they had a drawing of it a diagram of it in in one of the local papers and it works um it's like conveyor belts and some of it works by gravity and of course you can imagine the aluminum because it's very light weight um you know falls in one place and the glass goes another place and other and tin that would be picked up by metal is just picked up you know some other way right uh-huh um and then the plastic um you know go because it just kind of doesn't fall i mean i guess it keeps going on the conveyor belt or something i can't remember the the design right now but it's wonderful because you don't have to separate uh-huh that is nice and i've read articles here uh about the confusion involved in what is to be put out and what isn't and the problems that uh some of the recycling centers are having because of the slick magazine pages in with the newspaper which they say ruins the whole batch and uh yeah the unacceptable plastics in with the plastics which ruins the whole batch and i just wondered well they do try to control that by giving a little instruction uh-huh they do try to say you you know you should have it certain way but um on the the slick newspaper print that comes in with like the Sunday papers and so on they haven't really protested magazines shouldn't be as a rule should not be put in but there are always a few of those pages and they must have a better way to do it now because they they haven't gotten too upset about that right uh-huh in general as long as it's the newspaper because there's not you know volume wise maybe it does have to be you know significant volume um percentage before it's a serious problem in the plastics um the the county recycling where we take ours now because we don't yet have the curbside pickup um i the the transfer the you know just solid waste transfer station they uh have indicated they only want the two liter plastic soda bottles and or i guess any soda bottles that are plastic uh caps removed and uh milk cartons uh-huh um but in fact there is another facility that will take other items the the you know there are little codes on the bottoms of these things uh for plastic and they look it's a triangle uh-huh with arrows uh and that indicates it can be recycled but there are different grades of plastic and that's probably what you're talking about sometimes some of those plastics cannot be reused in certain ways right uh-huh some can now even our grocery stores here we have two different large chains that of the plastic bags but you see i'm i have a problem with that i'll take them occasionally but i've decided recollecting the the plastic bags yeah we that i'll take them occasionally but i've decided that i will only take use paper which we are we do get a choice because i know that's biodegradable plastic isn't they can reuse it but it's really not biodegradable right uh-huh right right right well we've had we've been collecting papers here and we uh as new residents we don't have affiliation with uh scout troops and and all that so yeah yeah we had a difficult time finding in Charlotte uh a place to finally put them which surprised me and i thought they would be huh yes i am surprised yeah uh located throughout the city and we've called and finally found one fifteen miles away oh not very convenient then no well what part do you actually live in Charlotte proper no right outside north of uh of Charlotte near the university because my sister lives in Matthews which i think is a little south of Charlotte is south and and east yes right yeah well actually it's called Charlotte now they used to be called Matthews where she lives they incorporated it but um i i was thinking that you know i i don't know what she does with hers either uh-huh well how active how active are the schools there i'm i'm an old person Linda grew up uh during World War Two and we saved papers and tin foil and string and everything else and uh did it through the school systems and i've wondered uh-huh well it's it's not taken on there as well although the young people i work in the school system so if they're really active i teach in in the high school um the uh we have an environmental club which has just begun at our high school this year and i think maybe the young people are becoming more conscious of the need uh-huh um of course it's going to get down to if it's not made easy as i just described the way they're going to do it in this county uh they're making it so easy that you almost can't miss uh-huh uh doing it but because you don't have to separate and all that but that seems to be the only way that it'll ever really take off is if it's not too complicated because people in general are just lazy and uh-huh in the schools they are trying to make students more conscious and uh but i think the adults are the ones that have to lead the way and they have required the the students in the cafeterias to recycle but of course you know that it doesn't go all the way they they make the effort they try but i think as the younger children come on maybe they'll be a little more conscious of it and eventually that that was sort of my point too in addition to being a a good focal or central collection point it does raise the awareness if you do it through the school system and yes yes it does uh we because they they recycle the styrofoam because that's what most of the uh you know the little trays that they have their dinner you know we used to use those heavy uh plastic or whatever they were metal even trays in in the cafeterias in our schools but but now they have these right plastic these Styrofoam ones like they get at McDonald's kind of and um and those are being uh-huh probably one of the worst things we ever done to ourselves isn't it awful now but do you know that um McDonald's is doing uh-huh right um McDonald's is phasing them out and uh they're supposedly going to try to recycle those that are still left we're talking about oh yeah two jillion i'm sure so eventful it will take a time but um i i just worry about what's going to happen to the next generation um uh no uh how do you feel about the high schools that you you teach do you feel that they have the right i i get mixed emotions when i see a bunch of uh youngsters throwing things out of the car versus well many of them do they they're talking about environment i know oh but yeah exactly that does seem a little bizarre um i i find that right there is a percentage of of uh the student body uh that is a a aware active and interested there is uh a much larger percentage still that it hasn't quite you know taken yet um but i think they're becoming more aware i think what will make the change is um enough of those who are aware and making an effort to do something about it those are going to have to ridicule those are going to have to ridicule peer pressure or something right peer pressure is a big one yeah uh-huh yeah yeah to to kind of make the effort um well i yes i am too i am too well Linda i enjoyed talking to you but i i'm hopeful well i enjoyed talking to you and i wish i wish you luck there in Charlotte thank you uh bye bye-bye  okay there's there's one um i'm at living in Texas where you at i'm in Rome New York in where Rome New York Rome New York okay well Texas let me look at my husband and ask him does Texas have state capital punishment Rome New York yeah yes they do he's reminding me of where i live yeah yeah i i new New York does not but uh uh-huh they're they're trying to reinstate it and the governor's opposed to it being that uh Democrat that he is uh Mario Cuomo uh-huh yes but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it yeah i um i ethically don't like the idea but or i should say morally i don't like the idea but um social ethics ethics and ethics socially and ethically i think it's a good idea i'd i would agree with that they almost even more in certain crimes i don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically but i'm really offended by the thought that i have to support uh just the existence of you know murder rapist whatever you know uh-huh uh-huh right and any demand on the street no i know right that that uh after they've gone and done horrible things molested children and kill them and whatever that society has to pay uh upwards uh thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them uh-huh yeah and Texas is having a problem right now and it's the the the the the repeatable crime i think that's the the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're they're patrol the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done oh heinous things from calling from uh killing police officers to i mean just multiple you know molestations molestations to murders of children just you know really bad things and they're get these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered right and and now they can't find them and they're finding bodies in ditches you know i mean you think think why they say it's because you're over crowded it's over crowded then you think how can every is everybody that stupid or is the world really that rotten i i don't know it's a hard question you look at the United States we have the largest murder rate of any developed uh or uh right i know and then and i don't know how Americans are about handguns but uh yesterday a lady i work with just told me today that uh in the state capitol here in Austin Texas they had been uh looking at a bill uh making it easier to accept the bill to access to access handguns and they passed it which basically means without an FBI check any person in this state over twenty one can get a gun here in New York it's a lot harder than that uh it takes uh it takes almost six months to get uh handgun permit in this state is it that's good say that good i think that's like the state of Virginia yeah that's great now the the and that's with uh you have to have uh oh a police investigation you have to have references and i know because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference um uh-huh uh-huh and i know it there is it's very easy to get uh uh you know there's no no restrictions whatsoever on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that which aren't uh-huh the the i i don't consider to be the kind of a a crime uh weapon you know uh so right they're not the cattiness behind right yeah i mean i don't like guns in general but when i think about uh this topic like capital punishment i look at somebody i mean i just remember when i was in college in a dorm and i think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him but in Florida in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case right and how they just executed well it hasn't been just but it was in the i think the second or third quarter of last year nineteen ninety right and i had you know i knew some people that said why are you glad you did you know this had nothing and i said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that but i actually i mean there should be more cases like that where they flip a switch i have and i might be too cold too but they flip a switch i don't know i mean yeah i well and and the thing with Bundy was though he escaped and then so many times yeah and uh did it again and uh yeah yeah i mean and that's just maybe because of the little more that they said celebrated that uh he's not the only one you know you you see somebody's mini series and you hear about somebody's crime there was something on and this gets back to capital punishment no but the man had stolen uh not stolen but kidnapped uh some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida and they changed all the facts that they said it was true and they buried her alive uh-huh oh God and Peter Strauss had played the lead role and the man and and the at the end of you know how they have these mini dramas at the end they said this set person was paroled like six months ago and you're thinking oh that's nice great i mean you know i'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence but it does serve as a punishment uh definite punishment you know lasting punishment that sure there's an end to the the situation right in that particular instance um but i but i don't but i know it's not a end all and be all that's the problem i have with it in Texas they think it's an end all and be all they think that if they electrocute or slip or do something else gas somebody right um that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime ridden and we just moved here uh we've been here before lived in Minneapolis Saint Paul uh-huh uh which has an exceedingly low crime rate and then we were transferred back here and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were you really begin to see uh just how problematic just living is even suburban no matter where you are and how you're in Rome New York is that and and is that like near Albany or Syracuse right Rome New York it's up state it it's uh near Syracuse it's about uh well i i actually live in a Village of Sylvan Beach i work in Rome um what what type of area is that is that uh in term it's more rural uh it use to be use to be a uh uh-huh uh have a lot of heavy industry but it's kind of uh all the industry has gone south and uh now the Air Force is the largest employer in the uh area and uh uh-huh sure uh so it's how would how is the situation in there in terms of crime and things that would not too bad not too bad it you know you the still have the um more drug problems and typical uh small city type problems but i don't know that there's a real yeah uh-huh uh no there isn't the harsh crime and all not the harsh criminality that you find in yeah now Dallas is a i'm being very sarcastic it's just a great place um on some days uh it's um i don't know the good ole boy network here is uh very strange like i said they believe that if they kill somebody you know tit for tat and deed for deed that that does something uh but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that i mean they really are over crowded i mean that's that's just not a cop out uh-huh right um and i just you know i'm originally from Pennsylvania which i think is basically like New York these days i'm not sure if they i don't think they have capital punishment there think think Pennsylvania Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it because i'm from uh from Pennsylvania also uh-huh just uh just outside of Philadelphia i'm not trying yeah and i'm from Pittsburgh so oh well we'll forgive each other yeah um because they use to be very very conservative when i was growing up i and i can't i haven't lived there in twenty years but um right the west part of the state is and then the east part of the state is got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases so there you go i don't know that's a different topic subject altogether but uh right i don't know i think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime i think everyone would you and i think are probably honest and candid because we could do it on in this vehicle um but i think everybody if they were touched by it would say right if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out which i think every human does i think they'd say yeah do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me you know um sure yeah if your friends or family get uh had that happen to them i think everyone would uh i they'd probably uh-huh pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face as they did it yeah i just don't think that uh you can rehabilitate i mean i just don't uh oh i did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class and i just the subject i remember we drew things out of a hat and it was something uh just it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment and when you see how many repeat offenders there are uh check check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and um rape rapist getting their hand just slapped yeah you know and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session you know all these uh intangible intangible intangible things and you're thinking right you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal either right because you wouldn't know what you're getting um right but i don't know methods of capital punishment i have no opinions on that either i just well uh i uh yeah i don't know i think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless because i guess it's a pretty pretty rough thing to be uh electrocuted uh-huh is it uh how about the injection is that suppose to be oh yeah an injection yeah that would be even yeah i didn't even think about that yeah i'm not even sure in the split among the fifty states do you know which way it is the ratio it's more than aren't uh that it's more that don't have it isn't that correct i think yeah there's more that don't have it but amazingly it's like uh Massachusetts went back and reinstated capital punishment oh maybe six or seven years ago uh-huh i don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it but uh it's on the books which uh-huh yeah and always say do something about i'm not sure if Texas Minnesota i they didn't they didn't they were against well did they have it they were against it um Texas as i said has it but i haven't been back here long enough to to realize whether or not if they've done it in the last right  here we go okay where are you from i'm from uh Attleboro Massachusetts oh is that where you're talking from yes oh well yeah can tell from your accent how how about you i'm from Louisville Kentucky but i'm here in Texas oh you're down there in Texas oh okay um uh-huh so we're supposed to be talking about why only half the people vote in national elections huh um do you vote regular i vote regularly yes i do okay in the national elections um some of the local um i don't tend to unless there's a referendums something that's going to affect the town uh-huh uh then i uh well i then i put my two cents in uh i need to get into voting i've never voted you never ever voted no i've never voted i've never felt comfortable enough with it i don't know enough about politics to know what the right choice is anyway as far as uh even local candidates it just i talked about this the other day on the telephone with it's uh so many politicians you know they put up a front to me you know they're not showing you the real person anyway they're just show showing what the public wants to see uh that's true unless you unless you come from i come i come from a fairly small town so i i live in Rhode Island but i work in Massachusetts um uh-huh and it's fairly small and you and most of the people you tend to know at least the family or you know uh well that would be nice yeah it's uh it's getting away from that now i mean the town's growing bigger as as all towns are and you're right they're uh uh i think uh most politicians when they first get into politics they want to do a good job and then after they're they're in there a while you have to play the good old boy network right and it's uh uh um they have their own special interests and watch out for the people that are going to do the most for them too to get them reelected i think right well that's what i mean it's just you don't know what's real i guess yeah how about uh bond issues or referendum that they they put on you don't i don't know much about that at all what do you mean like when you vote for a certain thing not a person right yeah whether they they want to build a new school whether they want to put in a new reservoir or or okay no i've never voted on anything like that either um but yet they're taking your tax money or they would if if some of these bond issues passed uh-huh um you still didn't have any feelings one way or the other about whether they they should do it or shouldn't well see i've never how do you do the do you do that like you're voting just like if you're taking a a presidential election do you just go somewhere and place your ballot or yeah yes huh well see i've never heard of that well i know that sounds stupid but i really haven't i've never heard of that um how how long have you lived in in where are you now Texas in Dallas i'm no i'm in Denison Texas up north in on in the north part of Texas uh okay but you haven't lived your your whole life you came from Kentucky did you say right i moved from Kentucky when i was twenty one oh okay but you grew up in that town or right i grew up in Louisville well Louisville okay that's and but that's and Louisville's a a large city so yeah it's a fairly big city yeah you didn't have local real local politics like you know like a small town would how about where you are now is that a fairly large Denison it's uh i wouldn't say it's large but it is one of the bigger cities in this part of Texas yeah so you're in the same boat there right it's about the same and you don't really know who's who are what's going on or yeah no i remember once when i was working in Louisville one of the mayor candidates come up to the uh uh place where i was working and he had asked me i don't know i guess it had been about two years since i'd been eligible to vote and i haven't hadn't been voting well he had uh this is one of the things that you know formed my opinion on politician politicians he sat there and promised you know the next day we're going to take you up and get you registered to vote and you're going to vote for me and blah blah blah but then he never showed up ha you know yeah it was one of his aides or whatever but still i thought you know they say what they want to for the time being what sounds good just just so they can get in yeah that's all and it's uh they probably should limit the the terms of office to no more than two years i mean two terms that way they don't get in there because some of these guys have been in there like for twenty years and they they kind of run things the way they want to run them whether whether it's uh uh-huh for the good of the the town or the people in the town or not uh-huh well that's i think they need to have a a better oh i need to know a lot more about politics and they need to have something in the community well like in high school they should teach politics or the government i mean i think so yeah um some of them do now um social social sciences and i'm not sure how far they get into politics and that uh uh-huh well i want to know about politics in particular you know just you know what the workings of it is oh the like uh uh parliamentary procedure and and that sort of thing everything right in order for me to be able to form a a good opinion opinion on who to vote for or whatever i i need to know about it yeah you know uh and if i could keep a follow-up on the candidates running like right now you know i know whose president vice president and i know a couple of the mayors like Koch in New York i don't even know who's mayor down here in Texas off hand yeah yeah um i don't it it's they've got they've got rules and regulations they have to follow for for government procedures but there's too many special interest groups now that are in there that that can sway an election one way or another uh-huh um i don't even think running to to the running of the government now is done by the the president they say yo u know he's i think he's only really a figurehead he only can do certain amount of things because he's got so many people after him you know an he's he's got to look out so much well what do you think about i think just you know anybody should be allowed to run for president just even an ordinary guy off the street if he knows the politics well you can except it costs so much money now that the average person can't do that right it's it's that's what i mean it's all money and um plus they're all you you have to play the people that have been in power now uh most of them are i think are are crooks yeah and you have to play their ball game they've been in there so long and if you don't then they'll you know they'll find ways to get rid of you uh-huh no one's held accountable anymore for things that happen well what did you think of that whole mess with Ollie North and all that oh i think that they should have crucified him that's what i think uh Reagan and Bush and Reagan too Reagan he knew about it oh of course he did and if he didn't know the whole scope of it whoever whoever was directly under him he should have looked into it right or it should have been looked into more yeah an now it's coming out where there was there was holding the hostages now they're saying that the hostages were being made political pawns when Carter and Reagan were running i mean you know yeah well that's the way i felt when uh Carter and Reagan was running i liked Carter as a president he was a a a nice man i'm not sure uh he was too probably too moral yeah but he was a i don't know he was a good Christian and everything though well from what i've seen i was only sixteen then but i when Reagan came in i figured i thought it ran through my head that Carter lost because the hostages you know that whole mess yeah yeah wasn't it the day after Reagan was elected that they were brought home well shortly there after yeah or yeah shortly after yeah so there was some collusion in there i guess i think a lot of people were disappointed because they had been held hostage for so long and i think that's part of the problem why people don't vote anymore because of of it's just out of people's hands and they say one vote means a lot but but is a lot enough people it used to i don't think it one vote means means diddly anymore no but if enough people think like that then it does you know yeah but but people get disillusioned too well well if i knew more about it like i said if they would get some kind of educational program out there where just anybody can learn um probably one of the local do they have adult ed classes at some of the local schools oh i'm sure they do where they teach uh you know like political science or something i don't know i could check into that yeah because you because it might give you uh an insight you know uh you have to vote i've always i've always voted i even though sometimes it's hard to choose between whose running uh-huh right well wasn't it i know i can't remember i think i guess it was when Ferraro Ferraro is that her name when her and uh i can't remember who was running for president with her i just remember she was going to be vice um oh uh Ferraro yeah Geraldine yeah who was running with her who was her running mate uh i don't remember  well what are your did you like do you use credit cards uh not very often i usually uh the ones we use is like visa and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month huh-uh so it doesn't gets uh uh the credit uh i have uh uh right uh interest rate is so high that you're really if you're going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think don't you yeah otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly that's right uh it's not a very good idea do you have a lot of credit cards well i have a lot of them but i don't use them very much though right i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh tuition if it's you know if i'm short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can the other thing i i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off uh more than one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require oh yeah just goes on and on which is what they want yeah i think a lot of people go in debt because they think oh you know i can just charge it but really i mean if they don't have the money then they aren't going to have it in a month so yeah that's true they uh make the mistake of pushing all their cards there are times when it's when it's very useful like uh emergency trip yeah yeah or something sometimes when you when you the the money will be available but it's you know not immediately handy i think uh they're very helpful plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes right but uh i you really do need to be very um oh responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble yeah i made that mistake when i first got a job and that's kind of like it took me quite a while to pay them off uh-huh so after after that i decided well i'm not going to use them at all and just try to pay cash for everything and that worked for a while and then we got married so we decided to you know if we used them we would pay them off as we go so right right that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances the other thing about them is too if you really don't you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and haven't developed a credit thing it stops you from doing a lot of things if you if you pay for everything by cash uh there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or right that's true yeah a car so so they they have become a very vital part of our of our monetary system over the last few years uh-huh but uh it's true you have to be very careful or you end up uh going in the deep end and uh and an awful lot of people are in trouble um-hum we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card uh company that and he makes calls to people who have problems you know credit problems that are trying to work out of them and uh uh-huh poor thing he comes home very depressed every night oh because the world has so many problems of that sort so it's uh it's uh yeah it's a really big problem i think and um takes mature people to to treat it uh so that it's so that it's a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage right i think um the way the tax system was they encouraged people to use credit cards you know with a big write off at the end of the year yeah but now it's like it's punch money because right it doesn't do you any good now does it right you cannot right you cannot write off your interest even before it probably wasn't though because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it yeah you didn't get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying so well i'm not that uh other than that i don't have too much on credit cards but it's good to talk to you yeah you too thanks for calling bye uh-huh bye now  excuse me oh go ahead Ken so Ken how do you do your family budget well we don't actually have a budget budget per se what we do is uh sort of maintain a normal checkbook you know like everybody in the world does i guess and occasionally it actually balances and then um-hum um we also we um we have a a US Air Visa card and then every every dollar we every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage uh-huh oh yeah it's a real good deal actually if you charge a lot so what we what what my wife and i have taken to doing is charging everything in sight anything we buy we charge including groceries and so forth so what we'll do is uh-huh well then you just pay it off at the end of the month right we actually maintain a we have a savings a savings we have we we we have a checking account that we treat like a savings account scratch that we have a savings account that we treat like a checking account um-hum and so what we do is we anytime we do or make or charge something we write it out as if we wrote a check uh-huh and then at the end of the month all the money's there covered already so we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything oh that's a really good idea it keeps us hopping yeah see now i'd never get my wife to be able to follow that before we got married i had money in the bank i owned my own home i put in so much money each you know month towards long term savings you know like in uh mutual funds and things you know hm um-hum and uh after i got married no it just didn't work anymore uh she spends a lot she likes to spend on anything and everything with body lotion everything so we really haven't uh hm we don't have a good organized system yet maybe after awhile i'll rub off on her or something i don't think well you know you know what's you know what's always good is sort of a force savings where they just take money out of you're pay we did that for awhile where um yeah we actually still do it with with my wife's salary where we put it we have a separate a a a third account even um i mean a savings account in an in an entirely different bank where what we do is take um-hum yeah money out of her paycheck every week i'm a graduate student uh oh really in what field yes so am i yeah uh well uh in information systems i'm a voice researcher oh okay i'm in uh i i work in psycholinguistics actually uh-huh um but my wife's has a real job yeah and what she'll yeah so what we do is we take money out of her out of her paycheck each week yeah so does mine uh-huh and and put it it it goes directly into another account that we don't at at a at an entirely separate bank that we don't have access to so easily and it it goes there and it stays there and it builds up until we need it for something yeah see i think we might have to do that because she looks at what she brings home each week i it's going to be really hard for her to uh not have her own money um because like now you know i put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years and now she wants to go back to school but she saved enough maybe to get her through August right um-hum you know and that's it even and i keep saying now Laura you're going to have to save a little money i don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through it doesn't work Ken my mother always said don't argue about money so we don't oh right Jesus right that's the thing you you you don't argue about it uh but uh but you know uh there goes my savings but you know i it's one of those things it's oh God oh God yeah i i got lucky my wife apparently is is is not a she likes to spend but she's pretty good about things yeah now see my wife will do things like make clothes oh wow uh you know one of our one of our big investments that you know was i was wholeheartedly in favor of was to buy a sewing machine because she makes clothes and you know a descent sewing machine will really help her out and and she's already made you know presents and gifts and things for shorts for me and things for the summer you know so i guess i can't you know we've probably almost paid off the sewing with uh that's great with the money savings there yeah the savings from that so i can't complain too much you know she she's good about that and also we we dine at home a lot you know she likes to cook so that saves us from restaurants or whatever but that's good but she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like money money dumped down a drain you know right well i guess we all have those things though i mean i uh i uh i i go to uh i pay yeah what i think is a lot of money to go to a karate class you know for the you know i pay up through the year um-hum yeah but you need a hobby right exactly so you know that but that to her is sort of a waste but but she does her nails so yeah that's true yeah i know and those nails are so expensive i know oh gosh i was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her nails anymore i guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow exactly and then she waits for them to get their color back and then she'll polish them again i don't know whatever so she stopped for awhile boy what a difference they buy nail polish every two weeks it's uh gosh and lotion oh my goodness body lotion yeah yeah oh yeah we spend more on on soft body on on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things than uh she must spend more on one application of body lotion than i do on soap for an entire year and so yeah good old Ivory um well it it's for your benefit though right that's what yeah it's funny oh i think so she's always soft that's true always soft you know uh so so that's helpful yeah yeah yeah but i i think um i don't know maybe after uh we're not in school anymore we'll be much better at saving i think uh yeah i think that's uh now do you still own a house you said you owned one i sold my house and that's what's really paying for my uh time unemployed or whatever you know because the graduate assistantship really doesn't cover the ten thousand dollars in tuition really doesn't cover living expenses oh that's great right uh now well we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job so that makes it hard um with you know we're paying double rent and double utilities right oh wow and that makes it sort of expensive but see i live within my i live within my meniar menial very menial income and she doesn't she doesn't live within her her professional income you know so i just get a right there that'll kill you that's the killer two apartments and stuff like that yeah and and then even if we want to see each other on weekends it's twenty five thirty dollars in gas every weekend and that really adds up too you know so wow wow it uh it gets tough but i well that'll kill you yeah i think we'll do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone you know well it'll cut our telephone bills eventually right i mean you're not you know yeah by five by four fifths you know if if if she's here so it's it's actually tough this year but it'll be better in June she'll be move live together in June so hopefully our budget will in increase then right my God have you been married for long or no just since December oh wow so you guys really are newlyweds yeah yeah we're very newlyweds and but that's the you know we were together for probably um oh wow uh very close for about six months before we got married so you know we lived within uh though i owned held had my own house and things you know we still uh um-hum we're still pretty close and i knew her spending habits and and they're about the same they haven't changed at all you know my mother always said to me Tom now the best thing to do is be like you're father never say a word when you're wife spends money and i was like well that's true my dad never said a word you know yeah so yeah i actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes because i think you know um i sort i sort of feel guilty if you know given that she makes twice as much as i do yeah so i sort say you know if she wants to go out and buy something i never argue with her because she's she's real good at you know sort of saving and um yeah i don't i don't argue with her but i just get all i guess i i it must show on my face you know must be like like must be cringes or something you know um especially like yesterday or this past weekend we met half way between at uh at her parents house and um yeah she had on a new pair of jeans and she'd gotten all new underwear and i was like Laura how did you get all this stuff she goes well i just got paid and and i was like oh had the money in their pocket yeah yeah it was there it was burning it had to be spent you know but she said everything was on sale and i'm like oh oh that's good at least it was on sale that's good honey i'm glad you bought it on sale what else can you say that's right i do recommend the force savings bit the uh they take it out of your paycheck before you see it because then it doesn't hurt yeah i think yeah you don't notice it i think that's probably a really good idea you know you don't even think about it if it's gone you know so uh until you really need it and then all of a sudden you realize you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else um-hum yeah you know we managed do it that way yeah see i i was when i had when i was living alone and i had my own house and things uh you know i put one i was paid twice a month one paycheck went into savings and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage and the food bills and it and i was even able to you know to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account because i'm pretty thrifty and you know right but my wife likes to spend she enjoys so that's fine but uh for savings i'll have to look into that well yeah that's just that and that uh that has been our godsend you know we had some we've had some sort of major emergencies come up you know where um we also own our own house um we had an ice storm up here recently um-hum um-hum yeah yeah where it was it was pathetic i mean it was horrible i mean half the half the city owned trees or or or or half the one third of of of all the vegetation in this county is just wiped out oh really because of the heavy ice yeah it just it just weighed exactly it broke the limbs huh and our um we had to trim our backyard that had tremendous willow tree that it fortunately we didn't have to bring it down all the way but it cost us you know a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down i mean just to take off what was broken there plus we went and lived with friends you know this and that and and then the whole ice storm cost us still quite a bit of money even though insurance picked up some of it right yeah still not all of it they don't get you know and that plus and then we had a car expense like that same week one of the cars died you know um-hum all those things then they add up and that force savings really comes in handy then yeah yeah i can see that that's i keep trying to say to her you know Laura don't spend so much what happens if something happens to a car you know she's oh well it'll you well nothing'll happen ooh ooh i always just shut right  uh do you want to start do you have any ideas well the the the changes of course in the past past generation are the women in the work force that's for sure um and the while their positions salaries still aren't there yet the opportunities for women who are at least driven uh do do tend to be a little bit more compatible with uh changes in life style um um-hum so i suspect that that may have had more to do with uh changes in society than anything else is the number of the women in the work force um-hum yes and you know you said um along with salaries i also think that i think there's a little bit um that can be i don't know a little more development in the area of respect as well i don't know if women in higher positions are necessarily given the same respect as men um-hum um i think it depends on which positions and perhaps the personalities of the women yeah that's true um let's face it there there are men executives who have um uh gotten gotten there by uh rather um unsavory means uh you know trapping everybody up along the way um when uh uh they may not be necessarily liked but if when a woman does that she is ridiculed um-hum um-hum right uh to the n-th degree where as it's almost expected of men so some of that is stereotype i think right it's true like the uh the movie Working Girl did you ever see that um-hum i think i have although at the moment you i mean i know a little bit about it but oh um-hum well i think that sort of it was funny because it it sort of gave two very different types of women that both had very strong potentials and one had extremely aggressive and step on whoever you can yeah right way of getting to the top and the other one just worked hard and did you know her job and did it well and all that but um um-hum um-hum um-hum i think the educational opportunities have made some difference uh because at one point i know my mother-in-law used uh talked about when she went to college yeah she really sort of had to to do her own way because although she was one of three daughters um and while her parents were um very supportive in many ways they didn't really seem to have the um the the uh i don't know the understanding that that daughters should go on for a college degree uh had they been sons uh you know that would have been expected but for daughters it wasn't as necessary um and see i don't think that's so true anymore i think sure oh yeah exactly oh not at all people expect both daughters and sons to have whatever opportunities are available uh i know we have three sons and one daughter but the differences um-hum right and are are negligent in that area and in fact they they were in my own families as well um it was never considered that my sister and i wouldn't go to college uh you and you know certainly my brothers would but but we were included in that so i think those things do um-hum um-hum um-hum right well my mother i my parents are older because my siblings are all older i'm the youngest of older siblings and my mother um was um-hum had the uh had three sisters and one brother um so she had two sisters and one brother in any case um her she and her two sisters actually had to work and not go to school to put him through school uh-huh oh yeah and that i when i mean she she obviously at the time people didn't think twice about it you know that was just the way you did it but um and and and what was most important to them if they wanted to get a job was if they could type right right right right well you know that hasn't changed so much you know um take shorthand and um-hum well that's true that's the i know uh it's it it's always appalled me because i did not uh suffer that same problem fortunately uh because i went into biological research when i first got out of college um and so you know i was not in a in a situation where i would uh-huh oh asked to do typing uh but um i know that even now um many young women getting out of college right tend to find themselves in that position of of having to be uh sort of part of the secretarial pool it might not be called that but that boils down to what it is yes no it is it is until they work their way up and i don't think very many young men are ask to do that although perhaps they are asked to do somewhat uh less uh technical jobs or you you know too perhaps uh you know start working their way up but i don't think it's quite as um as low on the totem pole um-hum um-hum no exactly i know and you know just another whole thing i work at Manpower Temporary Services so i see i see the work force out there and i see a lot of um like what's just what's going on and i'm finding that um-hum and maybe this is just the way it always was people in the secretarial pool um that really stand out are the people that that end up being the supervisors of the departments or the managers or whatever and so even though it might be belittled when they first go for the job um-hum um-hum um-hum it really is a stepping stone to something a lot greater yeah i do know that uh there are plenty of uh executive secretaries whose responsibilities are greater than the CEO's uh that and they may not make the money but they they have a lot of prestige many do make the money too actually but sure and they i know well but they keep the CEO running you know they keep them oh yeah um-hum and sometimes those are men too sometimes those secretaries are men which is good i'm glad to see that change um that's true yep um-hum but you it's it's i've always heard i i don't know if you know this joke it's uh it talks about um this this child and his parents were in a car and there was a car accident and you know that one right right oh yeah and they go to the hospital and uh uh uh one parent what what i guess the the uh father was killed uh yeah right and they get to the hospital and the doctor comes in to uh work on the injured child and says oh i can't uh do that that's my child uh-huh right how does that happen yeah i mean but see it's so obvious i guess the first time i heard it i immediately thought of a doctor because that's what i originally wanted to do so it's but it's amazing how many people do you know for a minute stop and think oh okay well you know i well i think i even did seriously and i yeah i'm i'm yeah sure we're all victims of this sure we've we've been brought up in the society that's perpetrated that problem um-hum right um oh what was oh you know one other place is um women in the Army that i think that's really changed a lot yeah yeah um i i don't know if i necessarily agree with that but i i don't think i agree with the Army but that's a whole different topic well i don't have yeah right right i i suppose my feeling is that it doesn't matter male or female uh at least they if they're given the same opportunity then that's good although they can't always there there are certainly differences of men and women the i guess the other thing that was asked in this to for us to discuss was um what kind of changes this has brought about or what do we see in the future and uh just because this Sunday past Sunday was Mother's Day of course there was some articles in the newspaper about the uh mother s in the work force and that has that has certainly made a tremendous difference in society um-hum oh oh yeah but what is interesting is at least in the Washington Post there was um a a a report of a study that suggested that there were more women now who regretted the necessity for having to work and and leave their young children and that more if given the opportunity if if financial if it were not financially necessary would stay home you know would have the choice would make take make the choice of staying home um-hum yep yep while their children were young um and it's interesting because i don't know if that's a switch if somehow maybe that's being revalued or reevaluated or not i was fortunate enough that um well it was a decision yeah um uh when we had children to make that decision and we determined that we would live on my salary on my husband's salary when we first got married so that when we had children we would not you you know fall into that necessity of having my having to work and so we made that choice we didn't live as well but we lived well enough um-hum um-hum right uh-huh um-hum but you made sacrifices and you gained things you know but uh uh sure but you see for me that was the more more important i know of plenty of friends of friends who did not were not able to make that choice right right and that's difficult because i think in the long run uh part of the problem in society and maybe part of what happens to the bad the negative attitude of women working comes about because children remember the the traumas of their mothers trying to work and run the household and some of those things that that has not changed and i think that's a serious issue yeah yeah right and and and you know and then the marriage suffers because how much time can you physically spend with your husband if your being torn in in all the direction exactly yeah right oh yeah it it's very difficult so that needs to be done and education perhaps education will eventually do it but uh the idea that that all those uh things that were traditionally thought to be the housewife when she was home as a housewife are still hers even if she's out working yeah right um-hum yeah right uh you know that's a serious problem uh right uh one thing that i i think Rochester is being a little proactive um several companies are actually now providing some on site very reasonably uh reasonable cost day care wow that's nice yeah that is great because then at least the child is going with the parent to you know right to the company um-hum and can take care of the child if if if the child is ill or something yeah yeah yeah exactly and then the mother the mother or the father whoever can see them during their lunch or you know the um they're just a lot more available even though they're still at work they're not over at some stranger's house you know um-hum um-hum right and actually i have a few friends who who uh have a a nontraditional a nontraditional uh family in that the husband is is home with the children oh really uh and the wife is is out with the more uh uh nine to five kind of job and then the husband in one case is a is a musician so he does uh was uh uh-huh um-hum oh guitar lessons and does a lot of uh professional playing you know for weekends and so on but essentially it's his wife who uh is the primary uh uh money provider there it's an interesting situation and they have three children um-hum huh it is oh wow uh so and it seems to have worked very well but um but those things are rare i i must say they're still not uh that's great um-hum society still isn't up to just being okay with that you know they're really not um because even the way you say it you you talk about it as the exception you know right and um no no it is the exception yeah  nope did i interrupt your reading schedule no been playing on my computer oh oh and well have you what have you read good lately um lately well well not not even lately tell me well uh let's see last book i read was a science fiction book called Weapon who's it by do you remember um uh it was it was his first book i think not very popular yeah my husband is a big science fiction uh reader but i don't uh care for it as much i don't have uh he's a computer man too so yeah i think that sometimes goes hand in hand yeah what books are you into well uh i'm at a stand still right now but uh um we haven't lived in Charlotte very long um-hum and so uh and our furniture is stored somewhere else so i've had a lot of time i've read a lot of books but and this is uh one group of books i'm wondering if you've read that i i guess i started reading them two or three years ago by Jean Auel uh the first one was Clan of the Cave Bear um-hum no i sure haven't read that oh gosh that is wonderful yeah and then the second uh book of hers was Valley of the Horses and the third one was the Mammoth Hunters are they sounding familiar yeah uh-huh yeah and her last one which i think waited everybody waited about a year or two for to come out um-hum uh uh Plains of Passage hm but uh uh i think Clan and and you have to read them in order you have to read the Clan first um-hum but that has that is the most different book that my i've read in many many years probably since Brave New World uh made such an impact on me many years ago oh yeah that's a good book and my husband says so too um-hum the Clan so it's if you can pick those books up uh and sometimes they're packaged together those first three in paper back uh-huh well the last good book i read would be uh let me think uh the last series i read was Power that Preserves and have you ever read those by Donaldson yes i have yeah with the leper yes yeah good yeah but how do you uh read more realistic books perhaps um what do you mean self-improvement or yeah how-to books yeah lot of computer books i guess yeah yeah i'm into um neural networks and artificial intelligence you're into what i'm i'm terribly i i'm sorry i didn't neural networks and artificial intelligence uh-huh it's kind of what i've been studying in school and stuff uh-huh are you uh working or you a student right now i'm just looking for a job yeah are you well my husband is working uh temporary well under contract we had moved here after twenty years in Oklahoma um-hum um-hum and he in fact he started with uh i guess uh well first generation computers uh-huh and is that called mainframe yeah and uh so he's under contract now with uh an insurance company that has bought many agencies so uh and they really needed he's an accountant also um-hum and so they needed someone to uh uh get things under control so he's been reading a lot about different kinds you know several agencies are on um uh one system uh some others are on other systems right now what's not red house but what's what's that um-hum red house oh i can't not red house uh the system i guess is what i'm trying to talk to um he's converting to it and then they will convert from it to another one later on uh-huh hm but he he's you know he he's good at and he's probably uh as good at troubleshooting as anybody that you can find uh-huh but anyway uh let me talk are you uh are you married oh no do you have a girlfriend yes yeah well there is a book that i want you to recommend to her all right okay uh-huh and it's called and i can't i can't tell you exactly the author i get a lot of authors if i remember title remember the title i sometimes forget the author um-hum and it's called Women of Substance hm and i believe that it's one of also one of the best books that i've ever read and there is a series of them um-hum uh and i it's either by Belva Plain i think it was probably by Belva Plain but if you can just tell her to get that from the library that what's that about it's excellent yeah have you read Silence of the Lambs yet no i saw the movie yeah it's a good movie did you yeah i had i that's not my type of book so but it is my husband's and uh-huh i liked t he movie yeah yeah but uh one other thing i wanted to mention too someone uh a few years ago a dentist and his wife were getting rid of all their paper backs that they've read in the last few years and i they were going to take them down to the uh-huh oh the Y or somewhere like that uh-huh and and i said well let me have them first and go through them and see which ones i want to read and she they said well sure take them all uh just take them to the Y when your finished um-hum and as i divided them into the books that i i would like and my husband picked out the ones he would like um-hum those that he liked all had similar covers huh the ones i liked had similar covers huh and and the what's uh the the more uh those that he liked better were black and silver and gold and red and i'm talking about paper backs you know uh-huh and i thought that was really you know we had two huge piles and all his were shiny like Christmas lights that's weird and mine were just blue and all that well it's been nice talking to you yeah thanks for calling and if i uh if i didn't do anything else i recommended a good book to uh another another woman all right i'll remember that all right bye okay good-bye  okay okay i guess we're set um current events i get my current events basically from news uh just because i watch pretty much a lot of television um television news is it uh CNN or Headline News or just local news or what it uh i watch a little bit of everything i like to tune into CNN to CNN because uh and you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on everything in about five or ten minutes i think news today um right right it's kind of losing its importance like on in in on radio if you hear any news at all it's like two seconds you know really quickly on regular stations right well on commercial radio i guess i i tend to get more of my news from national public radio in the morning on the way to work evening on the way to school so yeah that's good too uh-huh i like KRLD so i don't uh i don't see much TV mostly when i'm in school but i do here yeah where do you go to school uh University of Texas at Dallas oh okay i went to UT at Austin so right but uh i'm a news reporter so i i should get all i can my news from the news from the TV really but um i do tend to throw on Headline News when i'm doing things around the house and just let it play and listen but uh yeah i usually don't intentionally although i should i don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news right or i don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news if it comes on i just happen to hear it now i will intentionally buy a newspaper to watch to to look at the news but other than yeah all i ever get out of the paper is the Sunday paper so yeah that's true i read the comics that's about it yeah that's about it the Sunday paper it's so full of stuff but you pick your favorite section and the rest you throw away although you paid what almost two dollars now to get it but right right i like to listen to uh national public radio on the way to work because it's yeah i don't know it's variety you know they throw in a little news and a little bit of other stuff it um-hum yeah tends to get like Headline News if you listen to it for an hour when you is it is it pretty good coverage on there i mean um-hum yeah it usually is and they throw in a lot of you know a lot of interviews and commentaries it's kind of like getting a newspaper there's a lot of yeah yeah sections to it and they they present different sides of things hum because i find like on KRLD i like to listen to that but each story is like no more than two or three lines you know so it's oh well they spend a little more time you know they cover the headlines and then they go into a lot of issues and things where they they spend five or ten minutes discussing something and interviewing people yeah uh-huh yeah that'd probably be better especially when you listen to the like popular radio stations like mostly the music stations and it's news is is pretty much nonexistent they'll have little little teeny weeny news breaks you know yeah and only in the morning i guess there's a little bit yeah yeah basically i haven't listened to a top forty radio station in so long i wouldn't know yeah so so let's see um and i guess i get some kinds of other of you know business related news through trade journals and things but uh-huh that's about it the only reason i get trade journals is like if i'm looking for a job or something right which is what i'm doing now yeah but uh yeah trying to get out of wherever they are a lot of people are but uh but uh i think i think news is i'm wondering where it's going you know how i think it would be nonexistent pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper uh i know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news and now it's it's kind of your final choice you watch first you go to CNN then you go to radio or something like that i think it yeah well nobody wants to sit down and read yeah yeah it's it takes a lot more time to read something and you've got news bombarding you from everywhere now you know you turn on the TV turn on the radio yeah so much for my effort yeah yeah but i think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again why is that i don't well just because i'm i'm thinking that it it's getting so short on radio just you you still you have two or three i know in Dallas you can probably get two two all news radio stations out of i don't how many popular radio stations and then on television you have just the news at six and ten yeah i just and i just i just see that dwindling in in i find it hard to believe that people'll go back to reading over television i mean just given the way society is and i enjoy reading but most people would rather turn on the tube and true yeah true that's true too yeah and and flip through the channels you know and get the headline news that thirty minutes of than sit down and take the effort to read the paper right and they don't have to go get one you know one thing i like about the paper um as opposed to television is that uh when i like when i report because i'm in television i have to get the basic the main facts and that's it that's all you have time for whereas in the paper i like to read the articles because they get every side every single side and right right and every point they make you know and and it's all there right well that's why i like uh national public radio because when they get on one of these little they they give you headlines that are brief uh-huh just they touch on what's going on and then they'll get into something and really explore it um-hum um-hum and it's it's informative it's a lot more informative than you know a quick half hour news show that yeah yeah they tell you what they want you to hear yeah because that's what we do i mean it's like each each story is thirty seconds right you know so it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time so and it'll probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by i think yeah there's so much going on in the world communication you know spans the world now and oh yeah there's too much going on you can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there i think that is one good thing one great thing about news and that we saw right during the war just now is that we got all the information within minutes you know whatever happened we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it yeah and the question is how much of it or some how some of it i guess there's a lot of debate about censorship and and what we're really seeing is it is it the true story or is it a little bit biased yeah yeah um-hum yeah because even though we do get the story right away they were censored as to what they could tell us so all we had to sit here and and ask is well what aren't they telling us right you know so that that was pretty scary but we i talked to one woman and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia she wouldn't want to know you know that they're bombing or or this and that's going on and at the same time i talked to another woman and she was so happy to know because she lived through Vietnam and she didn't know what was happening at that time and she was so happy to get the information right you know so it's just a lot of different opinions on that i i you know i like to to know what's going on sometimes i think there's just a little bit too much yeah you know you get in the habit of like i say turn on Headline News and it'll play over and over and you just tune it out because it's the same thing but yeah and then too a lot of times i think uh especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion it's like yeah they tend to dramatize things that are you know like this Kennedy thing it's just i mean everywhere you turn Kennedy Kennedy Kennedy you know what kind of shoes did he wear on the night and you know it's just like okay this is ridiculous yeah like who cares really so well but what are you doing something on a computer oh i heard the little clicking yeah trying to do some C programming oh okay well it was nice talking to you okay take care bye-bye okay take care um-hum bye  okay what kind of crafts and hobbies do you have oh not very many of those at uh sometimes i i play the trumpet and sometimes i work on trumpet mouthpieces uh-huh and then i have a five year old daughter and we cut out things kind of you know and color and uh and uh use markers and things like that uh-huh um how about you um well i used to be more into crafts when i was younger like high school stuff i was in 4H and i did a lot of latch hook made rugs and stuff um uh-huh and uh i've learned how to crochet but i don't really know i mean i don't do it that much not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather's really bad i'd rather be outside um yeah exactly um i used to play trombone uh-huh i don't know if that was a not really i don't play it that much any more but i'd um what else do i do mainly do reading i don't have a lot of crafty type things i do uh-huh but uh what are some other things you like enjoy i don't know my my father is in the in the antique business uh-huh and he uh he goes around to garage sales and he buys all kinds of um china and figurines and statues and stuff and um there's some stuff that's really for um uh auto repair it's called J B Weld uh-huh uh-huh and i repaired a a gasoline tank with it once but he mixes colors in it it's an epoxy resin that you mix together oh cool and he makes like the other day he was working on a hand that was shattered on a a statue that's real small it's like about maybe the hand's about the size of a cricket oh wow and uh has uh like the forefinger sticking out and the thumb sticking out and he was repairing that and uh it came out pretty good it's kind of a kind of a ivory color all over and and uh has some age spots in it and it looked uh-huh you know just like it it had been there all the time huh and he fixed some fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them and uh molds that in he had a blue blue bowl a few weeks ago that he he fixed that way uh-huh it worked out real well too do you ever huh and then he and then he um he thatches uh you know those uh thatched chairs yeah course that's like that that uh hooking that you were talking about yeah that takes a lot of time that's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff yeah and he used to paint um a long time ago but i think he's stopped pretty much now oh but outside of outside of art class in in school i i stopped doing most of that unless i i mean like he has a computer and i use um the graphics yeah um software on that to uh to do figures and to to look at things you know see how they work right that sounds interesting uh-huh um does he ever uh refinish furniture or anything like that oh yeah sometimes but it's it's not one of my favorite things especially from the vapors and we had uh an entertainment center we did last year uh we bought it at an unfinished uh furniture place uh-huh and sanded it down and uh stained it and then lacquered over it it's pretty time consuming isn't it oh yeah but it's good it's nice to have it when you're done i mean looks pretty so um-hum sure is i've done that once but it didn't come out that well did you use a did you use a Zar stain uh i don't remember it was i had my parents buy everything and i ended up it was their table their kitchen table it came out really dark uh they had a um well i saw the commercial on TV and they and uh and the people at the unfinished store recommended it that's called a it's Z A R uh-huh and uh it spreads real evenly and it doesn't dry too fast so it's if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out and uh yeah and we put we put tung oil on it kind of made it sticky for a while but after it dried out it was you know it was real hard and it was all right i remember took me a long time it took me like several months or several weeks to do it during the summer and then after i got it done it was pretty dark and ended up not being real smooth looking uh-huh since since i've moved away they've had it redone so i kind of kind of gave that hobby up real quick yeah but i don't know like i said i like doing a lot of outdoor stuff so but during 4H i mean they really encouraged to do all kinds of crafty stuff which is interesting interesting i like that uh-huh were you in the were you in the Girl Scouts too or no well yeah when i was real young i was for a couple years excuse me so uh anyway it was nice talking to you Dudley well it was nice talking to you have a good day now bye okay you too bye-bye  what are some of the things that you do with them well my oldest son is eleven and he is really into sports and my little girl just started sports anyway my oldest son he plays baseball right now and he's a pitcher on his team and he's doing really well and we go to all the ball games and everything and his dad's a scoutmaster and so he's a scout in the troop and they spend a lot of troop time together doing scouting things wow uh my little girl she's seven and and just got through with soccer and so we would we'd have to split time and my husband would go one place and i'd go the other place but we one or the other would be at the games uh-huh and then i have a four year old and we spend time here at home i read to him and things like that as a matter of fact one thing our family does is we try to uh go to the library and everybody gets books and then i we get one book that we read together like story at the end of the day just before they go to bed and then i have a brand new baby and uh oh she takes a lot of time so i guess that's the time i spend with her feeding her diapering her you know that kind of stuff rocking her oh my well you have two boys and two girls don't you yeah came out even well yes oh well it sounds like really sounds like you do wonderful things uh in fact uh i don't know uh enough families who do what you're doing now a lot of families don't have that option well um i think a lot of families don't but i think a lot of families do and don't exercise it yeah yeah uh sometimes i feel that acquiring things becomes uh so important and instead of uh just putting in your time in those early years yeah uh i i've seen it quite a bit with uh as you can tell probably know i'm older than you i have two only they're both uh away from home and uh uh-huh they they engaged in the sports activities and it was interesting though our son really never wanted us to go we wanted to go because we had moved around quite a bit and that's a wonderful way to meet friends too other families oh uh-huh but he was a little shy about our going uh-huh but we did maybe every other game well i get up there and yell and everything i'm a yeller and my poor son he says it's okay as long as i don't call him honey yes as long as i don't say go honey well when you said he was a pitcher i think oh gosh that is so hard on mothers well it's it's um tense gets real tense sometimes well being uh and i think other people uh tend to not uh remember that that is a child yeah yeah it can be that way that's really true and you have to try and remember that too especially when they're littler this year we're kind of on a winning team um-hum and we we beat a team rather profoundly and you can't help but feel bad but we had our years when they were growing up that we were beaten real soundly too sure so you know um i guess it's all in the age and as you grow up and you get better and and they should they need to have that uh feeling of accomplishment also yeah yeah i think one thing like you were saying is we need to remember that it they're just kids though this is not the pros or any big time thing we need to remember they're children um-hum well i had friends whose uh son played basketball and uh he was on a team for two years and maybe got into uh two or three games both uh during the seasons for a minute or two oh no and i just think that is so terrible yeah yeah unbelievable i don't know how a coach could even do that i know that here in Plano we have regular basketball and that's what my child plays during the basketball season and then they have what they call classic and the best players play and the ones that are just barely new sit on the bench most of the time they play a little bit just like what you just said um-hum um-hum and and i we just don't want our boy to do that you know no no well and i think after he gets older and if everybody knows that that uh they're willing to when the son gets very good and they want to get on one a little bit more high powered team then he can excel right or if he wants to bid his buy his time a little bit sitting on the bench until he comes of age maybe another year or something yeah yeah but i think they certainly have to know what kind of team they're getting on right well i love to hear about your reading too so many mothers and fathers don't uh uh take their children to the library i used to have a bookmobile that came by our house oh that's great it was wonderful and we could take as many books as we wanted to yeah they didn't come but about every two weeks and so you know you can go through a lot of books really um well that's a good amount of time two weeks yeah uh-huh so it was just really wonderful so oh that sounds great you know i used to read to them and now my two oldest can read to me every so often and that's really been fun too that they read to me yes there was an experiment here well i don't guess it was an experiment it was just a project in uh one of the schools here in Charlotte one of the elementary schools uh where the kids uh didn't watch television for a couple of weeks uh-huh uh-huh and uh there was a lot of cooperation i think uh among the parents and children with this and many that they interviewed afterwards said no they really didn't didn't miss it they they got kind of used to it and it was okay yeah so yeah and they say when you don't watch TV as much you're more creative and and imaginative in your own mind of games to play and things to do well of course instead of just being entertained all the time um-hum yeah i worry about the couch potato uh yeah syndrome yes well Clarisse it's been very enjoyable talking to you yeah oh Terry i just appreciate you too oh thank you so much thanks have a good day you too bye okay bye-bye  and what movies have you seen recently well we aren't just real big go to the you know first time it comes out kind of thing we neither one like to stand in line so we uh a lot of times will just kind of hold on until it comes to a dollar theater or i don't blame you we're the same something or maybe rent the video although i prefer the dollar theater because it is kind of fun and i say dollar theater i think they're actually two dollars these days right there's been inflation all the way along it's like saying go to the five and dime you know it's not five and dime anymore but the um-hum a analogy is there right but um uh we have teenagers and we have we have a guideline i shan't say rule that uh you know we like to see the movies that they want to see first um-hum um so that we can kind of talk about it and decide whether it's really appropriate or you know or not and uh we're probably stricter than most parents i know we are because i know that my children's friends even the youngest ones routinely see things that well i know that my kids have gone to things that i would never set foot in but they haven't gone with me and i haven't paid the bill um-hum so there's are there are an awful lot of movies that i just think are uh unconscionable to be shown on especially to kids and i have had to hope that they would enforce the R ratings and not let kids under eighteen in um-hum um-hum and i don't really think they do i mean uh excuse me we're having an pollen attack here and i'm having hay fever excuse me oh bless your heart i've i've have a throat that is so sore i know exactly what you mean just from that oh but anyway anyway um my kids are now twenty one and twenty four so i don't have to with absolutely no you know do anything now yeah yeah but once in a while what i try to do is try to entice them into something that i think is going to be useful or educational or something so the two yeah yeah recent recent films that we have seen where i've been able to drag them along um are the uh Henry the Fifth the Kenneth Bronoff uh-huh version and Rosencranz and Gilgenstern are Dead oh which were wonderful really both of them were just outstandingly good well excellent acting wonderful sets costumes and really worthwhile um-hum um-hum we uh i guess probably the last one that we really paid full price for was um oh the Russian one that they made the book hum i'm a bad one to ask because i don't i think the submarine the uh with Sean Connery there we go oh yes yes i know the one you're talking about Hunt for Red October yes there we go which i was so glad that uh my husband had read the book before we went because otherwise he you know he had to kind of sit and explain it along the way to me that uh you know that uh i thought it was very well done though uh-huh uh oh yes well uh my husband went and took his son and he enjoyed it a lot but i've never cared much for war and spy movies so they let me stay home and work in the garden um-hum yeah yeah that was a a nice trade but they thought it was a good movie and uh i like Sean Connery so i said if it comes out on video i'll be willing to pay the two dollars to rent it and then if i'm bored i don't feel like i've lost a lot and i can turn it off um-hum um-hum that's right that's right we uh have have have thoroughly enjoyed the uh Dancing with Wolves um-hum that was uh i guess we paid full price for that one too well i that one was very unnerving for me i uh i have an American uh native American heritage and um i knew going into it that it was probably affect me deeply um-hum um and i was right it definitely did definitely did it definitely did well uh i have to tell you a comment that the man whose office is next door to mine goes to a lot of movies and uh he will come back with his capsule review and he said um-hum well it has absolutely beautiful scenery but you wouldn't like it because of the cruelty to animals and any movie i have to say i where i notice the scenery means i didn't like the plot so well i have to agree with you it that that part of it was somewhat unnerving although it was cruelty to animals yes but not kinds of things um you know it was very much in the natural you know the way it really probably was not some sadistic crazed person you know who's going around pulling the wings off flies and birds you know swinging cats by their tail not not that kind of yeah uh torturistic type thing you know it was uh-huh but it it was awfully graphic that way but well i keep telling people that i don't go to movies where there's lots of blood and uh shootings and i certainly don't go to horror films oh yes i agree oh i if they are are trying on purpose to scare me then i don't want to go i'm certainly not going to give them money to do it absolutely not oh i'll tell you one though that i heard such good things about um oh let's see what was it um it's a David Lynch movie and it's about Sailor and Lula they're the two characters main characters i can't remember the name of the film now well i'll but anyway got lots of just wonderful reviews and i had heard that it had violence in it but i thought well i'll go give it a try and the first five minutes of that movie were so disgusting that i went and got my money back said i'm leaving i did i told my husband i've got a book in the car give me the car keys you can stay and watch this if you want to but i don't need this yeah and i just got up and left and in about two more minutes he joined me and we asked for ou r money back i said you know i i realize that this is advertised as an R movie and i had heard that it contained violence but i had no idea that this was what i was getting myself into how disgusting this was going to be and in the five minutes i watched there was no let up it was it was just filthy um-hum yeah and there's and now i don't mind uh nudity and i don't mind suggestiveness if it's appropriate to the story i'm not a prude and i'm not a prig but i do not see any reason why you should have one string of filthy language with no intermission in it and uh graphic violence and blood and uh it total disregard for human beings um-hum um-hum one of the i read something here just a while back about it was a newspaper thing just about the movie moguls and the television writers and what not that basically they individually personally are not even close to living the lives that the normal American person does that oh yeah we uh excuse me and i think that's got to be true if you look at what they produce that they think is the ideal normal person so how could they possibly you know so when they do find something that relates to some of us you know it's just kind on the seedy um side of our lives you know it's not the uplifting yeah and most of us aren't that seedy yeah exactly we're a lot more mundane and humdrum and at least the ones with the money to go to the movie right you know we uh we saw that little Home Alone with our children at Christmas uh you know thoroughly enjoyed that but it was uh you know i heard that was real cute totally different you know kind of thing and even in that there were a few things that had i been making it i wouldn't have put in you know so but uh um-hum but you know we uh we try to you know catch things when they come back on the television and they're redone yeah you know so that the bad language is out and the heavier scenes are um-hum removed for the kids we rent a lot of the old musicals and Broadway type things you know for the kids to watch here at home and try to there's a theater here in town that has uh been renovated by a foundation to its heyday of the twenties and it has the big old organ and everything and the big screen and they show only movies made before nineteen fifty um-hum oh how fun oh how fun and it is just great we go to that probably once a month or more uh at the very beginning when they were having film festivals like a Katherine Hepburn festival and a Fred Astaire festival and so on we were going a couple of nights a week and it's great for one thing it's not i wish they'd do something like that in Dallas well it's not full of rowdy teenagers who are uh spilling their Cokes and throwing their popcorn and talking all the time mostly middle age folks who are pretty decorous and sit still and listen to the film that's true but that's cute and they get these absolutely terrific prints that are from the uh film archives in Los Angeles that have just been specially restored and sometimes they are made from the original negatives so they're really crisp and good so they're really crisp and good like they were when they first came out um-hum oh that's neat though that's you know that's good i wish more teenagers would take up some of those that they realize that they can be entertained and and enjoy a and you can go to a movie like that and you know that it's going to be entertaining and it's going to have some wit in the dialogue evening's activity  okay um about crime um what are your concerns well my uh uh basic concern is that overall we have uh such a overcrowding in the prisons now that uh judges are actually um-hum uh basing their decisions on what they do with criminals once they are caught right i agree that uh probation and stuff like that is uh becoming more and more prevalent uh prevalent and more people are getting out a year earlier and so there's less you know motivation for people to you know deterrent i guess the deterrent value has gone down i know it i agree right yeah i know it they've taken the deterrent out of crime anymore it seems like and just i don't know i'd never i don't think the punishment fits the crime on most of these things anyway uh some people just get a slap on the wrist for murder it seems like and then others get you know a a horrible sentence for practically nothing i just can't understand you know what they're of course i know i think dope has a lot to do with a lot of the crimes we have and dope and yeah um-hum all that sort of stuff but and i think they've tied policemen's hands a lot too on some you know some laws out there tied their hands where they you know can't arrest them or can't shoot or anything like that yeah i know it's a you can't shoot a fleeing felon or something oh you know just ridiculous yeah it gets sort of hard and then uh they get information from people and their attorney isn't present and they can't use it you know because they just assumed that the guy was you know tortured or beaten into uh giving his confession yeah yeah um-hum right absolutely absolutely and and these lawyers i get so made at them because they or defense lawyers any way they just seem like they no get these guys out on the flimsiest excuses you know and uh i don't know really makes me mad some of these things that they come up with that i just can just boggles my mind that a judge is even i remember reading in the paper where a a guy was suing uh let's see who was he suing the parents of this girl he had murdered because he said if they had been stricter parents she wouldn't have been out and he wouldn't have murdered raped and murdered her and so he was suing them and i thought that shouldn't have even come to court you know that should have been laughed out of court isn't that pitiful i yeah that i don't what ever happened but that is amazing oh brother i hear your little baby crying yeah yeah he's a little upset he doesn't see me is he bless his heart oh so he's like oh where'd you go you disappeared down here Stephen um how old is he he's uh ten months oh ten months my goodness um-hum yeah he's getting to be a big boy really is that your only child uh no i have another one that's two oh oh my goodness you guys have your hands full don't you well yeah both of them in diapers oh my goodness yeah that's a that's a little of a work load two boys yeah i guess that's uh oh my yeah but uh my wife's home during the day so oh okay so she uh she does has most of the fun time that helps yeah yeah you get to come home and really enjoy them probably uh-huh oh okay back to crime we're supposed to find out what let's see what are our concerns or what do we think did she say what what do do do we can solve it or something i think yeah right um-hum i'm like you i think the judges need to or i don't know build more prisons i don't care you know or and execute some of these guys that are on death row you know yeah i think that's probably the that that seems to be the guiding factor with the judges they say hey we'd like to convict more of them but you know we don't have a place to put them so what are we supposed to do yeah right and if they would you know when they send these guys to the death penalty kill them you know quit wasting our taxpayers' money by having appeals appeals appeals appeals just get them on and kill them and go on with it you know and and uh yeah right empty there's there's a bunch on death row we'd empty a lot bunch of beds if we'd uh uh you know do what we're supposed to do and get on with it but and to me that that's a yeah right if you don't want to have the death penalty take it away but you know make up your mind hum that's right and if you know if uh uh i know Texas is one of the leading ones that we we've probably executed probably more than i think Texas Florida Florida yeah and Louisiana and Alabama yeah yeah the southern states are are more into that and yeah i know they have it up here but it takes you know they just keep appealing it appealing it appealing it yeah yeah uh-huh and then they just get out for and it's going to take a few years for it to kick in yeah and then they get out for good behavior you know and that makes but see i don't care what they say i think the death penalty is a deterrent to some to to to some extent and you know um-hum about did did you watch sixty minutes the other night about criminals those prisoners being given a free education from Boston University and i thought and i thought golly and this uh one guy said you know if they want to give out a free education there is a lot of poor people that'll like to have a uh degree from B U you know why give it to these criminals who aren't going to be able to use it anyway you know and i just yeah right um-hum makes me sick that they could they're mollycoddle i remember down here one time the judge ordered the uh i think the prisoners complained that didn't have color TV so they had to give them colored TV as a cruel and unusual punishment because they didn't have colored TV they had to watch black and white oh God um-hum right oh my word yeah i i think the deterrent would uh really make a difference tha t and oh you know uh paying cops a little bit more you know because the police officers we have they're either you know there are some that have that are actually going corrupt because they don't get any money and there are some that yeah yeah sure the best quality people are not going into the force because they say hey you know there's better things i can do you know that's right my son in law is a police man here and um he makes he makes pitiful i his wife makes more than he does and i think that's a shame that that happens um-hum there's yeah there's some people that are dedicated and will do it anyway and then there's some that you know the police department would say well it actually would like to turn this particular person down but we need them you know yea h that's the way he um-hum yeah right right and um i'm sure you or they're forced into you know having so many minorities and whether they're qualified or not they hire them because they have to have that ratio Blacks and Whites and Hispanics so they uh that's uh what's happening to a lot of them i think they're getting and these guys probably aren't good cops anyway but they were in the right place at the right time and the right minority so they they're getting on i'm i'm sure i know there's some good minority policeman but yeah right uh they're not applying for the job i mean it's the minorities but they're not applying for the jobs especially yeah and i think quotas like and they do have quotas i guarantee you they've got quotas they have to have so many um yeah right and uh like i say whether and that's the same with the fire department anything else and right if they're not qualified they shouldn't have it you know i don't think they should lower the standards just so they can pass the test or anything and that's what they do a lot they just lower the standards a little bit and that way more people qualify and i think that's um-hum right um-hum right i think that that is true well i better get going see what he's doing okay we've had our five minutes haven't we okay thank you bye-bye thank you bye-bye  so okay do you regularly exercise regularly yeah i sure do what do you do uh i ride a bicycle quite a bit and uh work out with free weights okay i love to ride a bicycle i live right near White Rock Lake so i used to i try to ride about ten to twenty miles a day but i oh that's good haven't been doing so well this year i went an last year i went an was exercising on a bike for a while and i when i'd gotten back i had gotten some sun that day the sweat had built up on me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel it was the sweating not the burn oh that's weird that was wild but i exercise i don't exercise now i just had a baby three months ago i haven't really gotten back into exercising but i exercised real good for a couple of years it was oh yeah aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week and it was running three nights a week so what's your motivation what was my motivation yeah a friend of mine always pushing me this was in Louisiana and she would push you know she was hey let's go do it and you know she wouldn't take no for an answer was it for health or to look good oh i just i just wanted to look good i would think yeah it weren't really health related it was just a side benefit yeah yeah because i'm not um i'm not big or anything but i'm not in great shape so but when i worked out i got in pretty good shape i didn't build up muscle though i just got real good and toned yeah i don't think women look good with muscles up to a point up to a point no more yeah it's just some of those women that come up there looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it yeah yeah so what was what was the other question let's see do you do it as a task or do you enjoy enjoy working out i guess it's a task because i can't make myself do it lately yeah i think i uh i enjoy it sometimes and there's other times when i just get tired of it and yeah and i feel like i'm obligated to do it because i've been doing it so i should keep up you don't want to lose yourself and there's some days it's just like it's the hardest thing in the world to to get started well how old are you i'm uh twenty seven okay so you're still young yeah still young getting older we all are so yep but uh yeah it's not hard to stay well if you keep working out when you're young though when you get older you know your body's not going to look as bad i seen an old woman today she was about eighty and she looked so good i mean she was standing just as straight and tall and she had a small waist and she didn't have you know like you know how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle yeah right and she didn't have that at all she her lips were a little bit wide but a lot of back in her time they liked women with big hips anyway right so she may be keeping that on purpose so yeah i notice if you uh if you stay in shape you don't age as bad um-hum i think too i was i go to school too at night and last semester i had stopped working out because i hurt myself and started smoking a lot and you just those kind of things age you more well smoking ages you quick it puts those little wrinkles around your lips right and right and you can't and then you know it just kind of feeds itself you smoke and then you don't work out because you you get winded yeah right and so i oh i smoke a pack a day and i finally quit because like i just all i was doing was going down hill fast oh and i can't quit smoking i've tried i was telling a friend of mine that be almost almost as bad as being an alcoholic can't quit smoking yeah i've tried i just can't do it i quit when i was pregnant with my kids but you know as soon as i had them right back to it right back to them yeah yeah it was like you know that was the only reason i quit i didn't want to and i don't want to quit smoking i enjoy that i said i have very few vices i'll keep this one thank you but uh yeah yeah did you ever go to like one of those health clubs or anything i went to a health club a few years ago and now i work out at home because i don't really my schedule with school and work i don't have time to get down to one uh-huh there used to be one that was a twenty four hour that i used to go to but uh i actually prefer to work out alone i like to work out with people i need like you i i need competition is what i need i've got to have somebody to compete with or i don't want to do anything really yeah i wouldn't mind having you know working out with a friend and and stuff but when you get into some of these some of these health clubs where you just stand around and wait um-hum are you you know i like to start get it done and get out of there uh-huh are you married or anything no no i'm not well get your girlfriend to work out with you a lot of women like that i'd love it if my husband would ask me to work out with him he doesn't work out very often course he don't need to he's small and he works as a laborer on the railroad so you know he's building his muscles up all day he doesn't have to do anything he can eat like a horse too yeah right and he don't you know he don't gain it like i do but uh uh especially having a kid i guess tends to just gain weight because you have to to yeah yeah you have to well you can gain too much weight i gained a little bit too much but i looked to uh with my first little boy i did gain a lot of weight i got i got about fifty pounds overweight with him and i didn't loose it until two years ago and then i got pregnant and you know ruined that so set to start all over yeah well actually like i say it ain't as bad this time because i was in shape when i got pregnant right i wasn't out of shape i wasn't overweight with when i got pregnant with him i just wasn't in in shape i don't know the difference but yeah some people are a little bit fanatical about it you know i about weight well yeah and about exercise working out and fitness you know i like to to work out to look good and stay in shape and you know i know it's good for me but people that live for it and you know eat a bunch of different pills and wel l that's what my friend did all that kind of stuff it gets a little bit well she was she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else and really we was you know even with her taking all those expensive expensive vitamins and stuff obsessive yeah we stayed right on the same track with each other you know developing and everything now there you can take those uh what is it yeah steroids steroids yeah i couldn't think i was going i was trying to say hemorrhoids no i was trying to say hem hormones yeah hormones but yeah uh steroids but i stay from that crap yeah there's really bad for you hem hormones yeah it's too dangerous oh i wouldn't i could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something yeah i had a friend whose brother did steroids and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out it all turned to fat and it just really really looked bad ooh but uh i didn't know it did that i don't know if it does to everybody he was it it just that's how it affected him and he i don't know just yeah but i've been wanting to get me a bicycle or a bike i've been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around i'm scared to run for dogs course i know dogs can get you on a bike too but yeah seems like it at least you got a chance to outrun them that way yeah i don't like to run myself i've thought about it several times and i just it i like to move a little faster and cover more ground well they yeah they've come up that running is not as good for you as they thought it was it's probably i would think it would be hard on your your legs and your joints and stuff yeah it's real hard on your legs and it's hard on women and it it just makes stuff move down and uh but i i i like jogging i don't mind that i can get out and do that as long as it's not hot if it's hot you can't do that yeah uh i can't but in the rain oh i love to run in the rain just you know be careful not to slide yeah but you can't ride your bike at all in the rain can you no you can't you slide it's dangerous at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires uh-huh you slide all over the place yeah oh i when i did ride my friends bike that one time i had uh i don't know what i was trying to do i was trying to make a U turn and i never could make a U turn in a bike i can do it in my car but i tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked and i told her a dog was chasing me but i wrecked it into the curb i didn't hurt it too bad i scratched it on the the oh she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire i think but oh well yeah anyway it's been nice talking to you yeah well and uh good luck with the the new kid thank you she's it she's good anyway have fun exercising all right bye-bye all right bye bye  do you have any special menus that you like to use when you're entertaining well i don't entertain that much anymore unfortunately but uh yes but we dream if hum we dream though oh yes well i mean you know like for holidays the family gets together so uh i guess you'd call that about the same i mean i don't have dinner parties but uh uh i have family get-togethers yes well uh and i i guess it's about the same thing so uh are you a traditional cook well no no i in fact i love to find different things uh i'm always searching for recipes that are different uh some things are traditional okay uh we always have turkey for Thanksgiving but uh uh there but i always try to add at least one new dish um-hum uh i find it uh interesting to yeah vary it i do to so that uh uh but uh uh well i you know it you can do a lot of things the meat is is pretty standard usually i mean you pick a different kind of you pick whatever kind of meat you're going to have and um sure you uh can do a a a few things with it you know but uh but i mean as far as salads or vegetables there are so many things that you can do these days that uh then you can oh yes it makes it quite a challenge and it depends on whose coming too yes uh for a holiday family get-together i don't make any you know i'm not real picky about exactly what it is but if we're just getting together uh you know for a family uh dinner then i try to keep it as uh fat free and as cholesterol free and you know all that other stuff as i can yeah i have a son-in-law who is a wonderful cook and uh my daughter reads cookbooks and he cooks but uh for the last few years i have uh had something different for him every holiday uh for Christmas or Thanksgiving whichever one they're with us and uh i think the two that have been the biggest hits uh i think one of them came out of the Martha Stewart cookbook you're familiar with Martha Stewart her all of her culinary delights and it was it wasn't all that you know yummy and it it wasn't a lot to eat but it was interesting caramelized caramelized onions right oh yes um-hum oh interesting and uh you cut them in half and turn them over with the cut you know don't peel them or anything and turn them over with the cut side down and you bake them like two hours and a half on about two seventy five or something like that um-hum and then when you know until they're kind of well not really burned they call them caramelized and then you uh you mix up this little uh mixture of cranberries and sugar and a few nuts and uh a little bit of liquid and then you bake that for about thirty minutes and then you it's just a really pretty condiment really actually um-hum and so then you just eat the insides you know the few layers of onions that didn't get hard or anything and then uh then that filling but that was interesting and another interesting one that he liked so well was turnips i've always had a neighbor or two that had wanted to bring me turnips well who not many people like turnips right but i did a casserole using half turnips half potatoes Swiss cheese milk and butter and just baked them and it is absolutely wonderful hum if and the secret is using half potatoes right yeah i could see that would be then it wouldn't be such a an overpowering flavor you know it would be uh just just a flavor but not you know the real strong that's the only thing turnips have such a strong flavor to them now i love them raw but and that Swiss oh i do too oh especially so many people like them to dip in vegetable dip too i think yes now you know speaking of vegetable dip i was introduced to uh to to something by a girlfriend of mine recently that i never would have dreamed of because of you know usually when you think of a vegetable uh tray you think of uh uh broccoli or cauliflower and and celery and the the you know standard things have you ever tried using raw sweet potato uh-huh no well i'm glad to hear about that try try it i was she she i picked it up i thought it was carrot at first you know we were she just had a veggie tray and i picked it up and tasted i said gee this doesn't taste like carrot she said it isn't uh-huh so i took another one just to see if i could figure out what it was and i couldn't and she told me it was raw sweet potato and um it is it i do i do not like sweet potatoes cooked uh-huh i do not like them at all uh i really do enjoy them raw it with this it's it's not a real uh strong flavor it's just kind of light flavor well i'll be darned and you've eaten them do you know when i was growing up my mother wouldn't let us eat raw sweet potatoes she said they were poison hum oh my goodness so so we just you know raw potatoes yes if she was peeling potato and we were you know she'd we'd want a piece and uh but she wouldn't never let us so i suppose that is a myth isn't it right oh yes uh um i hope so because of i've sure eaten a lot of it since i was first introduced to it uh yes yeah you're still alive and kicking yeah but uh uh people are quite surprised to find out it's just not one of the things that you would think of of putting on the vegetable tray uh no and it is colorful too it is colorful adds a lot of color to your tray well i have spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma and so i've had a wonderful time with Mexican type dishes the Santa Santa Fe influence as well as the Tex-Mex and i have so many wonderful recipes and oh i love that uh-hum uh my family here i we're originally from this part of country um-hum if i do any of those casseroles especially they will say um this is sort of spicy yes i know it's funny but see i'm originally from California and my my husband was from New Mexico and uh the first uh-huh ten years we were in Maryland my sister-in-law mailed us care packages of chili peppers and uh things that you couldn't condiments that you couldn't get for Mexican cooking here Spanish cooking you know that uh uh and now of course i can get them all here yes um-hum you know here in Maryland too because it's become popular out here too and they have several Mexican restaurants but when we first moved here twenty years ago we c ouldn't find any kind of you know finally the Taco Bell started springing up except for yes uh well we have several uh very well uh Chi Chi is uh very nice restaurants that uh serve uh uh real good you know Mexican food but but i know uh i have visited my sister-in-law in New Mexico once or twice and um it is yeah it's it's always refreshing because it's so she always fixes something different that i've you know not had so uh i need to try a few more recipes and but you're right anybody that tastes it even the mild they are so surprised that it's uh that spicy uh um-hum um yeah they really don't my friends and relatives really don't like it very well hum-um not if it's spicy now you have to either go completely you know and let them add the uh like the salsa or the sauce to it um or um uh-huh well it well it depends on what you're making if you're making enchiladas it's hard to do that but uh it's well it's hard to let them add their own you know just to make it spicy you can even the enchilada sauce is a little bit spicy really um-hum well it's been fun talking to you well it's nice talking to you and uh good luck in your uh entertaining or cooking or get-togethers or whatever and dream on oh yes uh well you too you too thank you um-hum bye bye bye-bye  what kind of painting are you planning to do well i have wallpaper in both of my bathrooms right now which is really pretty disgusting uh-huh and um it's a rent house and i decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper so i decided i'm going to paint uh-huh and i've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint and i'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them oh what would be interesting either that or maybe rag rolling to give it kind of a country look uh-huh yeah i've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments but they look very interesting and you get some beautiful effects with them yeah uh one of the books that i bought where it's describing describing the sponge painting said you can like layer different colors and yes yeah i've seen that done where there's uh oh i saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat and then it had a little bit darker sort of peachy color uh-huh and in between there was a sort of a rust uh put on very sparingly and it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco ooh yeah um what i what i'm trying to do is i've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms so i want something that's going to tie that together uh-huh and i'm changing the like the towel racks and stuff the the fixtures out to make them wood i'm going to put wood in there so it's going to have kind of a country look um oh yeah that should be nice uh-huh and i haven't even decided as far as um what kind of paint to buy i don't have an actual instruction book so i'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now well uh um it's going to be a big experiment yeah i was about to say you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing yeah because you might find that it's beyond uh what you're willing to put into it yeah yeah although i think it could turn out really nice i haven't ever done fancy painting but i sure did my share of just regular painting uh i've painted several houses inside no i yeah i've um-hum inside never painted the outside what what kind of what kind of paint do you normally use well uh we used a latex uh wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork and my job was mostly the woodwork okay uh-huh my husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers and i got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine uh trim work um-hum where i'd use a small brush and uh try to keep the paint from dripping on the windows and things like that um-hum well we only have one only one of our bathroom has a window in it so i'm hoping that um it won't be too much of a a problem uh-huh i'm i'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first because i i think well i was going to ask if you planned to paint over it or try to strip it no i'm i'm planning on taking it off i have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now which make it much easier to get wallpaper off uh hm i tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago oh with a just a scraper and wet sponge and it took forever i would not recommend that method okay uh if well that's something that that's worthwhile checking into then because i if you can rent a steamer if it's modern wallpaper it should come off without too much trouble If it's really old you don't know what it's put on with it it's hard to tell it's the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style yeah and i know the house um was built around the mid fifties uh-huh so it may be the original wallpaper could be yeah um if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too if it's paper it will probably shred um in one bathroom it's um it's probably paper uh it's silver silver and yellow and white um uh-huh well the wallpaper that i was trying to remove was black this this was in a bathroom too and the the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white and the the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background and then it had vivid uh almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise and lime green and silver and uh a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that um that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom oh it was awful it was absolutely hideous and and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it and a a guest went in there and he said it's a good thing i went to the bathroom before dinner because if i had had something to drink and went in there i would think i was having hallucinations really well i i've also been thinking about after looking at all these magazines um these design magazines and stuff i'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls too in a color that will kind of um tie in our um our um our uh comforter um with a color that's kind of um um burgundy and green and yellow and blue and beige floral design um and i'm not really sure um-hum um-hum i don't know if maybe i'm biting off more than i can chew well i'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale yeah well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting it wouldn't be any kind of special um special effects type thing sure yeah it would be just plain paint well it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time because if you uh use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out uh all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it and it can be done a whole lot faster hm okay and with rollers and uh modern latex paints you can wash up easily because they're water soluble uh-huh and they dry fast so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend if you have some help hm and then if that if you discover the little tricks and tips about you know how you get through corners and how you do trim and uh how long to leave the masking tape down because if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when it it it peels the paint off when you take it off yeah when you pull it up um-hum well not i if you leave it on for weeks it'll do that if you take it up the next day it should be fine you want it to get dry but not uh just real hard you don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried too hard that's the problem it'll come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long yeah okay yeah and i've i was told i always used the nice wide masking tape but i've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth because it oh really okay uh it rips as you pull it off for one thing and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape um and the whole point of using it is to save yourself work you can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape but use use good uh stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands that will go down and come up easily okay well i really appreciate all the helpful tips i think you are just made my project a lot easier well i wish you very good luck with it and i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business the last time i had something done was my kitchen cabinets and i decided that was too much to tackle i'd hire a professional if you were if you were closer i'd i'd i'd tell you you could come over and supervise well if i were closer i might oh well i hope your project turns out great and i really uh think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting i think that could give it a really well we'll see how it goes i may just be flat painting over it uh well of course that's the other advantage of paint if you don't like it all you do is put on another coat yep i guess we'd better go because our time looks like it's about up yep i i need to go to the dentist so it's was nice talking to you Kathleen um bye-bye okay bye-bye thank you  what do you think about the benefits in jobs um i'm i'm relatively relatively satisfied with the benefits i have i think that um our health insurance is terribly expensive uh-huh i'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money but um you know that's that's my major complaint i guess what about you yeah and a lot of times they turn down your claims so that leaves you paying for all of it uh-huh or or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't uh-huh yeah yeah i right the the health insurance i have is MetLife and if it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then uh you just pay ten dollars and then uh the insurance pays the rest of the bill or if you go outside you get uh seventy thirty i see now we i have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered but what i found recently is what they've been doing is they they poll somehow the area and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code uh-huh and so recently when when we had a claim um they didn't pay the eighty five percent they paid much lower and when i called they said oh well that's because your doctor is charging much more than the norm for the area and i was really surprised because either there aren't that many of that type of doctor within that zip code so that you know two doctors could balance each other out or their you know their statistics aren't very accurate right and and they're probably doing it to their benefit anyway so yeah i would assume that you know whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in uh-huh but it's it's difficult What about other other benefits are there others that you're dissatisfied with well i work for Sears and and um that's about the the only real benefit you have is health insurance well you have vacation i mean yeah yeah but everybody gets vacation i mean like uh TI and some other places you know they have social recreational facilities and they have a driving range and weight room and you know i think they even have a swimming pool and huh i don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that yeah i'm not familiar with that sort of thing but but you know to me vacation is is an issue and i mean different places have different amounts of vacation i would assume uh-huh right and um you know the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay perhaps or um um i don't know i suppose um sick days some places count the number of hours and some places just sort of believe you uh-huh um ours is based on number of days and you know people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill right right but um otherwise i'm not not aware of any problems with the benefits around here so maybe that covers the topic then yeah well i don't know the working the working conditions you know if you could include that in benefits some places aren't very safe to work uh-huh and and some places don't compensate you for the hazards that you that you have to work under uh-huh or maybe a benefit uh not really a benefit either but would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls right uh-huh um um but you know i suppose some places are are more stringent about that than others yeah i think so and and maybe arriving late or something like that you know how how they enforce the rules uh-huh but other than that i don't have much feeling for for the benefits since like i said um i don't have a big problem with with them i um Workmen Workmen's Comp is a big thing now in in Texas because um um how much it costs the employers and a a lot of them are going to their own insurance now uh-huh and it reduces some of the length of the benefits and uh and i don't know besides that but i i noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing oh i i didn't know that somebody could avoid Workmen's Compensation well well they still have to pay it but they buy their own instead of going through the state oh i see so apparently it costs less that way uh-huh uh-huh i suppose that whenever companies can avoid um benefits it's to the to to the benefit of the company uh-huh and at least you know financially in the short run but i would think they would get a much greater turnover and that people would be dissatisfied working for them yeah that's what i what i think they they should be able they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are and how much profit they're making instead of trying to cut everything down and then have everybody be unhappy and and have a constant turnover of people right i mean sure the payroll is lower that way but i would assume that the productivity is way down also yeah the productivity and the training costs if they have to train the same employee a new employee every six months then i don't see how they can save money uh-huh uh-huh you know and once they once they get somebody good they ought to hang onto them that's right no i agree yeah okay it was nice talking to you well thank you for calling bye-bye yeah bye-bye  uh all right i had to register us in there okay uh hopefully you're a basketball fan excuse me hopefully you're a basketball fan yeah i'm from Indiana great i'm glad you are i'm not i i i could care about any of it you know but go ahead i i would like to talk about uh maybe college basketball i i like to see it uh be more of an amateur sport i'd like to see it turn back to like the Southwest Conference down here i would like to see Texas and all the teams uh since we're supposed to talk about specific teams i would like to see them turn back to where the college player plays for four years and they're not they're not semi pro and just go on and are stolen by the the NBA the the League you know in three years plus i'd like to see them to be true athletes where they're they're taking a regular um-hum college course you know i'd like to see they didn't ask that but they're talking about college teams i you know since you're being you can talk for hours go ahead you you you if you like sports go right ahead with this one yeah yeah um well i know like what you just said um Purdue had to had to uh their best player this years you know averaged twenty points a game they had to make him sit the bench and actually kicked him off the team because um yeah his uh grades even though they passed Big Ten standings and they passed you know NC double A they weren't they did not pass um Purdue requirements and so now that's surprising that they uh that they have better requirements that's good yeah that's what i like to see go ahead i'm all for that and see so he was treated like all the rest of students you know that's great and and so um you know their very best player they probably lost over half their games because you know by twenty twenty points was what he averaged um and so you know he had to sit you know he was kicked off the team and then they've got three players top you know recruiting class this year that are going to have to be well the the prep school they go to before they can play because they aren't smart enough you know it's just sad because i mean Purdue even though they're one of the few schools that really uh oh yeah stress academics they're really suffering you know and oh i i agree i i think that that there's a lot of inconsistencies uh uh when some conference uh players come from outside of Texas you know and and play us here uh they're obviously plus practicing sixty hours a week you know and and there's no consistency seems to me um-hum that like Purdue uh uh when they're trying a student athlete is spending so many hours in class he only has twenty twenty five whatever hours he has to spend on practice he should be playing they all should be playing another team that that has about twenty hours to practice a week but uh you there are teams that practices sixty hours a week they're not going to class at all yeah like i mean that's that's what i mean by semi pro there's too many semi pros in college and and i think they ought to get rid of that yeah that's what happened to this guy i mean he was uh he didn't go to class and so they just said you know you can't make the grades you're going to have to see you later well i'm all for i'm all for the oh baseball has a uh a uh minor league system and i think that the football and basketball they asked us to talk about basketball should you know let let them go have a semi pro team but i think i'd like to see college athletes let's talk about college basketball i like i like that if any basketball that i like i like that i i don't i don't like the pros at all yeah i don't either it's uh the high scoring there's no defense it seems like and they just kind of score a hundred and twenty five points you know the other team scores hundred twenty two you know and i don't really uh get much out of that yeah um yeah it is fun to watch some real disciplined teams play in a in college um-hum and i saw Princeton i think it was or Harvard play this year and they're they're like all white and their starting guard had SAT scores of fifteen hundred oh it did um-hum um-hum and it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams because it was like they played so much smarter and more disciplined i don't know if they won very many games but yeah i don't know their style of play was so much different from some of the teams that just run and gun yeah yeah i like high school football which again again is is not the subject but that's so much fun to watch because they're they're the the pure amateurs you know and there's no money involved you go to college you don't really know it it loses it somewhere yeah yeah uh whatever sport it is if they're really putting putting a lot of money in these players let's face it ninety percent are being paid so i'd like to see college basketball and all the other sports go back to being amateurs i i don't care about seeing the best players in the world play i like to see uh the people going to Texas just play and the ones that are in class and and like to see athletes uh yeah uh or students students fellow students like myself you know to to play the game i i in fact i like amateur sports i i don't i don't see it has to be i don't think that college football football and or or basketball should have to be semi pro you know yeah yeah it's i wish it'd return to the to good old days of the amateur and everybody play that's what i like everybody should play you know i'm kind of racist i guess when i say uh i like to see the white guys do well you know instead of the run and gun all the time yeah well again i'd just like to see the the true athlete the student true true true student athlete play basketball you know i don't like to see the ones that aren't have no intention of going to class uh yeah yeah you know and again just picking a school uh Texas uh is is usually not the best team you know because the other teams are i'm sure practice a lot more and uh SMU down here in fact in in footballs been trying to get back uh to having true student student student athletes and and that's what i think is a lot of fun there's just so much pressure on the schools i think to win though you know that to win and get and money yeah yeah and you know if it's like if they don't win they don't get any money so it's and and the school suffers um-hum which is kind of bad but that's just how it always is yeah i always thought that college university was to to for an education and then sports sports of course is part of the education i don't think that sports has to make a lot of money or you do away with it i don't know why they don't keep fencing and all that you know and yeah and and they seem to be there's articles in the Time magazine and all that about whether it be basketball or anything else if it's not making money then we'll do away with it well that's that's not i thought it was you know so that you give them an education of that particular discipline yeah and i and i i just think that amateur sports should stay in universities that's where it's at and i i'm sure saddened to see i think it was Wisconsin or somewhere they were getting rid of fencing and a couple of other things i don't know what it was and it just seems so sad to have to only rely on really you know college football is that all they're going to have to make money you know plus i didn't think that was the objective was to make money but it seems like it is yeah huh it really is i know there's a lot of pressure on schools to have a winning program yeah um-hum to get the best athletes so they can keep their seats full um-hum you went to Indiana University University oh Purdue okay uh Purdue yeah well good uh you're you're a TIer up in Sherman oh very good so uh-huh are you from Dallas area yeah yeah i'm in the facilities down here down here in Dallas yeah i guess football is the big sport down here isn't it uh certainly high school football and college football but again high high school football uh is just so much fun to watch because uh uh uh you know just not everybody plays of course but they're still uh it's good and it's still you know the kids and there's absolutely no money involved whatsoever and you know they're going to class you know yeah you heard of Damon it it's just real amateur sports have you heard of Damon Bailey hum-um the IU uh white guard that plays well last year when he was in high school uh hum-um they drew a crowd of like forty one thousand for the state finals when he played is that right that's uh i never has been in a basketball uh football game in high school that had that many yeah yeah so that's uh i mean that's pretty big like he's from Indiana and he plays for Indiana now um-hum and uh Indiana State seems to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there the Pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd but you know the college the high school games i mean that seems seems to be the big attraction and college well my office mate here Earl he he goes to all the Maverick games and he loves that he he would be this would be great question for him uh to talk about basketball like he's got i'm looking at his calendar he's got all over the place uh and he goes to a lot of the Maverick games and everything and but i i i can't get interested at all zero i i listen to him and occasionally i'll watch them on channel eleven but uh gee i can't uh more than five minutes of a basketball game just seems about that's it of uh uh pro anyway uh of yeah seems like you could set the st the score at a hundred and then give them five minutes to play and then it'd be the same result you know because they they start they shoot so much and then the last yeah yeah what five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner i guess um-hum yeah i'm surprised a little bit when you're talking about basketball how some players work and Mavericks had oh two players this year that they got rid of last year i'll think of them in a minute Perkins Sam Perkins can't think of the other one they're both Tarpley is he one Tarpley pardon me yeah Tarpley and they both left this past year and both of them were on were on play-off teams uh so they they benefitted tremendously by by leaving the Mavericks yeah and Sam Perkins here uh he's one guy i did follow from think he was in Virginia i can't think of what school he went to but from i guess he's been here about five six seven years in the pros and he was he never quite achieved the you know the super stardom that he had in in in college but uh uh-huh basketball they have a nice i don't know if you've been down to the sports for Reunion Arena it's really a nice uh certainly the  all right Rob what do you think about uh choosing choosing a college yeah what should i tell my parents huh yeah not being a parent but being a student uh i guess i'd say there's there's a lot of things yeah uh i think they need to provide a lot of guidance during high school right preparing them for the college they want to go to and then it's a trade-off between what you know what you got to find out what a kid wants out of college you know is it uh a a social thing or is he looking to make big bucks later with a with a name brand college so to speak uh-huh things like you know do you go to S M U you want to spend all that money and get that name or do you you know you you just kind of wasting your time to spend all that money if you're not going to use the degree for something yeah do you think a child in high school could know what they want in a college i don't think in high school you know but i think that's when you should start being exposed to the ideas and start asking some questions uh-huh having the having you know somebody that's been to college needs to sit down and explain these things to you you know i went in not knowing anything and if i'd a had a little better idea what was going on i'd a probably made a lot of decisions differently in what way oh i'd probably started sooner and taken courses in high school that would have prepared me better for for what i was going to see yeah would you have uh went to the name college or probably not in my situation i don't have the money for it but uh yeah then again it's kind of hard to say where i would have gone had i been thinking about it back in high school yeah so uh i think i don't know to me college was a was a i knew nothing about what it was going to be like it's it's a whole different thing than high school you know just go up and show up and stay up all day yeah and you know they tell you what to do and you do it it's kind of a you drop in a couple times a week and it's up to you to to learn it and get it done right so i think those are the kinds of things that parents should should let their kids know if they know themselves yeah college is a whole different ball game yeah did either of your parents go to college no yeah neither did mine so i wasn't really didn't know what to expect so uh so yeah yeah it sounds like uh like you said sometimes the the name colleges the the large major universities carry the big name and uh if they're private you know like a Harvard or something they're big bucks sometimes fortunately though uh some of the big name schools are in state right and they're state universities like uh Michigan or you know Purdue or something like that and you can get uh a good education at a good cost you know if if you're in state decent price yeah but if you know if your kids are out uh uh they want to go to college out of state you know you have to look like you said is the are you are they going to get the education that's going to balance out like here in Sherman there's Austin College and i'm from up north i never heard of Austin College but it's well respected in this area it's private it's very expensive and just talking to people that go there it is uh you know you you know the professors on a first name basis you go over their house quite often and eat and spend time with them and at the major universities you just don't do that yeah that's you know there's thirty thousand people there and there's couple hundred people in each of your class and and i remember one professor wanted to have people over but people were you know just kind of scared to go over and are they going to be called brownnoser when uh so it's just sort of unaccepted you just kind right go to class and you don't usually use the office hours i mean there's not the the relationship you get the degree with the big name on it but you know you don't build that there's a lot of learning that you don't get right as opposed to that's what i like about Austin College i didn't know that because i'd never been around any small colleges but uh but there again like you said the big name the big bucks you know you can go anywhere with a that a degree from Stanford you know and people turn heads but you know a degree from Austin College or something you know where's that well you know it's not really well known and unfortunately sometimes that has to do with their sports program you know right right if uh you know well some schools maybe not like U N L V you know people kind of think that's a joke you know and you know it's big name and everybody knows about it and everybody wears U N L V shirts but you know what kind of education are these people getting but you know some of the other schools like uh you know North Carolina and Duke you know while they're successful in like basketball i mean people know that they're really good in academics right a lot of the schools i think i think i don't know for sure but i think the schools up in the northern states are generally provide a better education i could be wrong about that but my experience with Texas schools has not been all that great yeah yeah i've never been to school down here so i really don't know uh i guess there again i mean there's the good and the bad like um yeah there seem to be a lot of junior colleges and community colleges down here and up north there aren't i mean pretty much you either go to a technical school out of if you go to further schooling you go to like a technical school like a DeVry or something like that right or you go to a university or a major college there are no there as far as i know there are very few
