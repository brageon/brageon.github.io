 okay lead on um drug testing doesn't bother me doesn't bother you no uh i've been drug tested twice at TI and it doesn't bother me uh well we differ there it bothers me why why does it bother you i just feel like it's an invasion invasion of my privacy you know i you know there's a lot alcohol for example i can go out and drink on the weekends and come in hung over and do a lot worse job than if i go out on Friday and i don't know say take take a hit of Ecstasy and dance all night not saying that i do but i'm just i know i understand uh i think alcohol's a a whole lot worse drug and it's more widely accepted well that's true i i agree that there should be something done about people that drink alcohol because i'm sure that there's people that drink and come to work especially on a second shift or third shift so uh i agree with you there but it just uh and it and it probably is an invasion of privacy i i feel like it's okay if there's if there's cause somebody's performance is you know indicates indicates that they're they're obviously not all there they're do yeah okay you know you got reason to suspect they may be doing drugs and he says sure you know take them down there and test them but i think a lot of people are going to go out and you know substitute something else for maybe what they would have done a lot of people i don't i personally don't smoke pot but a lot of people do and they do it in their own time at their at their at their own place and they're going to find they're going to go out and drink instead because they know that it's their job on the line that's true and uh you know i've been i've come to work hung in the morning and i know i'm worthless feel bad yeah i don't drink anymore but i can remember but i can remember the you know there's nothing worse than a hangover i have to agree there nothing worse than a i can remember staying in bed a whole day from a hangover and not going to work but i that was years ago and i didn't work for TI so but you you know really and truly there's there's nothing worse than a hangover and you're right and you cannot perform well and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you that's true but there's i think there's a there's a big difference between use and abuse and i do do agree that drug abuse should be punished but if somebody's going to in their own home on their own time in such a way that doesn't interfere interfere with their responsibilities you know do it do some drugs then that should be their business course through this i think that they've helped a lot of people also uh a lot of people have ended up going uh to treatment you know which is offered i think at most government places i know it is at TI do you work for TI yeah yeah i do okay well you know a lot of people have used that treatment and i center and that's probably been a good thing especially for cocaine abusers and stuff i think i think that's true and i think that the key thing is the difference between use and abuse and a lot of people don't they they don't know how to use drugs for recreational purposes without it becoming you know a dominant force in their life the drug can use you i mean yeah it's it's you know it's easy for me to say i'm going to go out on Friday night and maybe you know i don't have to work till Monday and if i want to go out and and drink a little beer or do something and just dance a lot or whatever that's fine as long as i realize Saturday that in order to you know i'm going to feel like crap that's just the way it is same thing if you drink but the thing is you don't get up and drink another beer to get over it yeah and and unfortunately and i think cocaine's a a good example it's it's just so much easier to just do some more do some more and then before you know it you know you're you're always doing it yeah i don't know that's true that's true yep well i mean i i work for TI so i don't do drugs you know you can't i mean it and you just run the risk of right it's too big a risk yeah of of getting caught and of course the first time you get caught it's not that big a deal you have to go to treatment and that but you're without a paycheck during that time and i don't at least that's my understanding is even you know the first time you go for counseling and it's six weeks before you're back to work oh i didn't know they took you off the job i was that i was told that uh somebody had uh some woman had had a cold or something and had some cough medicine prescribed and her husband or maybe the other way around one of them anyway had uh come down with the same thing and used some of the medicine and was tested the next day and failed and was out of a job until he went through counseling and it's like you know i can't afford that kind of loss of income you know wow who can afford that my God i can't afford to miss a day let alone six i mean i've always been yeah the first time so what i'll go explain myself and and now i would have thought if he'd have brought in the prescription wife prescription and explained the situation that they might have let him off of that that's what you would think but i kind of i that's i you know i heard it through the grapevine so i don't i don't know firsthand but that's what i heard was that it was just they didn't okay yeah you know there there were no now see that i wouldn't agree with see see i think you got to be able to bend the rules a little bit here and there too without you know if if it's a case like that because look how many people take their husband's or their wife's medication you know but that's a really good example oh yeah you know you've got the same exact thing yeah yeah yeah and so i would think that either the doctor could get him off with that or or that they should listen i mean because i i just can't see that they would do some make somebody go to a rehab or whatever they go through because he took his wife's medicine that just doesn't sound right does it so it seems like they should be able to bend the rules oops excuse me a little bit on that but you but i don't know because i don't know anybody that's had to go through treatment or anything so i really don't know well i think i don't know anybody personally either you know i do know a lot of people that you know do use drugs recrela recreationally and there's such a big difference yeah i i don't know it's it's kind of i've also been you know known managers at TI i know one i guess i shouldn't make that a plural but uh who drank on the job had whiskey in his desk drawer and you tell me what's worse ooh you know oh that could have been his whole career down the tubes yeah but everybody covers up you know it's the good old boy thing i don't know so does alcohol show up in these tests i don't think so they don't test for it i mean so so it wouldn't show up yeah well it's not that's true see there's the there it is right there it's not illegal it's not illegal and drugs are illegal so i guess if they made drugs legal or marijuana legal then we the we wouldn't be going through this you know they wouldn't be testing which doesn't make any sense either because they say you know it has no place on the job and you can't work safely under the influence of drugs and stuff like that well that's true and so if it was made legal that doesn't make it any safer on the job no no i agree i think i believe in test for cause if if somebody's performance and i guess that there's the other argument is that well do you wait until they screw up you know and someone gets hurt get hurt yeah yeah but at the same time you know you're telling me that on some given day i'm going to walk in they're going to tell me go down and you know and go down to the health center and you know pee in a jar or whatever it is no i haven't and so have you had to do it yet oh gosh i was one of the first ones to go i think the with the January that they started it up i got called so i was one of the first ones but but you did you get tested when you got hired no see i was i've been working for TI for almost eight years okay so you were well i i got tested before i got hired too so but hum i have to i have to honestly say that i drink more now than i did because you know it's what i can get away with and if i'm going to go on the weekends spend my money and you know i if you don't drink you know you used to drink okay you go out and you want to party and that's that's something you do when you're young and dumb i guess you know i'm not young anymore i'm not as young as i used to be but i'm still i quit i quit drinking at oh a long time ago quit drinking i didn't smoke i don't smoke i gave everything up so i guess i don't know what just old age i guess is why i no i don't smoke i quit doing that and i've tried to quit drinking but it's the only thing left you know i quit doing drugs when TI said quit and it was no big deal you know it's like i wasn't a regular drug user but uh oh i have a lot of friends that just are uh smoke just you know occasional joint at a party or something you know and and i'm even afraid to be around it i i understand because i'm afraid what if it gets you know because you can inhale it if if you're if a room full of it i understand i was around somebody today outdoors and they're smoking and it's like you know i smell it and i'm like well is this going into my bloodstream you know is this is there going to be enough there to get me into my bloodstream yeah and with my luck there'd be the notice Monday you know go take your test and that would scare me get me in trouble so see it didn't use to bother me when i thought that you know if i come in there and they say okay you tested positive now explain yourself and i could say yeah well i was around some people that were smoking pot but i wasn't but you know it's the idea that how can you prove it you can't but at least you've got a chance whereas if they say for six weeks you don't have a job because you tested positive that you know that's that's devastating how you know i can't live without my income for six weeks there's no way no not many people could i go paycheck to paycheck barely exactly so so i don't know well this has been interesting yeah opposing viewpoints there but huh i said opposing viewpoints sort well sort of i mean i i agree with a lot of what you said for the most part so what kind of music do you like i like all kinds of music actually yeah that's same here i'm kind of partial to country western i like that do you and i like mood music like you know when i'm in the mood for that i like semi-classical yeah the real classics i'm not as familiar with as you know the ordinary sounds that you hear every day type of thing uh-huh yeah that's about that's about all i listen to is the classical stuff we have a we have a really good classical radio station here uh-huh it's uh gets no money from the state or the feds or anybody it's uh one hundred percent listener supported oh huh and it's a twenty four hour station oh that's fantastic yeah they they get a lot of support here well we have a similar um radio station here and because of the uh people i guess being pressured to have advertisers you know a lot of the stations have to have advertisers they kind of like uh-huh compromised and they do some of it at like certain hours but it's not always at a time when you can you know sit down and listen to it so uh-huh you you kind of get trapped into listening to whatever there is available type of thing you know yeah yeah that's the good thing about them they do no advertising that's it's really nice just music uh-huh we have that on TV we have two public uh broadcasting systems uh channel two and thirty six also that are publicly supported and they have excellent programming yeah i like i like PBS yeah yep same thing uh PBS here you can't get it unless you have cable uh-huh and that really upsets me because i won't pay cable prices because there's it's it's useless having cable i think it is it's expensive it's uh it's far too expensive and they don't have anything on there no and the the problem is that they can do it at will you know like up the prices and you're if you have it you just have to pay it yeah exactly you know that's the hard part i've almost given in a couple of times and gotten it every time i get one of those special offers in the mail but yeah uh-huh i've avoided the temptation so far but i sure do miss PBS yeah because they they have lots of good stuff Masterpiece Theatre and mystery and nature yep see we have cable here yeah and almost everyone here has cable and it it's uh it's good because you don't need the outside antennas with your TV and stuff and it gives you a lot more um yeah of the other you know of the widest uh uh television that's available to you um-hum yeah i i had cable before i uh came up here and i miss some of it i mean we had pretty good cable where i was but i miss Discovery Channel and A&E and CNN uh-huh yeah that's what i like yep right and i love that you know i'm having CNN withdrawal pains uh-huh do you go to the theatre for for music uh every once in a while um have you been to the opera ever uh occasionally down in Charlotte yeah oh that's nice yeah it it's it's pretty good i've seen Man of La Mancha and uh a few of those you know that in Boston and uh i enjoyed it thoroughly i really did um yeah i've seen a few musicals and i uh go to Atlantic City once in a while and i always like to catch some shows when i'm there um-hum especially like when they have special singers and things and La Cage au Faux that was excellent yeah yeah i been into Boston a few times uh i was there last year during the Fourth of July thing and went out to the um uh-huh Esplanade and listened to the Boston Pops and oh wow well we're only about two hours from there yeah they're good they're really oh really yeah i Boston's okay i mean i wouldn't want to live there but it's a nice place to visit no right in fact i yeah it's crowded i know that sure is it's murder driving in that place isn't it awful yeah and i always get stuck in the in the afternoon traffic oh yeah i i think that the commute to to and from work has to be the worst horror show because even the breakdown lane is used for a passing you know a travel lane in the morning um-hum and that's really i think that's a very serious thing you know i'm surprised they haven't had more you know really fatal accidents out there doing that well i tell you the way people are driving nowadays i'm surprised we're not killing more people than we are oh i know it's true it's true seems like drivers are getting worse and worse every year so what are you majoring in um human factors oh and and what is that that's um well it's sort of difficult to explain it's it's industrial engineering and you look at applications and things from the human from the human factor standpoint how does it interface with the person using it oh oh i see and and yeah we had someone from uh do some ergonomics in our area do you do yeah it that's very similar cover some of that yeah yeah very similar um uh specializing in the computer and you know uh interfacing with computers and software and all that kind of good stuff oh oh oh oh well then this is right up your alley what they're trying yeah this is uh sort of the same sort of thing that's why it's it was the uh professor who brought this thing in he'd gone to a conference yeah yeah uh-huh down there and brought this thing up i yeah sure i'll do it yeah why not really hey if TI wants to give me five bucks a phone call that's okay sure sure you have to talk to all kinds of neat people all over the place yeah it's true it is in in fact i have a friend of mine that moved to North Carolina she's um an emergency room nurse she does the operating room um-hum and uh she's been down there a couple years and she really loves it where's she at i don't know the city yeah there's all i know is it's down in in North Carolina in fact the last time she was up i meant to ask her you know what city she was in i didn't but she said it's really nice yeah there's not too many not too many big ones around here no uh matter fact we don't have any big ones after you know after being used to places like Boston and Atlanta you come here and you know they people think Charlotte is the big town you know yeah oh wow and it's small really yeah what's the population uh Charlotte oh what about quarter of a million oh that's that's pretty good size though oh it's fairly good size i mean it's it's not it's not small but it's certainly small by Atlanta standards yeah yeah yeah course everything's small consider compared to Atlanta i i liked Atlanta too i have a sister-in-law that lives in Atlanta yeah my my brother and uh sister-in-law live there i like they she uh she in fact went from Massachusetts to uh Florida then to Atlanta and she really really likes it yeah Atlanta's Atlanta's a good city it really is uh you have to get used to that cotton picking traffic on two eighty five yeah but uh if you if you miss it at the right time of the day then you're okay yeah yeah but it always seemed like when i was there i was always finishing i lived in Duluth which is uh north of Atlanta well not north it's more east uh-huh uh along I eighty five um-hum and i would always be on the other end of two eighty five having to go all the way around two eighty five and then onto eighty five to go home and it was always at the end of the day oh yeah i never managed to plan my departure right the airport's something down there oh yeah oh my God i i swear those planes going or coming going or coming yeah yeah it's scary it is it's um it's scary they they rival even uh Chicago on uh departure and arrival uh number of arrivals every day yes unbelievable in fact when we went down to visit one time we just sat there and we watched i couldn't believe yeah oh it's a busy it's a busy place and they have amazingly few accidents there the traffic it is i know isn't it amazingly few unreal because uh i mean if you're flying anywhere down here you always go through Atlanta you can't avoid it uh-huh it's the hub city yep yep and uh God i went there to to visit the Underground when that was you know the Underground City um-hum yeah and i thought that was really neat yeah that's super it's getting even better too that amazing oh really yeah they they just they never stop doing things to it is that right all kinds of good stuff go course i haven't been there in about uh eight years yeah last well see i left there in uh eighty so what was it eighty six yeah so it's been it's been five years for me five years the the growth in that place is phenomenal yeah it just doesn't stop they don't stand still that's for sure i mean it we're having our problems out this way with the banking crisis and yeah credit unions and all that kind of good stuff yeah yeah and it's starting to effect you know the economy sure because of uh the uh businesses that have their money tied up yeah exactly every place you go you know the couple of years ago i was thinking about moving to Massachusetts but uh boy i'm glad i didn't uh-huh yeah yeah because it's really going downhill up there it has i don't know what they're going to have to do to boost it but they need to do something quick well you know i i was when when the big boom was going on i was thinking well Dukakis must be an absolute genius yeah and then i i i really think that all of that was just you know temporary growth and everything to make him look good for the Presidential election yeah because it certainly wasn't sustained sometimes i wonder though if the presidential election isn't what really did everything in because he wasn't really paying attention to business you know you can't do both things well well yeah but on the other hand if it if it needed his personal intervention all the time then it wasn't a good system anyway no true but uh you know it should it should have been rolling right along without him yeah you know good a good chief executive would be able to sit back and not do anything that's true yep that's true hopefully yeah somebody has to watch the store though you can't really you know without overseeing no that's true and and and Lord knows with that legislature up there they probably did all kinds of things while he wasn't looking sure sure so look at what happened just in Washington alone God yeah well you can 't it's mind boggling you can't trust legislators anyway no well it's been interesting talking to you yeah we need we didn't talk too much about music but we had a good conversation but oh yeah right i hope to hear so what kind of garden do you have uh we have a vegetable garden with a we have some onions potatoes uh broccoli spinach lettuce radishes oh um well that's nice nice little garden yeah we he plant we plant quite a bit and we have the you know peach tree and a plum tree and so oh do you get get a good crop of plums uh well we just planted the plum tree this year so we haven't uh haven't gotten anything off of that hopefully this will be the first year for our peaches we're hoping to get something off of that so oh hadn't gotten any um yeah um yeah sounds nice i used it we we had some wild plum trees growing in a field when i was a near my house when i was a kid we used to go out there and raid it oh uh-huh that's great love plums yeah we uh i i love plums and peach i just love all fruit you know yeah and it's hard to come you know the i don't know the fruit we get down here at the store has just been pretty lousy lately so yeah it's like yeah it's same around here too makes you wonder what they're what they're sending out i mean yeah where is it yeah like where does all the good stuff go yeah where is it i know they have to grow some of it because certainly they're not using it for juices and stuff i mean they use the junk for that it makes me wonder gosh if they're using junk for that what are we getting here uh-huh yeah what are we yeah yeah hat's in the juice this is what i would put in juice oh really yeah i i've gotten to where i won't even buy juices anymore because i'm afraid of what's in there uh-huh that's so true yeah well i don't do very much gardening i i would like to but i just don't have the time to do it or keep it up right i i try to get into some flowers and stuff i just uh-huh yeah uh-huh placed an order again for some bulbs and waiting for those to show up and uh-huh yeah we got some bulbs but we haven't gotten them planted uh my husband's uh been growing uh lots of flowers from seed and um-hum all of his own plants under a a light he put out in the garage to help keep them you know alive and get them a good start so we hope we have a lot of flowers this year so um-hum um-hum well i started yeah i started some about uh about a month ago and had them in little planters all over the house and my cats got to them and that was the end of them uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah we don't have any pets so yeah these these two cats it's hard to keep anything around yeah like my husband says we just have two kids it's hard to keep them out of things let alone pets yeah really these these these cats are just about as bad as kids i've got one that can even open the cupboard doors and get in inside the cabinets oh no that's no fun yeah she's yeah she's got it wired now she jumps up on the counter and stands up reaches up for the door and pulls on it till it opens and then jumps up in there uh-huh oh you ought to you ought to send a videotape that and send it into America's Home Videos yeah i know i i've been seeing all these weird things they send in and uh i says gee i ought to get that that's right you you know that could be worth ten thousand dollars so um you never know kitty cat what do you think about being a star i'll buy you buy you lots of cat food with that that's right yeah that's right you can buy lots of cat food with that so or hire somebody to do your lawn so then you don't have to worry about it we have a big problem around here with insect problems you know fire ants and yeah you believe that oh yeah yeah so that's it gets expensive around here to do a lawn because you're always you know buying the fertilizer and the you know the bug killers and weed killers yeah yeah and all that stuff well i'm i'm pretty easy as far as yard work i'll go out there and cut it and i'll edge it if it dies it dies uh-huh uh-huh oh my husband just has to have it green has to be green it's no i uh i'll take my chances with it course now where i where i'm at now i don't have to worry about the lawn because they got somebody that comes in and does it oh that's nice it is nice he matter of fact he was here today it was the first really warm weather we've had and he came out and cut the yard and trimmed the hedges and all that uh-huh yeah well we had a real warm day today and all the neighbors were out you know in their front yards doing their yard and yeah i guess i i guess we're really into spring now it's a perfect day for it yeah i i love spring i just love it i don't i like winter yeah i like i like cold dreary weather do you oh not me oh i don't i i grew up in Wyoming and it's cold enough there for me so yeah i it it's hum-um no i gosh i got use to it when i lived in South Dakota uh-huh it's just great up there oh do you have a lot of that kind of weather there in North Carolina no this is another one of those winters that wasn't oh winter that wasn't huh yeah it's i don't know i was expecting snow and all of that i maybe i should have moved over to the mountains instead of here but uh they didn't get a lot of snow in the mountains either uh-huh yeah no talking to my folks in Wyoming they uh they were still hoping they get some more because if they don't they're going to have water problems this summer so yeah yeah that was a big problem was i was in South Dakota course we'd had plenty of snow but uh every once in a while they they get shorted on the snow and the water supply starts drying up uh-huh that's right they need the the snow for the water so because those i mean those those summers up there are brutal uh-huh terrible you get those uh Chinook winds coming across the prairies and golly it's uh it's unbelievable the extremes in weather up there but i enjoy it gosh i and just dries everything out uh-huh i i hadn't been anywhere where the weather was so tremendously great for me oh well it sounds like you need to move back there yeah i i've been thinking about it only problem is i i would be very limited in any job opportunities out there yeah that's that's it we'd like to be closer to family but limits the job your welcome Brittany yeah yeah the uh i mean there's still basically ranchers and farmers up there you know yeah but it's hard to make it being a rancher or farmer yeah i what Brittany okay good hunting that's all right that's just another one wanting to get in on the conversation oh yeah she she was wanting oh i meant to ask you can you hear me okay on this thing okay good it's a it's a it's a headset so it makes it a little easier uh-huh yeah i hear you just fine oh yeah You doing lots of these calls you work for TI oh oh okay my husband works for T I oh no i don't i'm a i'm a student uh oh oh okay my just about everybody i've talked to has been with TI i guess that's i guess that's the same with your husband uh-huh yeah he works for them right now he's been there almost six years now yeah i had a i had an interesting call about uh two weeks ago um came in late too it was like eleven thirty at night and i answered it and oh wow i said yeah well you know i'm not doing anything so i took it and the subject was discuss the weather and find out how your weather compares to the caller's weather i had one of those too it was a weather phone call yeah well the interesting thing was this was from another student at state right across town from me oh oh well you really kind of have the same kind of weather i mean yeah gosh what's you weather like you know well i don't know let me look out my window yeah it's kind of foggy tonight i had one from somebody that was up in New York and they were out of their house because of the ice storm yeah they were living with families that would take them in and oh that ice storm yeah yeah i talked to somebody about two weeks ago from Rochester and same story they uh they really had a lot of damage from uh ice and all that uh-huh yeah yeah they couldn't even be in the house because they had no power and everything yeah yeah that's pretty bad yeah and here we were i mean i talked to her we had just gotten over a ninety four degree day so we really had a lot to compare so oh oh sounds like that young one wants some attention oh i she's talking to my husband i think so yeah so oh oh that's okay yeah Rochester's a nice town too they they said that they had had uh lots of pretty little parks and stuff up there that just been wiped out oh yeah that's what she said they they were going to have the governor was going to try to have it declared a disaster area that's too bad because i yeah yeah that's too bad because i i i had a an old an ex-professor who uh is up there in Rochester and he told me about how much they had worked to beautify the place uh-huh and all these beautiful gardens and parks and all that good stuff now it's all been wiped out it's a shame oh yeah it really is oh well such is life yeah it seems like you work hard and something else goes wrong nothing's forever i guess yeah exactly it's like me with gardens i can go out there and plant a garden and then watch the bugs and oh that's what it is with us too you just like get so frustrated you get something about ready ripe and there goes the bugs and uh-huh you get a get a frost or something hail that's even better uh-huh or hail yeah it just you know yeah my the only the only thing i ever accomplished i i mean i've had gardens for a long long time when i was a kid i started uh i had some squash and tomatoes and watermelons uh-huh and i grew a thirty four and a half pound watermelon yeah absolutely tasteless had no taste whatsoever uh-huh oh my word oh was it we trew grew cantaloupe last year and that's how they were just tasteless you couldn't even eat them uh-huh cantaloupe's difficult to grow and get taste out of them i mean they're they're easy enough they'll grow easy enough but you can't get any flavor yeah uh-huh yeah yeah you have to be so careful when you buy at the stores yeah i i buy them every once in a while and and i bought one and it was you know blah uh-huh and then i said well i'll try another one so this is several weeks later and i bought another one and it was just as sweet and wonderful but you never know uh-huh yeah nope you don't it's hard to pick them uh-huh it's like oranges and everything else but anyway oh yeah the oranges here look disgusting so oh yeah they look terrible here i look at those thing i say i wouldn't buy them not even to squeeze for orange juice uh so uh-huh yeah they're all okay i guess we're on the air now right uh i haven't had too much experience with uh judges and jurors i've uh served on a jury one time and uh i think one of my concerns after that experience was uh finding that there tend to be people in the jury that can't bring themselves to sentence someone yes i i have my primary experience has been as uh an expert witness and and uh and two murder trials um and uh in each case it was a retrial and the sentencing was the same each time which happened in the state of Florida happened to be uh death but in terms of i well the question also was in terms of mandatory sentencing or mandatory sentences for uh certain crimes i think depending on uh in certain crimes i think that they should be mandatory for example uh armed robbery uh if we have convicted i think uh plea bargaining should should be uh a thing of the past um certain types of uh you know homicides yeah i'm inclined to agree you do need a uh fixed and clear sentence there yes in in homicides related to other than i guess what are called uh crimes of passion uh for example you know as you as you very well know the great majority of homicides are people murdering other people they know mostly people they know yeah so in those instances uh that's uh i think that there is some leeway there what was is interesting in this regard is the recent case in New Hampshire yes uh the schoolteacher um-hum and the life sentence uh she received yeah i think that was a logical decision there yes and it came very quickly surprisingly um-hum uh i guess it was uh they brought in their verdict and sentence at the same time did they not well well yeah i think they went back for a brief hearing on the sentence um-hum uh but that was that was fairly quick i think that is something that we need in this country i know the last time i was down in the Caribbean uh we had visited the island of uh Saint Thomas which is American and there were twenty three unsolved murders and nobody seem to be concerned about it um at the same time there was one unsolved murder on the island of Tortola and the whole island wanted to know when the hanging was going to take place well in answer to you know answer to the question though i still think the sentencing should be in the hands of the jury even though as you say there are some uh people who are reluctant i do not think again in the matter of uh uh that that judges should have the uh the upper hand or the only hand in that sense because i think if but i i've never served on a jury you probably know this better than i um if the jury does their job and of course there are those on the jury that do not i'm sure but and ask the questions and uh correctly and then one of things i've always wondered is uh the ability of jurors to to ask questions i've never uh really been sure that a juror is entitled to ask a question well that that that and that's an interesting point i've never i you know i've thought about it i've asked myself you know this question before i've never taken the time to do the research to answer my own question but i know that at least during the deliberations of the jury um-hum they can ask questions yes i don't know whether they can go back and call witnesses for that though it's it depends on the the transcript they can ask uh points of order of law um-hum and maybe they can ask for a review of the transcript right uh but uh asking questions during the trial my experience as a juror uh well it was a traffic situation uh there were three points of law that had to be made and the County Attorney did not make the points um-hum but the uh defendant took the stand on his own behalf unfortunately he made the points himself in his own testimony um-hum may i ask you a question um-hum why does your voice sound familiar to me um i work for E Systems that's that's probably why it does i work for GTE okay your your voice you know when uh i didn't recognize the name but the more i listen to your voice i uh i know i have heard it somewhere and i was trying to place where i had heard it that's very interesting but now back to the topic okay but uh because i work for uh Hal Ammon oh i know Hal Ammon quite well yes i am on staff to Hal Ammon to GTE okay so well say hi to Al or Hal the next time you see him i i will and which will probably be the uh Monday as a matter of fact and tell yeah well tell him that Bill Mayhood sell hi said hi okay Bill i recognize the name now i and uh my name is Jim Moscow okay and uh so i've heard the name and uh well back to the topic i guess we've talked long enough Bill all right but uh all right well thank you for calling and nice and have a good weekend thank you good night good-bye well i really enjoy reading the newspaper we get the daily and Dallas Morning News and i try to look at it if i get busy i don't get a chance to pick it up like this week i noticed several copies have been untouched haven't been touched but uh well do you have time to read the paper in the morning well not in the morning but um if the well i have two son children and if they uh go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i'll you know maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something you know a lot a lot of people don't take newspapers at all we we took the Morning News for a while and then uh well we've been taking the Times Herald for ages and then um-hum uh dog just ran off with my shoe that's off the subject went outside picked it up and ran off anyway um and then we switched the Morning News but we found we couldn't read enough of it and by the time i got home and had time to to read some but but i guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines well we i don't take like Time or Newsweek or anything like that but i do like to watch um CNN i have several chores and things to do so it comes on at like the nine o'clock PM and so i will turn that on while i'm doing some work and i can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it did did you did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about uh Pete Arnett and uh the the news coverage well he didn't have too good of opinion of it no i mean yes i did hear that and so um i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor well any you know Time magazine and even the news that sometimes that that's why i like some diversity the idea that i we have Time which which we we take from time to time and we the problem is they call up and make this deal you know and well we're taking that and and we also hit the Garland uh-huh Garland Daily News i guess it's it comes out sporadically like twice a week or something but i think what's interesting is that if you're that there uh this uh-huh as difficult as he is or as as much as they try they put some bias i had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial hum and that but and and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we don't control the news we just report it the way we the way it is and uh-huh well i wouldn't think that i would really say that that's not true because um it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates yes and so um news stations always tell the story from a certain angle and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions you may never get the truth but you'll have a variety to choose from yes and i i thought that was particularly interesting in the the Gulf War that there were pieces of information that that were apparently uh leaked just as a as as uh a a ploy which was um i i find that fascinating that uh um-hum yeah i do too do you ever listen to the radio or any i listen to KRLD and uh KLIF the news talk radio and i actually listen to CNN radio do you know it was on radio now um-hum no i don't it's on eleven ninety hum i really um have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of even music and um well when i go to work i listen yeah my husband does and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes and says oh i just heard on the news that such and such happened you know if it's something really interesting and and then i'll know to yeah to keep an eye out for it but i've got out of the habit of listening to the radio well with with your you know if you're around the home though and and and can watch TV and read the paper the problem is is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is and then they start repeating everything um-hum and and so it's kind of a oh that's what's interesting is the CNN uh i don't think i'm trying to think if it's much local i listen to a little of that and i listen to a little of ninety point one i i'm i'm inveterate switcher uh-huh that ninety eight point seven i'm i'm eclectic approach do you have a particular local channel that you watch on television well i watch channel five but that has to be that's another bias that has to do with the weather reporting i'm not sure that actually i think channel eight is probably but i know Dave Fox he goes to our church so um-hum um well i am we're fairly new to the area and so we're still shopping for a favorite channel well the channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together uh from Oklahoma City and apparently channel eight was way down and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job and then um-hum they've been some people move around and uh John Chriswell is anyway the i i don't know do you do you do you seem to can you tell much difference between the local radio TV stations well i really think so i noticed on channel eight that there's all of the um anchors are seem to be like White Anglo Saxon Protestant type people and they all seem to be you know fairly similar and i kind of prefer a you know some females i don't recall that they have any female anchors and i like different i like the anchors to be different kinds of people i think that adds to the diversity i think that uh i like that uh there i know you know John Wylie Price i don't know if you kept up but he's been protesting that um-hum yes i have and um i prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because i think you're more more likely to get yeah and i think he has legitimate argument i mean you can uh i i i grew up in Alabama and so i i have some prejudices um-hum but i think that i think that that from a a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station uh i'm not sure i i'm um-hum totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs but i think that uh in some cases there there should be some real opportunity and and some diversity and yeah and this kind of thing and i think that Dallas it turns out though from what i understand has quite good i occasionally go to Saint Louis and uh there for a few days and watch the news and and i think Dallas really does have um-hum have quite good news i think channel eight is the number one uh ABC affiliate in the US i think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he course he pumping his own oh really well we you know like all of the stations seem to be pretty good it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into Houston so we had a where'd you move from a favorite or i did have a favorite channel that i usually tuned into for local news i guess because you get use to you like the anchors and you feel comfortable with them and yeah it is interesting though it becomes a little of personality in fact the the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me oh long time ago twenty years or so even longer than that twenty one twenty three years ago or so um-hum twenty four anyway long time ago and and shortly after i got we got here fourteen years ago and uh they had they had fired him uh because he was too anyway didn't he didn't have the personality and wasn't drawing the crowds and that's interesting is that's that's what the TV stations do they're trying to get ratings um-hum that's true their job and i think if we remember that that they're out after the ratings that's true so that really effects how they report the news and some well it's like the the Dale Hansen on channel eight little is a sometimes a little too cutesy but i wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes have you talked have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes with is he the sports yes i guess it is time to close now so i can run go help put the kids to bed but i have yes it's nice bye-bye okay well good talking to you good night have you been having any uh good weather lately well today was really nice the past few days have been rather chilly uh we had a lot of rain recently i'm in Texas where are you oh i'm in Texas Plano uh-huh oh you are do you work for TI oh i see yes i do yeah so then we've been having just about the same weather yeah it was pretty nice today but i stayed inside i came up with a cold couple days ago so i'm taking care of that but uh yeah it's nice and sunny out yeah have you been doing anything outside in this great weather uh not lately but uh yeah there was a little bit of rain couple days ago and they had tornados up in uh Oklahoma and i guess in Wichita Falls too no yeah i know we had a tornado watch watch a couple of days ago but nothing really happened uh-huh are you originally from uh Texas no i'm from Wisconsin originally uh i don't know what the weather's been like up there but uh typically in March it's still uh kind uh kind of like winter uh very cold the um-hum well i lived in New York for a long time so Texas is Texas weather is quite uh different for me well we had a real mild winter here though yeah we did we uh they're always mild to me compared to New York winters have you have you ever been to New York in the winter okay i can believe that uh-huh no i've well Wisconsin gets pretty bad sometimes too but uh probably not near as bad as New York uh i'm sure uh-huh i think it depends on what part of the state right but this winter here i think we only had one instance of ice one weekend right and uh other than that uh it was uh maybe just uh three real cold spells i don't have too much uh shrubbery damage from that but uh still some didn't manage to survive yeah the only thing i don't like about uh Dallas weather is that it gets a little bit too hot sometimes in the summer yeah it gets it gets uh hot but uh it's not very humid and there's always a nice uh breeze blowing yeah yeah like New York was really humid you know you but you could you could walk around outside in New York you could just stay outside in in it you know because it was i guess the average summer temperature is about eighty uh you know in the eighties yeah and it was pretty pleasant except for the humidity you know i've been here about thirteen years and i've gotten quite quite acclimated to the weather i the summers don't bother me anymore at all i don't mind when it gets over a hundred degrees uh-huh well at least you can plan you can say well uh i'm going to go to the beach next Wednesday and you'll know that it's going to be hot enough to go yeah but in in New York you really never know you can plan to you know to go up to the beach on the Fourth of July and then you know it might be seventy degrees or something sure uh-huh i don't know what kind of a summer we're expecting this year i imagine it's going to be hot again yeah yeah i'm sure it will in Dallas Texas well that's pretty typical though uh i don't uh i don't guess it's going to be any much different uh than than it has been in the past so i expect uh July and August we'll see our or uh share of hundred degree days right have you ever been to Canada no i never have um i've been close uh was in Detroit one time just right across the river from Windsor uh-huh uh that's supposed to be really cold weather in the winter that's why New York gets so cold because it's so close to Canada yeah i believe that i was in Wisconsin over uh the Christmas holidays and it was about uh twenty below zero when i got up there uh-huh goodness they uh they had a high of i think eighteen degrees during the week that i was there uh-huh so it's stayed cold for the entire week was it snowing snowing um we got one day of snow and one day of ice other than that it was pretty good just cold um you know uh Christmas really doesn't seem like Christmas to me unless i do see the snow and the ice we don't get too much snow here it uh it's just really pretty with the snow and the ice and all of the lights not necessarily not the ice i should keep leave the ice out of it but the snow is real pretty well i can live without ice yeah the snow is nice doesn't usually last too long here uh-huh i remember i know one Christmas when i was in Dallas it snowed it snowed and and there was a white Christmas but i don't i guess it's been about five or six years ago yeah i remember maybe uh maybe three winters where we had a white Christmas here um-hum other than that it's uh the snow usually doesn't last more than a day or two yeah i just think it's really really pretty we i remember one Christmas here it was sixty degrees that was so strange to me having lived in New York you know uh-huh yeah well that's not uncommon what's really bad here in winter is when we get uh ice on the roads and the temperature doesn't get above freezing there is no uh ice removal equipment yeah yeah and people drive like the street street is dry yeah that is if if the businesses are all open uh lot of them close down yeah i don't think TI's closed down in a couple of years for bad weather that's right we didn't close at all this past winter oh i look forward to one of those days yeah well we usually have to make them up though so not now that's true did you say you work in Plano uh well i work at the main set in Dallas yeah uh-huh oh you do i do too i well did uh did you get much rain two days ago did i get what much rain two days ago yeah Thursday uh i know it sprinkled some i didn't get much rain here in Plano but i guess it really poured in Richardson uh-huh i believe it it it uh it rained at night or something because i saw puddles of water outside but i didn't yeah i don't think we got uh i don't think we got it near as bad as uh Oklahoma and i guess Fort Worth had high high winds in fact uh the wind was responsible for knocking down a light pole at the Water Gardens that killed two people uh-huh uh-huh um-hum so they usually get uh worse weather than we do yeah in winter too well March is the the month for high winds yeah and it's been rather windy here too and we get a lot of tornados too this is the time of the year uh-huh have you heard the forecast for the week coming up no i sure haven't it's i think it's supposed to be nice though yeah i haven't either yeah it's probably going to start getting summer hot seventies eighties i guess yeah well that's nice i've been checking on my plants seeing the the roses bud out already oh you plant oh yeah somewhat uh have to kind of watch watch the weather make sure everything is going the way it's supposed to uh-huh waiting for the waiting waiting for the weather to get nice out so i can go ahead and uh replace some of the some of the dead shrubs from winter uh-huh but uh like i said i stayed in today because i picked up a cold the other day so didn't feel like going outside and doing much yeah well it probably they'll probably do okay now i have a friend that's planted some uh planted a garden some things like collard greens and cabbage uh-huh and uh they're coming up really pretty you just need a just need a good rain yeah we we really haven't didn't get enough rain the other day to uh do much good for uh things growing just a lot of weeds right now and they'll come up whether we get nice weather or not um-hum yeah yeah well i live in an apartment so the only thing i grow are plants inside and i don't do very very well with those i think the temperature in here uh-huh well you've got a lot more control over the inside temperature than you do than you do outside yeah but i guess i just don't know what i'm doing okay sometimes i i'd sit the plants outside on the patio and and i'd forget about them and it gets too hot out there and and they you know burn up and so forth that's happened to quite a few of my plants yeah i don't do well with potted plants outside i tend to neglect neglect them and they sit in the sun too long and dry up or uh if i don't put them in the sun they don't grow yeah um-hum i don't know but uh yeah i guess next week's supposed to be real nice outside i hope it is anyway because uh softball season starts and we're ready to to go outside and do some outdoor activities uh uh-huh well good i hope hope it's nice too okay well uh i haven't heard the forecast for the next for uh coming up for this weekend or next week so i'm not sure what to expect i can only guess that it's supposed to be nice yeah i hope it's as nice as it was today uh-huh seems like it was extra cold last night though i'm not sure what the overnight low was but i know it was cold i had turn on the heat and get quilts yeah oh yeah guess i'll have to turn on the weather on the news tonight see what we're supposed to expect yeah anyway i guess everything's been pretty typical for March uh-huh have to see what uh April or May have to offer you know the summer really starts in Dallas that i remember one one year seems like it started about the end of February yeah hot sometimes it does uh sometimes it'll get in the eighties uh as early as uh January February um-hum yeah but it up in New York it's cold till about June well they still have snow on the ground through March and probably part of April sometimes um yeah one thing about the snow in March it at at least it'll melt it melts quickly up there well it leaves a mess then when it does melt everything thaws out that's true lot of mud i was trying to think about some of my favorite people that i liked in music and they're none of them are recent right um-hum so i like Gordon Lightfoot do you know who he is and the Moody Blues and i like to listen to piano music a whole lot and Willie Nelson yeah uh-huh so you like a a variety sort of easy listening because you you like country but then yeah but not all country i don't like that when they start i don't know i just like Willie Nelson i guess because he's such a character um oh uh-huh yeah i i like some of his songs though they're they're not so they're not so sad country all the time they're just kind of sweet sometimes you know i mean they're not the the typical country where they're just you know my wife left me my dog left me you know yeah my truck is broken down yeah my truck's broken down and my house just burned down you know but yeah and there there's a guy have you ever heard of George Winston he plays piano i think he's dead now but he plays wonderfully no uh-huh i like that are do you do you play the piano is or you just like it very badly i've got a piano my mother got a piano and uh vowed that someone in the family was going to learn so we all had to take lessons yeah and i was the one that did the least poorly so she gave it to me and it's sitting here mostly taking up space but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it it is real relaxing yeah it must be fun to be able to play it and you know if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be that'd be kind of fun i think yeah because i mean i play the flute and not many things you can play that'll you know people will sit there and sing along to and you can't sing along either so but um i like a lot uh i like classical music just because of the when when i i don't play i like jazz music but oh so do i forgot about that i said so do i i forgot about jazz what's that what's that yeah i like a lot like i like uh the the New Age music like with um uh the um um i don't know if you've heard Neurotic Collection yes we've got about five of those i love them yeah i love those too they're just so relaxing uh-huh i'd never heard them before until i went in a music store and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it and i just i heard a piece and it was just so wonderful and then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it yeah yeah isn't that nice i mean it's nice when you have a piece that that is so so peaceful that everybody likes you know and uh yeah it it it it you know it has pieces that are uplifting but it uh it's mostly relaxing and you don't uh because it doesn't have words you know you don't feel like there's anything you have to remember you know as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean or but uh i mean you can just sit you know those little booklets that come along with it and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music my my little boy has gotten so into it that he's identified the the people that have written certain songs and he buys the yeah yeah the pieces that have that person yeah oh okay i see what you're saying yeah you know on it huh i mean i don't even know who did which ones but he does i i can't identify them either i just like them i couldn't i know which ones come next but i don't even know their names most of them i don't know their names of the song but i i can identify them but i like that and i like um course i i like classical music and uh yeah were you in the band i was in the band yeah so and i was in like chamber music groups and stuff so so was i i'm used to pieces i and and i played classical flute i didn't play play jazz flute or anything like that so i can i can relate to it i suppose but uh and i like i'm like you i like the older stuff too because i like Chicago and i like i like um uh yeah let me think who um i like Hebert um oh you don't know Hebert Laws but Hebert Laws is a flute player he's a jazz flute player and i like um uh Chuck Mangione do you know who Chuck Mangione is yeah i like Chuck Mangione i'm trying to think of all um yeah uh what's his name plays the trumpet um i like the Moody Blues yeah yeah i like Moody Blues i i like mostly the older groups i think did you like them oh but we do have i like Simply Red we got Simply Red i thinking of all our CD's that we have what i really like and uh i like Breeze i like the group i think just because they all sort of sound they sound like a lot like red uh Simply Red if i'm going to listen to that kind of music nowadays that's it's easy in listening so what type Simply Red i've never heard of that um is it just instrumental no it's it's got people singing but it's it is instrumental but it's it's got people singing but it's got a like a whole bunch of people singing you know um how many people are in yeah on he can't hear me i i don't remember how many people but it's it's got men men and women and it's not it's it's nice i mean it's pleasant you know music it's not what's it hurts your ears to hear it but it's not as it's not like uh Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it you know it doesn't have like all the brass and everything yeah yeah well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road we're going to go to Commerce and see a friend and then i'm going to go to Sulphur Springs yeah where are you oh you must live in this area we're in Sherman okay so we're in Garland oh okay you're going to Commerce for East Texas or something oh okay yeah yeah yeah just because there's a friend up there not because there's much else oh okay well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas that's why i was just wondering yeah East Texas is recruiting for you know their fall semester and they're they've been doing a lot of that in the area for colleges well they're not colleges they're not going to recruit me anymore i'm through no more for me what what do you do no more huh well right now i'm just a homemaker but i'm going to school uh for legal assistant and that's why i know so and uh just nothing basically are you going to go to East Texas for that no no it uh no i don't go to East Texas uh i got a degree from TWU but i'm really interested in legal you know in the legal environment but i don't want to be a lawyer so i said well i think i'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant so that'd probably be pretty interesting i was summoned down to the courthouse last week they had summoned eight hundred people about four hundred showed up and it was for a murder trial oh uh-huh this guy had supposedly uh strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose anyway this is happened in nineteen eighty three yeah and they had us fill out a long questionnaire we stayed till about one thirty and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time and the trial won't take place until June yeah that's how it works and they say it's going to last about two to three weeks and this guy in front of me said i can't believe i was summoned i was an investigator and i was tailing the woman that was killed well then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been uh getting cocaine from his client and then selling it and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the state against her so he'll have his sentence reduced and this is the man that was in front of you oh well they'll weed him out yeah the the investigator yeah he he got off right away and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that so i figure that that will make me biased and i won't be chosen yeah uh-huh hopefully well not necessarily but there's probably something else that might make you because you could know about you could know about the crime but not necessarily be taken off the jury you know not be accepted for jury the jury yeah you i mean pretty much a lot of people would know about it you know and and know some of the different things about it but um they they might weed you out some other way you know if you if you don't believe like if this was a capital crime and and you don't believe in if you don't believe in death penalty you're not going to be picked at all so but the death penalty no i said that i could i could believe in it in certain instances but i would be i'd find it hard to levy that against somebody yeah so see there there they would have a doubt about you that you know because if that's what if that's what the punishment is in that in that instance then you're always going to say you know uh-huh you know not guilty you're you're not going to want to have them have that crime uh that punishment so yeah but then when you're uh when you're picked see i was picked for another murder trial before oh gosh and it's so hard because you know uh-huh everybody is wanting to go on and and get the sentence done and if you're trying to hold out you know there's so much pressure on you and you've got to come up with a decision well especially with something where you have to find you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt you have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's like do you really feel that sure about what do you think about um the way the criminal justice system handles trials well you know they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers yeah but you know it's pretty hard to try let's say the man down the street that's living on Social Security or somebody that's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people like the juries that i've served on are businessmen uh-huh okay now they don't understand that you know maybe he needed fifty dollars so he held up the seven eleven yeah okay they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars all the time so you know i think that it a a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket someone that you know you can't really do it ethnically you know but you could do it you could probably get it a little closer but then there's another thing that i disagree with in Texas is sometimes you have a jury of six and sometimes you have a jury of twelve yeah yeah and i don't know why they do that do you have any reason do you know of any reason why they do that well i think the six is called a Grand Jury and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial or it's whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused of okay i see you know and held over for trial okay i don't know much about the Grand Jury how do you feel about the in Texas i noticed since i've been here in twelve years that they they break up the the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial yeah i don't know i i think that uh i know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked however well we know there's a few out there yeah it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and give it you give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong or for you know if if if the judge is not of high moral standards he could be bought off at much easier than twelve people could um-hum yeah it's yeah would be pretty hard well i don't think you know i don't think that if i was the criminal that i would like the judge passing sentence on me if the jury found me guilty then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be and i think it's not only that it's a waste of our money we have to have a trial for this person then two weeks down the road we have to sentence sentence excuse me set a sentencing date so now we're back in court again and that's more money spent um-hum it's not so much that i that i haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges what bothers me is that uh they really don't mean anything no someone could be sentenced to thirty five years and yet you know the the parole system uh it's going to let them out in in three years for good behavior and it's not working either no it's not it seems that we have more and more repeat offenders i know i don't know how you all are there where you're at but where we're at now our jails are overcrowded we just built a brand new one two years ago um-hum oh i think they're all overcrowded and it's overcrowded they've uh i think i heard Fort Worth that uh so now they start turning them loose they've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowded they're not allowed to accept any new inmates now what are they supposed to do they turn them loose well no i mean they're not allowed to accept any new inmates yeah so what are they supposed to do with people that they need to put in jail you know well the way it it seems the way it's been working here's there yeah go ahead it seems the way it's been working here is they let those out that have spent two or three years out of their five to twenty sentence or five to life um-hum something that is working and i i i really like the system of house arrest where uh a someone's wear someone wears a bracelet yeah they yeah and they like a ankle bracelet that's a monitor and they are not allowed i mean the some of them are even allowed to work they can go to their regular job they come home they have to be home by such and such a time they keep they're instructed uh so that this this electronic monitor is turned on at at a certain time and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts yeah all right and uh they can put a they usually install a video monitor in the house and when the parole officer calls to check on them they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it all right so that they can see that this person is actually at home in their house doing what they're supposed to be doing and that's working rather well that's a good system that allows people to actually continue to be productive members of society while yeah it would allow the they're yeah instead of being completely penned up you know paying back for whatever crime they've committed and that way it would give you know the probation department and parole department they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in in Lubbock oh yeah and that would give you know at least they don't have to drive all over town trying to find one guy or trying to see six or seven people yeah um-hum i've i've really i could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what i think we ought to do about it but sometimes it's pretty messed up isn't it well something that i really don't understand is when someone goes to jail um-hum and they have a job in jail and they work that they should i and this may sound cruel but i do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes i mean they're in jail for crying out loud what do they need cigarettes for yeah well see and there's another thing about the justice system that i don't like and there's a lot of people that tell me that that maybe my thoughts are wrong i came from California um-hum and when you're in jail they take you out just like they do in Alabama or anywhere else in what they call a chain gang and they clean the city parks um-hum oh i think that's a wonderful idea and they clean the city streets but you know we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner and i know yeah but i know families myself that have three and four children in Lubbock that don't make that much more than that more than that i know and they're not you know they're not doing anything to support themselves while they're there the thing that the thing that gets me is that while we're supporting them they're working when they get out of jail they get handed all that money yeah yeah that really ti cks me off i think that while they are in jail and they are working their wages should go like i don't know they could uh some percentage like eighty five percent of their wages should go toward their room and board yeah yeah well figured on um a whatever basis how much it costs to actually support them for a year um-hum see now i also believe in and when they get out they should have uh i don't know you know some reasonable amount of money yeah to start like a couple of thousand dollars but there should be a limit over which they that it all goes back to the State anything that they've earned while they're in prison should go back to the State except for that you know there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with yeah to help yeah but at least they would at least that way they would be helping pay for their own exactly absolutely that's the part that i really think we need to change and something else that i would and something else that i would like to see is is uh victim reimbursement you know because they you know like you say these guys are in jail and they're working they're getting paid but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from or beat to death or has nothing you know our our victims are victimized period and the law has no has nothing right no uh regulations to deal with that they they know how to deal with the penal system and they know how to deal with the criminal but they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens i guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect absolutely yeah but it's but i sure don't i i strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself there that um-hum i think it works much better if it's if it's the actual jury yeah because well the see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime the jury gets to see the whole trial as does the judge but you know if if they figure there's um-hum maybe litigating circumstances or something like that whereas maybe the judge does just doesn't care you committed this crime so i'm just going to throw the book at you whereas the jury may have a little uh-huh shall we say sympathy you know he did this but you know why did he do this is there is there a basis for it yeah in some cases that it it would work that way in some cases it would work the other way yeah in some cases where the judge says okay i'll give you you know two to three years and then the jury would would slam them and and i think that that the jury probably has more of a right to sentence than the judge all the time yeah well they have a stronger debate too because there's twelve people there they have to decide whether or not he's guilty and then they can sit in the at the same time and decide what his punishment would be and you'd have more than one person's input on it uh-huh yeah i think that's probably a much fairer way and you know we're supposed to be and i quote in a democratic society so you know if you can find me guilty then you ought to be able to pass sentence yeah and a lot of jurors not that i know of but you know a lot of jurors may just sit there and say yeah he's guilty but i don't have to deal with it from here you know so the judge takes care of all of that yeah it might be more it may would be more work for the jury but it would be a more responsible way to deal with it yeah it would uh serving yeah serving on the jury would be definitely more responsible you'd have to be a definitely more responsible person the thing that i i don't really like i i don't know if uh a lot of jury selection processes that i've seen have been a so what's your favorite team or do you have a favorite team or well i uh i'd have to say my favorite team would be Cincinnati Bengals Bengals um-hum yeah uh i was uh i was pulling for the Bengals when they uh lost the Super Bowl oh that was sad wasn't it two years ago was it yeah yeah yeah that was just a couple of years ago yeah i i pulled for them for the sole reason because i didn't want 49ers to win anybody who plays the 49ers really yeah well uh it's kind of hard to uh to know what to do with some of these teams and they're either extremely strong or very very weak and uh nothing much in between yeah yeah that's true uh my favorite team is are is are the Raiders oh you like the Raiders yeah i mean i've liked them ever since the season that they won the Super Bowl last i think it was eighty four i think it was um-hum uh-huh and uh i pretty much like them ever since that and they haven't they haven't produced since then but no but least i've stuck with them i'm loyal uh-huh well that that and that's the important thing i mean whether they win or lose why the fun is is in the supporting them yeah and staying with it and hoping that uh you know the next time is a better time around yeah what other teams uh do you like up there well um or do you not watch much football oh i love football oh really oh watch it uh every every game that's on i watch every Sunday and Monday yeah and Thursday nights oh that's right no there uh well let's see i never use thought about football too much yet yeah me either it's kind of like they they gave me the topic and i'm like football jeez it's been a long time yeah right uh uh did you know that they're playing a game today yeah that's the World League yeah yeah what time is that supposed to be they're playing it right now oh are they yeah i think it's uh ABC that's carrying it it's either ABC or NBC one or the other i think i'm not too sure one of the major stations it's uh Barcelona versus New York oh hum well uh i haven't for some reason have never really gotten enthused about football in the summer from from the the World League yeah the temperature's just not right yeah yeah and uh it just seems like it should only be done in cold weather yeah rather than just be played at anytime anytime during the year we usually don't uh we usually don't have very cold weather down here you know during uh during football season it it gets colder later on in the season um-hum but it takes a good while for it to get cold huh but couple couple Christmases ago we had a a freak storm and i live near the coast actually i live like right on the coast of North Carolina ooh and uh what they they called it like a winter hurricane and so instead of bringing high winds and destruction and rain it just brought a lot of snow and basically it rain it it snowed only on the coast but not inland uh-huh so the coast was completely we had like ten foot snow drifts which in the coast we barely get an inch of snow a year oh is that right yeah and so we you know because being near the water we get less snow than anybody else yeah and this time we had a bunch of snow we we i had fun playing in in the snow playing football in the snow and so i mean i i had never done that before and it's it's so much fun because you can hit harder and land harder and it doesn't matter because it's snow and yeah is that right huh i would think uh that if you were real cold and you hit uh hit the ground that it would seem to hurt more yeah well we had like layers of clothing to keep away the snow well that helps doesn't it yeah but the snow also helps you know and it it we had like one foot deep snow in this in this open field and so it was a little hard to run but when you got hit and you fell you didn't really feel it oh yeah you just felt the hit of the person but when you hit the ground it was you know just snow it was it was pretty fun but it's it's a lot better to play it in the cold weather that's true um-hum yeah right right what kind of weather you having right now well right now we're having nice weather i i probably say in in the upper sixties maybe lower seventies right now oh my well our weather's suddenly turned cold again uh our weather is so unstable you never know yeah especially at this time yes and uh this morning why it was raining and it was quite cold and then it seemed to warm up somewhat and then before uh before i got out of church it cooled off again so much so that i uh stopped at home to change coats because i had to go down to the hospital and uh the coat i had on was just too light in weight yeah is it very windy up there now yes very strong winds yeah we had some pretty strong winds pick up this morning and they've been up been with us all day well well been awfully nice talking with you yeah this is the first time i've talked with someone up north really mostly i've been talking with people in Texas yeah right right most people seem to be there out there seems like they have ninety percent of the people calling from Texas right okay well good talking to you yeah nice talking to you too bye uh-huh bye-bye okay the topic that we have Victoria again as I mentioned was what do you feel is wrong with our public school system and i guess if i were to look at with four grown children and having been through all four of them through public schools and colleges i guess the public school system i would have to say is that we probably need to pay our teachers a little bit more exactly we need to we need to probably try to get more one on one with the teachers and the and the students if we could smaller classrooms possibly and the other thing was we need to really really to tighten up our discipline in schools because they run here in New England i'm not sure about the rest of the country but i know the schools are almost running rampant up here exactly and it's too bad because there are you know serious drinking problems with with real um you know young young kids i'm talking kids that are nine ten eleven twelve years old drug problems go ahead i'm sorry i would when i was in school um i was supposedly in one of the best school systems in the country in Fairfax county and i'm i think back and i i don't feel like i i could have learned a lot more and don't feel like i learned as much i've only been out of school high school for four years but i think i could have learned a lot more and i've i worry about the children that are in uh-huh the other school systems that aren't as good um i don't know any particular ones but you know when when they say one of the where i went to school was one of the best counties then i think yeah i lived i lived that's just outside of Washington i lived in Fairfax county that was really really a nice nice area down there and uh-huh my i had the same situation here my kids were we bought them up and put them in the public schools here in Rhode Island and they were not not too too bad and this was going back like ten years i guess ten years ago they were not too too bad at that time and i was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to move from Rhode Island to Texas with with TI with my job and i worked there in the southwest for ten almost ten or eleven years and the kids got a my kids got a much better education education in Texas simply because they had the opportunity to have more one on one uh-huh uh relationships with the with the uh the facility okay and and that helped like especially one of my sons he was he could learn but he really had to work at learning if if that makes sense to you uh-huh and and uh again like you say there was and you are still a student and there's so much more you could have learned and but i i i don't know i think discipline i guess if i were to look at one thing we've lost well kids used to have a respect for the teacher i guess at one time but i think we've kind of lost that in out school system and i'm not really sure how to get it back i say discipline and that might be the wrong choice of words but it uh-huh i know um i know with um i think teachers need to be paid more i have a lot of friends who and myself who've thought about going into elementary education and to teaching and then they looked and saw how much money they got and said well there's a lot of other things I can do and get a lot more money oh yeah it's so it it's so hard and and it's so hard to compete and and that's not one of the things that's gonna make the people like yourself who are just graduating from colleges you know or out across the country wanna go jumping into a an education field when the when there's you can almost double your pay in almost any other field you know for as a as a entry level uh-huh exactly and i am not saying that we should give them the world either but I think we should pay them a little more money um they say a hundred and eighty days a year is all they work and i don't really believe that i think it's a lot more than that when you figure the hours and time they put into the school and stuff alright and even if is only a hundred and eighty days a year lets pay them for the hundred and eighty days a year i mean and and i mean their their day doesn't end you know when schools out no no they that's what i mean at one time we we used to able to carry that over to the kids of course i i can see the teacher's point too where at at three o'clock or four o'clock they want to go home and not worry about kids so but if they had probably some renumeration to help them say you know maybe i'll give this kid a little extra help or something uh-huh in the long run i think it would really be worth while i mean they they uh go home and grade papers lesson plans prepare for the next day what what is your major in school that your ah super that sounds good and you're finishing up this year huh i'm an interior design major yep so exactly in May well that's great i i wish you all the best in in your future in your endeavors out there in what ever you are doing and it's good to talk to a a a student rather than yeah most of the folk i've talked to are are industrial people that like my self that have been in the work work force for a number of years and and it's ah it's refreshing to talk to ah to some of you younger folks and get your ideas and thing you know and see how you feel about things uh-huh uh-huh well i don't know what else we can do about this school situation Victoria and if there's anything else you'd like to add i think that's about it you too you have a nice day and i'm going to say good bye for now and if you're ever up Rhode Island way around TI look me up it's Ray Smith at TI in Albrough Massachusetts alrighty you too thank you bye bye have a nice one Victoria and good luck in your future bye bye okay pro football i like two teams one the New York Giants and the second is the Raiders pro football okay that's right across the country i don't think i could i don't think i could yes that's one end to the other that's true i don't think i could spread my patriotism any more than well actually i like uh San Francisco 49ers too but uh yeah San Francisco i go with so yeah uh i'm surprised being that being from Dallas i thought you'd be a Dallas fan well i'm not originally from Dallas so uh i kind of i moved around a lot when i was well up until last year and uh so i've i've kind of picked teams all over the country oh i see uh-huh i liked uh the Cowboys i lived in in West Texas in Abilene i worked with TI in Abilene for ten years and i really enjoyed watching the Cowboys play and they um-hum they went through a rebuilding thing down there and and and uh i watched them go downhill like all the teams do you know like Pittsburgh did like the New York Giants did like like i think the 49ers are about to do um-hum yeah i think that's true i think the the players get a little old and get a little tired and uh well the only thing that San Francisco may have done differently is that they've done a good job in the last few years of of getting rid of their older players and and bringing up new a bunch of new people sure you're exactly right and and this the other teams failed to do Houston failed to do that they had Bum Phillips in there and a and a good running back i forget to uh i forget that fellow's name uh you know right Campbell Earl Campbell Campbell Earl Campbell and they run that man to death um-hum but it it worked for them but uh you're right they they kind of and yep but they had nothing to back it up and exactly and uh you see that so much in pro sports we we go through this um-hum this rebuilding cycle without a without a backup bench and it's it's happened in basketball here with the Celtics and this year they finally gotten some backup support so you don't have to keep five guys out there for an hour you know yeah that's right but i like uh i like the Giants i i kind of think they snuck into the championship this year this past year and and i'm not so sure they'll get away with it again but well i think i got to agree with you there they they kind of pulled it off this year but i like they did a they had a excellent game in the Super Bowl uh i was real impressed but uh because yes yes i think the whole thing of how they got there was to me i i kind of well i i guess that's the rules and and the way the and the way the the play-offs are run but i i don't know i just think there was probably some other teams that they only missed by couple of points and they really should have been in there but um-hum i like the Giants because of uh Bill Parcells and i like him as a coach and he's he's been for years a a good coach i i think um-hum i'm not sure that they can repeat okay well as hard as it is to repeat anyway uh and as as close as i think the New York Giants were to the rest i mean yeah yeah there really wasn't a a dominant team this year no and uh you know if if if like San Francisco was dominant for two years uh they had a you know they had a chance to but uh i don't think New York's going to be able to do that no i don't think they'll be able to carry it that far uh right they've got i mean they've got some excellent players uh who who would you if you had your pick out of anyone of the league teams who would you say is going to be the new new uh Super Bowl champions this year for ninety one hum uh i might go with Buffalo yeah that kind of that kind of put you out on a limb a little bit i guess you know this may be really out on a limb but i might go with Buffalo as as good as they were toward the end of the year got into the Super Bowl and just just missed think they'll be hungry next year i thought i thought for sure that Buffalo was going to be in there this past year i really did and i would that would be my choice that would be my choice again this year yeah because with Kelly at quarterback when he went down hurt they brought another young fellow in there Reich uh Reich or yeah yeah Reicher or whatever Reicher whatever his name is and boy he they never even missed a beat i mean they just kept right on pouncing i think it was no and if it weren't for the tumble of the ball Buffalo would have been there this year and and to me that's another super team course um-hum i'm being up here in the northeast corner i kind of like these northeast teams yeah i can believe that course i used to like the Patriots too they were just down the road from here but boy the Patriots are kind of sad they're now they're talking of moving out of town and they ought to all get out of town and take Kiam with them yeah well yeah i think that's probably would be best for the area but uh yeah they they really i think they hurt the sport this year with all that controversy over that locker room incident with uh with uh all that the reporter and stuff and um-hum i think they just could have handled it more professionally i i i believe that they they hurt themselves i guess oh yeah they've had a lot of trouble with uh with the Sullivan boys and Kiam they didn't really see eye to eye and of course the the big political football up here you know now they're now they're trying to move the team somewhere else the last i heard um-hum boy just kind of i've been a Patriot fan for years and years and you know when you when they're only like thirty miles from where you live you can get to see the games once in a while and um-hum it's just a shame you keep going there and like week after week and every week you come away a loser i mean you after a while guys get tired and we just didn't go anymore so yeah well losing is i mean i'm i'm originally from Saint Louis and Saint Louis Cardinals when they were there were uh a mostly a losing team but yeah sure but they played like professionals exactly right they exactly and and yeah they never they never did things to embarrass the town and that's what i think would be would be bad about New England yeah yeah they they really didn't do good at all for us up here and that's that's too bad because they were they were some good players they are some good players on the Patriots team you know and um-hum well that's true i think they need to get rid of Grogan he's been around too long they need to put him in the front office doing management or something but they need to get him off the field and and get the manager well he's going to he's going to kill himself he is eventually he's going to end up paralyzing himself or something i mean i worry about that guy because he's been he's been hurt so many times and he's not as agile these young fellows they just take advantage of that and and and though they don't show it and say it and do it intentionally oh yeah it's just their strength will beat him you know sometimes yeah well the only thing that might save him is that in the backs of their minds they may think that they don't want to hurt him permanently sure of course no one does i'm sure they don't you know it was and so they may let up on him so i don't know that that would be and the other thing is they're going to be there in that same position one of these days you know and hopefully they like Bo Jackson now as i understand has hurt himself in both baseball and football he he's there's question as to whether he's going to come back i haven't read today's paper right right well the last i heard i didn't read it in the paper but i heard it on TV was that they were still saying that he's out permanently you know yeah is that right there's a there's a fabulous career yeah well they were they were talking i think i was watching uh the NCAAs and they were talking about uh you know this is one reason they say that that athletes get the money as quickly as they can you know get all the money that you know oh sure because they're they're tenure is real short right and it could end at anytime anytime at all yeah but yeah yeah he may come back into baseball but i doubt if he'll ever come back and play you know it was weird when i what i read in the paper was uh the uh the the baseball career was over permanently the football career might not be and i don't understand that i would have thought it was the other way around well i would have too i that's the same that's that's i don't understand that obvious i think football is much more strenuous than baseball especially yeah i mean you get a chance to sit down in baseball every once in a while you know if you're not up for three innings or whatever but yeah um-hum and you don't get hit yeah the key right there yeah or you're not supposed to anyway some some big fellows not out there trying to stomp you into the ground you know i mean but uh i that that's surprising i i was i had not heard that in the in the that's right it it may have been a misquote but that's sure what i got yeah they no i'm i'm sure they probably well it all depends i guess on on what they feel is you know what he can do because baseball is not a light an easy sport either that's a very very athletic sport lot of running and stuff like that and the hip may be a real problem but i i would think that football would have been more of a detriment to him than than baseball would oh yeah yeah i was i i was kind of surprised that uh that the Royals let him go with a football career as long as they did you know well Steve i'll tell you i think i still think Joe Montana's the best quarterback that ever handled a ball um-hum and Terry Bradshaw i think is probably even better than he is or better or was was better than than Joe Montana is now because i of course another another Steeler fan showing up here you know another black and yellow surfacing up here you know this is the black and blue league up here in the corner um-hum but i like Bradshaw as a quarterback and i think uh Joe Montana's probably one of the finest and John Elway i believe that fellow if he had some different people in front of him he would be on par with with Joe Montana because i really think that Denver did not do much for Elway and his career except make him look bad on times when he really should not have looked that bad well that's uh i agree with you there i mean he didn't have the surrounding cast that Montana had there's no doubt about that yeah that's a fact i like John Elway i think he was a fabulous he he still is he's got a he's got a lot of years left in him i don't think he'll do it in Denver though no i don't believe so i don't believe he's going to be able to get the job done in Denver he's going to run up some big numbers and stuff but i don't believe he's going to get the job done there because Denver simply because Denver is not not the i'm not even yeah doesn't have enough depth i don't think to support him like like Joe Montana got supported with the 49ers well i think it's it's not only depth i don't think that they've got the spirit or whatever to go out and get the people to support him i mean yeah that's that could be true too yeah the coaching staff seems i mean they were they were fighting each other coaching staff and Elway and yeah yeah that in-fighting can really destroy a team and its ability to win oh yeah that did it to New England a couple years ago didn't it yeah pardon me didn't it do that to New England a couple years ago oh it certainly did it most certainly did yeah we as i say we went through the Sullivans that that owned the team you know and and owned the stadium and um-hum it's unreal the in-fighting it was it was just it's every day in the paper was like you know it was like saga like a like a yeah like a soap opera it you know who's fighting with who who doesn't want to go out on the field who doesn't want to catch it's unreal i mean you know that that's really detrimental to the team oh yeah well Steve it's been nice talking with you yeah it has it sure has and i i'd like to try this thing every once in a while i thought i'd give it a try this afternoon being so rainy i'm locked in up here anyway so well like i say i i guess i'll root for any football game because i really like the sport and i'm glad that was my topic today so yeah it worked out real good you uh you uh take care of yourself and if you're ever up this way to TI in Attleboro look me up my name's Ray Smith and i work in building twelve you too all right i will all right okay come on up bye-bye you you take care bye-bye uh books yes mainly i read the Bible these days that's very good i do too good that's great to hear uh and Christian literature uh i've kind of i used to read a lot of uh novels uh-huh but it seems as though if you really want to set a time side time to read the Bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading uh-huh yeah it does it and i i been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart and he really has it's getting to where a just really want to read it that's good that's good it it it's uh it's hard for me to find time also to read uh a lot of times i do just read magazines and stuff like that for for you know because i don't have a lot of time but when i do get to sit down and and read i like to read the Bible and i like to read i read to my daughter a lot too do you and uh i like to read you know Bible i have Bible storybooks so i like reading those to her and she really enjoys those uh-huh uh-huh so that's good and it and it's kind of short because we don't woe don't have a lot of time uh-huh to read so it's real enjoyable yeah for both of us have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti's Frank E no i guess i haven't uh This Present Darkness and uh uh i forget the title the other well he uh he's also written a lot of children how old is your daughter five five okay he's written some children's books as well and they're all spiritually uh oriented yeah oh really what's his name again Peretti Frank E Peretti P E R E T T I Frank E Peretti i have to look for those uh-huh yeah do because uh i love to read his his uh children's books just just to read them well that's good yeah oh they're good they're great and it's uh like uh uh usually about a family of um that's good archeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into like uh uh digging in old ruins and running across like uh the old gods uh-huh oh yeah oh that sounds pretty neat yeah it is it's real exciting oh i'll have to look for those and it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know so right well that's neat well i i have a my daughter has Precious Moments collection and i like that because it's a it's real easy to uh-huh uh follow for her you know uh gosh if if i read straight out of the Bible to her she'd never understand any of it well it's hard for me that's right it is it is real hard to to follow and understand and uh-huh uh i've got a Bible that uh has a little bit of a uh a glossary in the back and it helps explain who people are that's that's about the hardest thing is who's related to who i know it and especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats yeah yes yes it sure is but but it is good reading and it's good for us and and everything i really do enjoy it uh-huh that's right but uh i also but then on the other extreme i like to read uh i guess horror i don't know horror Steven King type books uh-huh yeah i've read a lot of his too the and i i like that that's good fun reading yeah can't put them down no you can't you really can't they are good and ooh they just they're just so suspenseful uh-huh yeah i really do enjoy his uh there's another guy oh what can what is his name oh durn you would well you know when you're recording you can't remember remember i know uh oh Dean uh Kratz or Kranz or Judith Krantz yeah who Judith Krantz i know her uh no it's a guy oh okay and he he writes the same thing though it's that real gruesome horror stories yeah oh ooh yeah yeah that's good Koontz uh his last name ends in a Z i know that yeah oh i think i know who you're talking about uh i've seen i don't think i can pronounce it either but yeah uh yeah i'm in a book club and i think i've seen his books uh-huh in there i've never read any of his i kind of got burnt out on Steven King though it seems like but they're real it's all the did you ever read the uh uh oh it's one of his first books The Stand yes that oh that long thing i know it and that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that i mean yeah they do kind of follow or you know that are similar uh-huh i love that book though i thought it was great yeah it really was and i loved The Shining ooh yes that was that was my favorite oh those hedges when they started moving whenever they they made that into a movie i was thinking oh my gosh if they show that i'll just die for some reason that scared me more than anything yeah yeah yeah yeah that is he just brings stuff alive you know you could just visualize everything that's yeah and that was a pretty scary movie too yeah i think they did a pretty good job but they didn't follow it exactly but they did give it you know do it justice yeah uh-huh that's right but uh most of the time they don't with when follow books very well when they ma ke them into movies yeah that's true i liked it as well yeah yeah uh i did too that's another big fat one yeah yeah that was good i liked uh i also liked uh Cujo did you read that one yeah and except it broke my heart i'm a dog lover yeah me too and then uh Night Stand is that Night no it was uh Dead Dead Zone that's one i liked what Dead Zone oh yeah i've read that one too that was a that was a real good one he's written a lot of books boy he just sits down eight hours a day just like any other job i know it right and then he has some under uh another name that's right that one about the gypsies or that hunger or something uh that he's written yeah yeah uh i think his name was Bachman he wrote under the name of Bachman yeah Richard Bachman yeah he is really interesting yeah he's so prolific yeah ooh i wish i could do that oh i know it and i have gone back and after i i graduated i read some of the old classics that i just bluffed my way through and have found that i enjoy them quite a bit too uh uh-huh i do too i love old good old once you can get into the language you know the language uh yeah but it's like it's English but it's not the same English they speak today right so it's kind of hard to keep you know at it but their worthwhile that's true but i that's that was one of my favorite subjects in school was uh literature literature yeah me too i used to love those old good good old books uh-huh i didn't mind doing that at all Nathaniel Hawthorne is pretty scary

watch it every now and then that's hilarious okay well we try it like here they show it like every day oh serious and then like on Thursdays is the night where the new ones come on oh that's cool but we watch it like every day but i like late night we don't watch uh what we do is we stay up until around one thirty and then they show the Twilight Zone at one thirty uh-huh and so we just stay and watch that Twilight Zone rules man Twilight Zone rules the what yeah that's all i used i used to live in the house that the guy owned are you serious yeah it was really it was really oh well it was all full with uh shelves everywhere and we didn't have enough books to fill it up but that's psychedelic but uh so what what do you like why do you like David Letterman oh he just like totally sarcastic and hilarious and i don't know i'm a lot like him in a way so so the and he's got curly hair and so do i so wait did you watch Saturday Night Live what he's got what curly hair and so do i so hey hey i got long hair wait wait cool how long is it uh i don't know but people the other day i went into a bar and this guy asked me to dance all he saw was my hair and he goes do you want to dance i turn around and go what he goes do you want to dance i go no no he goes oh oh i'm sorry i go yeah you better be i go you better be so that's hilarious but okay so did wait do you watch Saturday Night Live yesterday no it with the uh who was on the music people wasn't that Fishbone yeah i saw that it was awesome but i didn't see the rest of it yeah no oh you missed Wayne's World Wayne's World was pretty cool are you serious they're awesome so uh let's see what else uh see like all we do here is like every time we walk in the room we turn on the TV oh really because we don't want to do anything like study or anything so all the all we do is turn like like when i was in high school i used to do like my homework in front of the TV set you know yeah that sucks really uh kind of annoying but that's cool what kind of annoying to like in front of TV like trying to do homework you know yeah trying to write an essay you start talking about you know like In Living Color or something i don't know well i i like i i just i just bogused on all my homework so it really didn't matter cool yeah BS that's the way to do it yeah i know and i did that all through college and it worked too cool yeah works for me so uh let's see what else like the news we don't watch because they're boring no unless i watched through the war you know there's only one yeah especially the war i mean it was like i haven't i seen this episode before you know i know i guess they think that people don't watch TV but i mean if you watch it like five minutes then it repeats the same thing over and over and over yeah i know it's like oh man and and in North Carolina see the the the thing is like here they just they just give you like local news okay like a house burned down in this little town and were here and i go so what happened worldwide you know yeah oh it's like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they're not going to tell you you know they're going to spend more time on doing a a thing on a on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know yeah so but uh let's see what else oh we watch like for example uh okay do you watch Star Trek uh i haven't seen it in years but i used to okay well i used to hate Star Trek yeah i thought i thought like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it uh-huh but then we started watching it and and like the new ones are pretty cool because because they got like uh like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind really oh really that's cool because what happened is like they have this hologram right where you walk in and you can program and everything looks real and you can touch everything and stuff but it's only a program and it's really great because sometimes it's like uh-huh are you serious oh man the hologram makes up all these things and uh i mean sometimes sometimes it's funny sometimes it's not but uh you know it's something to pass the time until we do and then and then we watch football that's cool kind of like Pink Floyd or something uh yeah basketball's cool but football kind of after a while which basketball which basketball yeah i kind of like college better it's more spirited college or well we got we got two teams of the ACC going there oh yeah we got Duke and North Carolina cool but i mean the i mean there's nothing to do like for example yesterday uh-huh uh they go some some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right uh-huh i hear no we're just you know it's like we just woke up we had a hangover and everything you know and so we just woke up and uh we're watching TV and i go no today we're just going to dedicate ourselves to watching golf golf yeah and bowling you know and everybody was like it was like oh God do you guys really watch that no you know i was like a whole golf tournament it's like for example baseball i hate baseball i mean oh me too somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball and the actual play time that there is is five minutes uh-huh because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it's hit yeah yeah okay and that takes like you know five seconds for the whole play that's true yeah that's true and that's it it i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know but i mean it's it's like that i mean it's was it's just but when i went home that's all like they had on TV so i had to i watched entire games of baseball and they're going oh my God and TV in Argentina's really bad oh really oh really so so why from Argentina why'd you come over here uh because um i wanted to go to school here oh that's cool how long did you live there yeah they have better computer science up here than they than they do down there oh so and i also uh my father works for IBM and we came up here we well we came to the United States in nineteen seventy six seventy seven uh-huh uh-huh yeah and uh we lived here for about seven years then we moved back and so then i said i'm going to move back up there to go to college huh he goes okay so he goes but do it fast so i did my undergraduate in two years yeah that's cool oh really awesome so but it's it's just you know oh well we've been talking for five minutes that's the only obligation we have that's cool groovy and uh well tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks yeah no doubt okay okay all right nice talking to you yeah you too bye-bye bye okay all right uh feelings on what caused the S and L crisis i guess i don't have a real technical knowledge for what happened i gather that there where large numbers of situations where loan were made that appear to be a good loan but in a speculative since and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during the Reagan eight years uh more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued um-hum kind of like a domino's effect right i don't have a a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome no uh scandal are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever no no uh i vaguely recall but i've never gone and done any study on it since the S and L thing that teapot dome scandal is when i think during the Hoover years where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration i don't have a real since of of like corruption that caused S and L all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sour um-hum no i don't think it was really corruption that caused it maybe or within i think people just started you know not not being as careful with the loans that they were making whenever you you know whenever they gave them out uh-huh i think maybe they didn't check into them enough or maybe because everyone else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so yeah yeah it it seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business decisions on a get rich quick is is the wrong phrase but if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the people making business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back i'll move on to this other company or um-hum um-hum i i just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were were making the decisions for and i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move um-hum you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't weren't stuck to where they were and as the things begin to collapse they just moved on i'm not sure or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they didn't they didn't care any more i i just i'm rather puzzled about the whole thing um-hum i know well i'm um i know a little bit about it but i don't as much as i should know about it i'm a finance major here at Clarion it okay and um i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a a hundred thousand dollars so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars and i think that's kind of why they they were making the riskier loans because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it well they didn't they didn't have a since of risk no i don't think so oh okay and uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan and like some banks you know they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make uh-huh and i think the S and L's were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make okay and i think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i don't think this would have happened well do you think we there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and nickels but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that that they really do understand how much money it is for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of the damage uh did is your since that we now understand how bad it is um-hum or is there more to be heard yet um i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it and it wasn't making it was wasn't as good news as it was i think it's still adding you know adding up and i think it will be for awhile so you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet or whether or no i don't i don't think they do i don't think how i don't think how they could find that big how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some S and L's still open uh-huh and it's and it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this to be caught in the land slide um-hum um-hum um-hum do you think to possibly is that it'll happen with the regular banks i i don't know i think i think it would be harder but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it it seems that i recall reading for the last oh let's say starting three years ago but not so much in the last year of bank risks of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico Venezuela um-hum uh and Argentina based on oil loans and then the price of oil had had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans i have this vague since that that could happen that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost oh yeah um in some of my classes now i was just reading i think it was in Venezuela i can't remember what company it was but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back um-hum you know and they just they just wrote it right off i think i think we've lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back it's impossible to get it back and so you think that it's just gone um-hum um-hum yeah because we're we're you know we're talking about some peens that have just like even gave up on getting it back they're even trying any more okay they just totally wrote it off their book do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program like my since is that was there to try to protect small investors but it ended up protecting big investors hum which i don't think what it was meant to do so i guess it i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exists for for these sorts of of problems um-hum um yeah i think is it necessary to have um the backing um it it's it's just for you know safe purposes you know in case something would happen um yeah as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to ha ve something um so your since is that the that uh the the loan guarantees which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money um-hum right and given that the S and L's have had disasters then those account holders are are their money is still being protected um-hum and that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of um-hum of dollars being protected it it seems like um there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts uh it's if if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred billion billion dollars and we're taking about monies way in access of that now so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts um-hum and perhaps multiple people in multiple S and L's and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought yeah you know that the for i guess i'm content with the need to have protection on on accounts but i feel likes it's on an individual basis someone whose got um-hum accounts in thirty five different S and L's or thirty or forty thousand dollars and they're all protected by the government seems to me like they've gotten around what was intended to be the issue there uh-huh i guess i don't have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i was not a heavy user of any S and L's and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt um-hum and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again because that means i'm not worried enough i think it could happen yeah uh it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive and then i then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things um-hum i think it'll happen again but i think it'll be a long time in the future before it does happen again because i think like the bank people and any kind of people like that are gonna be worried about it and not to let it happen again in the near future but i think later on they're gonna start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans i mean you're gonna have to take some risks and as long as they're backed i think they're still gonna you know start taking on riskier loans and i think there is a chance it could happen again but not until you know late you know in the future uh-huh well perhaps if there are regulatory um constraints put back in place um-hum it will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation uh do you are you on a regular regular exercise program right now yes and i hate it how about you oh well i'm kind of off and on off and on well i guess i've been kind of off and on i've um right now i'm kind of off had some health problems that have led me to uh stay more on than off okay what type of exercise do you do uh i do walking on the treadmill and then i do low impact aerobics okay i guess you don't enjoy that very much not not really you find that uh to be boring yeah yeah and time consuming i mean it's it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming it's uh you know afterwards you know then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know yeah well i'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring i know you go through this this is something you go through like every year but i yeah i haven't decided whether you're whether i wanna play yet or not i just bought myself a solo flex machine i don't know if you've seen those advertised on TV hum-um it's one of those uh universal type machines exercise machine but i haven't really sat down and used it much yet so it's collecting dust right now yeah a lot of things do that i have a negative i had an exercise bike i used to have one and finally got rid of it because i never used it but i do use my treadmill i used to jog somewhat uh-huh well that's good yeah my parents have a treadmill it's when i go visit them uh i'll get on that thing every now and then yeah it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't you don't have any excuse um-hum no i just got the bicycle out today and it was real nice outside had to get out to do something yeah i can't ride a bike so i been sitting in here uh in the house all weekend with a cold so i thought i'd better uh better get outside and do something and not waste the day oh yeah it's too nice been too nice of a weekend but uh yeah i need to start jogging again i've always found that to be uh uh really one of the best forms of exercise but it's terribly boring and so i really don't ever keep a a program up consistently uh you had any injuries from jogging no i never have well i don't jog enough i think to develop any injuries i usually only go about a mile or two i guess what worries me about jogging is that i hear that it's very hard on your body and and that you know you can end up getting hurt worse yeah it's it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt supposed to be much better if you find uh grass or or uh dirt to jog on um-hum yeah that's not quite so so easy yeah yeah have to have the right type of uh shoes too that's very important i found that true especially for walking on toes or fronts but yeah i don't have to buy jogging shoes all too often mine don't get very much use well i guess mine breakdown about they say about every six months uh-huh so ah i usually enjoy the exercise i do but uh like i said i'm just not very consistent about maintaining a a program so i'll i'll bicycle i get into that for for a little while and maybe go out and uh on a consistent basis every couple a days and ride a bike for awhile but then i'll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out three or four nights a week but uh that gets old too in a very short order i'm i'm hoping that this uh solo flex will uh yeah uh change things a little bit i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis yeah well don't let it collect dust you least exercise while dusting it off yeah well so maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this spring i can uh start some type of uh regular program yeah that that'll be good i've always found that that when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going um-hum uh when i was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education courses on exercise and uh one of those involved a six week session on a universal machine lifting weights and uh working out like that oh and that was very helpful and we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently uh increased the amount of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks um-hum i found that to be uh very helpful so are you gonna do that uh i need to i haven't started yet but it's a thought well that sounds like something good to do then sounds like something i should do yeah nice way to start off the spring uh-huh get back in shape how often do you uh uh go out each week on your walking well i do i switch every other day one day i walk and one day i do the aerobics okay how far about how far do you go walking well i'm trying build up my tolerance now i just surgery um less than two months ago and right now i'm just a little over about a mile and a half but i try try to workup to three miles okay yeah that's good well they say that walking is just as good if not better than jogging yeah it takes it's just that it takes longer to get the same effect yeah but it sure well if you keep up a a consistent pace just to keep the heart rate going uh my walkman broke so i'm upset now i just have to turn the stereo up real loud yeah yeah but it's a lot less stressful on the joints than jogging is yeah it is and it this has an you know my treadmill has an incline and you know you can get a really good workout on it um-hum do you go to an aerobics class or do you watch on TV no i i just do it on TV i have a cassette okay which uh shows do you watch on TV um it's just a it's a tape i use tapes oh okay okay like a Kathy Smith workout or Jane Fonda Richard or Richard Simmons Sweating to the Oldies okay right i will every every now and then i'll watch uh ESPN i i get cable on TV and they have uh a couple of shows called Basic Training and um what is the other o ne called uh-huh there was one guy i used to watch on ESPN i don't know if he's still on it anymore or not i don't i don't know if i get ESPN or not uh-huh but um well yeah i used to watch one watch one on the air but that was back Bodies In Motion that's that's the name of the one i was thinking of that was yeah with Gil Janklowicz yeah yeah i watched that cause he was cute yeah well he's he's he he he's not bad and his assistants usually aren't either but uh they're always in in in Hawaii someplace on on the on the beach yeah yeah but then that was back when um you know the high impact and yeah well they they do low impact stuff now they're on everyday do they are they yeah okay they're so they're still he's still doing it then huh oh i'll have to tune in yeah every morning it's on ESPN uh at what time i can't remember what time it's uh well i can't remember offhand what time i'll have to check it check check it back up then but the thing is is everybody always looks so good on there show least on some of the other ones not everybody has a picture perfect body they have that show on yeah every now and then um-hum well i found that they they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on TV i haven't watched any other ones on TV um just on some of the tapes so they're on weekdays at eleven o'clock everyday Monday through Friday i'll have to okay thanks case you're interested in that i actually taped a few of the sessions that they had on there but uh i haven't done so much as uh watch the tape that i made now that's a thought well that's a thought i hadn't thought about doing that so i'm kind of bad about that myself well they're gonna beep us pretty soon okay well i sure enjoyed talking to you about uh exercise and fitness uh-huh nice talking to you okay thanks talk to you later bye so all right good night bye why do you think so few people vote then why do i think so few people vote i i think a lot of it is uh apathy um um for example uh when things are going good i think the voter turnout is less just because people figure why bother you know what's the difference especially when two candidates seem roughly equal um and in others cases you know they they see themselves as one voter in a million and they think what difference is it going to make whether i vote or not they they feel like one vote doesn't have an impact um-hum and i think a lot of cases like a lot of our minority issues the we had the ten four one verses the fourteen one election here in Dallas a while back and it lost well that was decided by a very small margin um and there were a lot of of minorities that wanted it to go the way that it didn't go but they also had very low voter turnouts especially like in the Hispanic community and i think in that case they've just they developed a distrust of the system and so they've chosen not to participate in it um-hum and i think that's part of it what part what part would you say the big brother aspect plays the people that don't want to be called for what do you think jury duty or or things that they've heard that says you know well they use this registration for this purpose or that so they just don't bother oh i've i've heard people say that i know it's it's a real thing and i think it makes a difference as to how many people vote apparently not being a citizen not not serving on jury duty is important enough to them that they don't want to have any say in uh politics hum okay and then what about the smaller election say some of the city elections uh even down to the uh school board type uh elections i guess there are so many that you can uh weed out the ones that you really want to partake in yeah yeah well last November was my first election in Dallas i've only lived in Dallas a little over a year and i went down this long list of judges that i was voting for and i mean i didn't know anything about any of these races i didn't know what the responsibilities of the judges were i didn't know anything about the individuals who's names were on the ballet and i'm going you know how can i possibly make an informed choice here um-hum so what's the point in voting for these people i i mean it you know i get just as good of results as if i through darts at a board right well it's a shame that uh that even the politician who wants to give give out good information about himself uh has trouble in virtually everything he does say that's positive or or even mediocre gets attacked from the other side such that he spends more of his time defending than he can putting forth any decent information uh and then once you get off the candidate's personal information then you want to get into an actual issue and then how the candidate feels about that um-hum there's there's very little room for or very little time to handle all the different things you'd like to know about a candidate and then unfortunately after you do get some of that information you may find out it weren't true to begin with so yeah you you think then that uh part of it is because the uh it flashes too much on the personal uh characteristics of the candidate rather than his uh job performance issues i would say that it's much easier to deal with the the the public the uh media that's that's giving the information to the public is much easier to deal with uh any personality quirk or any negatives that they've found or any skeleton in the closet um-hum than to try and first educate the public to the point where they can listen to either side of a given issue yeah uh and it's pretty difficult to deal with some of the issues lets say that Texas uh Texas State uh Railroad Commission has to solve when you don't even fathom what the implications are of they're decision so who would you care who got in that position you know i'd i'd say yeah i'd say there's a large number especially of urban young voters that don't know what the Railroad Commission does right and so they go you know who who who what does it matter who i vote for right i think well that's one thing i've noticed i've i've lived a couple of different places i've noticed Texas seems to have more elective offices than any place i've ever been so hence more apathy i guess or confusion well a lot more confusion you know i in in other towns i've never called upon to decide all this long list of judges i've never been called upon to decide you know we're we're voting for Railroad commissioner and and uh Land commissioner and that sort of thing and in other state these would be appointments of the governor um-hum we wouldn't be expected to cast a ballet on the subject hum boy that makes the governor's vote a whole lot more important doesn't it well it does yeah a lot more appointee's i guess makes him carry a lot more weight um-hum but it also means you've got a unified state government you don't have different departments pulling against each other that's probably well worth it then it probably be worth it just to do away with the cost of the elections and uh put it in the hands of maybe one man who can at least get his party together yeah yeah so hum the the the big problem i guess with the the mass media is you know uh you don't have time to educate the public on these matters because the public is not going to sit still and soak the message in um-hum i mean anything that can't be covered in thirty seconds or less they're not going to care about it right or or if you can't dramatize it and put it on Unsolved Mysteries then they're not going to you know they're not going to want to hear it do you find it convenient to vote the actual time of day type where you have to go and the line you have to stand in uh the the line what i waited maybe ten minutes in line it was it was uh a minor inconvenience it was certainly worth it to me i think did you go early in the morning or i went right after work so that was when the line is the longest after work hum that's interesting well where in my little district fortunately it is literally across the street i could walk over there as it were we live across from the school and so we uh-huh i drive out of my complex early in the morning and go over there usually before the polls even open and and vote right at the you know number one or two sometimes the third or fourth person in in line um-hum and i wait longer to to watch them set up than i do actually in the in the line itself but that gets me out of there at a time that i can go down Central and not be bothered by the the traffic as it were yeah because normally i'm i'm at work before seven so uh just stay a little later that as it were and and make the the effort to vote uh but unfortunately since there are so many other things that uh our city wants to vote on hum they don't they they tend to make the elections if it's a not important election as it were they only open a few of the poles so i don't always i don't always vote at the same place so it's a little bit more trouble for me to well this election's going to be held this date and i've got to go over here so you have to go a little out of your way huh yeah yeah and i've got to remember uh you know on this election i'm in this district in this election i'm for here and uh you know this precinct votes here um-hum and i would just assume in holding still and all vote in the same place as many times as they want yeah yeah i would also like better information on on what on you know what am i voting on and and who just some general statements about the candidates i guess this is the kind of thing you expect from the newspapers um-hum and i didn't see much of it like you know i see you saw a lot about the major races but a lot of the minor ones that you're being called upon to decide there's very little information on um-hum as far as you know what what is the duties of this political office and uh and what are the characteristics or what what are the issued statements and uh spoken goals of the uh candidates right i'd like to get probably wouldn't even hurt to have a section that says here's how this particular office affected you or could have affected you over the last several years you know these are the kinds of decisions that this particular judge or this particular uh Railroad Commission for instance does yeah if if you know if he he does do something or you pay attention to this or this is the guy to to blame for this if uh you didn't like what happened um-hum you are right there is no uh no such deal other than the small publication that uh uh League of Women Voters puts out it supplements that newspaper that i get a local newspaper they they published but uh nothing per se in the major newspaper and as hungry as they are for things to print you'd think they'd want to do that yeah well they the Dallas Morning News did publish a a section that covered the major races and it explained a lot to me about the individual candidates and helped me make a lot of better informed decisions but still uh you know it it left a lot of the the the local races the races unique to my precinct uh up in the air there is one thing that that did annoy me and that is the the my congressman last fall didn't have anybody running against him so basically i had no choice um-hum and i think uh in some districts you know there's a a party one party or another that has such a lock on it that uh you know why vote when it's decided already right that sort of attitude that's true with so many elected officials i guess there's just so many people to go around in some of those cases yeah hum well i hear someone calling me so i better let you go well we used the five minutes up yeah at least bye okay all right bye okay capital punishment oh i honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion in the way that it's applied or that it's applied at all uh-huh applied at all so i how do you feel that it should be applied well i just i just feel like there's a lot of murderers and rapists and everything else just walking the streets you know and that that the penalty ought to be out there and be enforced yes yes not getting paroled lets say in so many years i mean if your going to sentence somebody lets say twenty years let them stay twenty years yes that's i agree with that completely i know we don't have enough prisons but there has got to be some kind of punishment for these people there has that's right because if they turn around they can get away they get away with it and they get away with it and they get away with it and then they do something worse and they get a slap on the wrist they get thirty days in jail and they finally get up to where they kill somebody else and they go through fourteen appeals and uh-huh yeah yeah uh-huh how many hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars that's right that's honestly right and it's they have really got it better than we do in a lot of ways you know well they certainly are living off our expense at our expense but they sure are just because some innocent person can really it seems like really serve a rough time you know i'm not saying innocent person let's say someone wrote a hot check for instance i didn't yes you know it seems like when they go to prison it they really seem like it's a rough time for them and a murderer well go to prison oh he's just there to serve his time and get back out on the street um-hum and and be paroled and and have served the sentence that's what that's what people face with that choice one thing i really hate is they don't explain to the jurors in a in a trial on a capital murder trial or in yes cases of rape or in different things that are so horrible what it means when they sentence them to you know they'll sentence them to ninety years and say that it's you know that it's going to you know that should be life but instead in in given the choice of either sentencing to death or sentencing to life they'll give them ninety years in prison or something uh-huh and then turn around in thirty years that you know and less they're out uh-huh even if if they're even in that long or they appeal and then they get an appeal that says it was you know an unjust amount of time it was an extraordinary long length or something time uh-huh yes i just i would just be i would love to see them just really get real strict on parole yeah you know i'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent i think people know that nobody that it doesn't you know it it's not a deterrent right now because it's not really effective uh-huh there's should be you know this for this crime this is the penalty you killed someone you know in cold blood or whatever this is what's going to happen um-hum yeah you get it back yeah yeah and i mean it sounds horrible it i i hear myself saying this and but i don't know what else to do with some of these people that are because they let them back out again and they do the same thing over and over again then they put them back in jail and they get out and and more and more innocent people are hurt or killed but it's i i know yeah same thing yes yes uh-huh and these guys just are on the endless merry-go-round in the legal system uh-huh and it's like i said at our expense uh a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it because it hasn't happened to them which it hasn't to me either you know thank goodness but still it it could yes i know i you read about it in the paper every day somebody who's done this or that yes something really horrible and they just get away with it and nothing happens uh-huh and as far as the other states i honestly don't know what their capital punishment is you know i i haven't kept up you know anything like that yeah i think i think Texas is what Texas the southern states seem to be somewhat more conservative and still have the death penalty and i think i know California had it for a long time and then they um took it off the books they repealed it uh-huh and people like Charles Manson and and some of these other people who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty were sentenced to life in prison and are now now that even though California has reinstated the death penalty for whatever various crimes the people who were there originally when they when they changed the laws to revoke the death penalty are still in there for are in prison in quote for life and and are now coming up for parole some of them like Manson who's come up um-hum you know it's been denied fortunately but but yes but still it came up though didn't it i mean you know yeah well the jury that originally sentenced him sentenced him to death uh-huh and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal the state of California reverked revoked the law in the early seventies and then they reinstated it later but the penalty didn't go back you know uh-huh it seems like a lot of times the law is is totally on the criminal side and and isn't protecting the rest of the people yes the victim is really seems like left out in the cold more or less doesn't it in a lot of well especially in things you pick up the paper and you read you know you think oh my goodness um-hum yeah and the the laws are all the rules some of the things that would make sense to to tell the jury that this this guy has a a prior criminal history you know where he's raped ten women uh-huh and then he gets up for this one trial and they don't find anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again uh-huh and so they say well this is you know i i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever but they give him a lighter sentence thinking he's not a habitual criminal or you know plead insanity yeah well you know and a lots of things to some extent if they would do something with some of those people but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too oh yes i think yeah uh-huh they plead insanity and then three years later they're cured and let loose on society again yes i it just just doesn't make sense i just i mean it's a it's a scary world out there anymore where your afraid to go out i know in in the Dallas metroplex area i don't go out hardly if i don't have to at night by myself uh-huh and i i certainly i i grew up in a smaller town in Texas and it wasn't that way when i was younger uh-huh well like i said i live in a small place you know we could go around and boy but uh even the small towns now though has really changed from when i was a kid but now i'm raising children it just it really is yes ever you can't even when i was a kid i would run between my neighbors three and four blocks sometimes and as long as my mom had a general idea where i was and i was back on the time and now i don't let my kids out of the front yard that i can't see them uh-huh see them yep yeah it really is well we're probably fixing to run out of time pretty soon but i've enjoyed talking to you um-hum well good talking to you too bye bye bye okay bye-bye okay so what are your opinion on it well let me preface it i'm a i was a staff officer in Vietnam in sixty nine and seventy um-hum and i'm in active reserve now so uh i'm probably not going to have the opinion you think i would have um-hum um it's it was an interesting in that i think that he gave the American people some uh uh a sense of the fact that that uh wars are really run by politicians um-hum uh i are you old enough to remember the war not not much i'm twenty eight so no i really don't remember anything about it i guess i was about ten when it ended right yeah uh i was born in sixty two so when did it end well December seventy two was when uh we bombed North Vietnam and and they released the prisoners in early seventy three so that that time frame yeah so i was ten and i don't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in great detail i think the the significant thing is is today did did you uh did you see Barbara Walters interview with Schwartzkopf no i didn't well they but i i did read the book i have do have i have six years of college so i did read and study about the Vietnam War though so i am pretty familiar you know i'm more familiar with it than well what what's your perspective on it mine i think uh i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to you know just leave their freedoms there and to you know get rid of some of the atrocities that were going on i don't i don't know i don't really i'm tired of pacifist though see on the other hand i'm a pacifist i'm really struggling with it i'm a pacifist physical pacifist i'm a Christian and i believe that the real warfare is not with Saddam Hussein or the North Vietnamese but it's in spiritual kingdoms and that the real warfare is done you know in your prayer closet on your knees so in a way in a sense i'm a pacifist but i'm really not you know what i'm saying yes i don't think just lay back and not do anything i think lets go to war but let's go to war praying and let's go to war for that way so well well the difficulty i have is that uh are we our neighbor's keepers um-hum and this is what i find particularly difficult in that uh if we see injustice and whether it's in a uh you know Chicago or uh or or Dallas i i think if we see it you know we see John Wiley Wiley Price hollering injustice i think that's wrong now the question is is was there injustice in Vietnam or was there injustice in Iraq and Kuwait um-hum um-hum um-hum the difficult i point is is to where do we step in and and i think that we yeah that's that's the part i have difficulty and the the other part is that the the when when your when your when you're looking at Vietnam and you say well is fifty eight thousand lives worth it and i don't know that anything is worth fifty eight thousand lives um-hum still have a problem with uh you know i haven't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this but and i know other Christians would disagree with me my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this but we don't fight over it or anything but you know how can you know the Bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you and it's like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind so it's like how can you i don't know for me i don't know you know i can't say that i agree with Vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and and then shoot them well the other issue is is is how do you allow uh how how do you allow injustice just like the the policeman in in Los Angeles you so um-hum how could how could could you stand there and watch them beat that guy if your brother or your sister were being beaten um-hum by the authorities do we step in well in some cases we would and i i think that's what makes it so difficult yeah it is a difficult thing but then vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord and i will pay so i think God ultimately in charge of what goes on in i know like Mao Tse Chung in China he did all these terrible things and they were terrible and he's gonna be accountable for them and but if you look back you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he tore down all the temples he he unified the Chinese language it was impossible for missionaries to do accomplish anything in China but because of all that and so even in North and South Vietnam i bet you'd see the same thing and that now he build roads so then he'd open and then he dropped dead twenty five years premature he just dropped dead and so something good did come out of that in that now you see what i mean it's like now yeah but but the other the other difficulty is is that it's just if if you take the admonition to to feed my sheep uh-huh and the question is who are my sheep and the idea do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry well bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him if he if he needs your asks for your shirt give him your coat also so if the the the the South Vietnamese they asked us to help them right but is that right yes uh they did the i think the the biggest difficulty is is that when your at an agrarian economy like South Vietnam was that in reality uh the the poor farmer poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes um-hum um-hum and the question is who was he going to pay it to yeah uh the Communists or the uh alleged Democrats uh democratic form of government and i uh-huh i think that's i think i think uh that's a little was a difficult part there and and i we didn't understand the culture we couldn't uh we had uh we had a a young lady that was fourteen that worked in our in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old and and the people looked like children i mean you couldn't imagine that one would would would conceal a bomb and um-hum yeah and and do these kind of things i think culturally it really destroyed a lot of the people that that went over and saw these people you just couldn't believe that they would that they would be mean and and and drop bombs and kill people and then we would turn around and and napalm them you know if um-hum um-hum and i think there was a lot of a lot of tearing of emotions and i think that if anything that when Schwartzkopf he was saying the idea that we learned we learned we learned a lot from Vietnam um-hum now it was it was it was in general bad but and i don't know the problem is now i'm i'm concerned a little bit that that now that the Gulf War is on that we're going to think it was a good war and it was okay yeah to go beat up on people and i think that i think we need to a little more justice at home i'm not sure how we get that whether there's a connection there but yeah but then again yeah i'd say it is wrong to invade Kuwait and i'm not saying President Bush made the wrong decision i think i'm lacking in my in any event i don't think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the Vietnam War because i'm going to interpret that through the Bible and i've kind of always i have been a Christian five years and i've kind of avoided that t hat those the war things and how God approaches that because i think its just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to come you know need to decide what i feel well the difficulty is is if you look in the Old Testament and and the numbers of places that uh the Lord went out and just simply struck down and that was part of the problem when they went into the Promised Land that they that they uh they didn't destroy everybody and that that's right right they left a woman and a child or the cat the sheep yeah and and that that you know and you i think that's one of those things when we get to Heaven we're going to ask God i know why did you do it that way but then again though Jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what i'm saying like so he didn't just say don't kill your don't kill your enemies but don't only don't kill them bless them you know and so therefore when we have an enemy come against us i really feel like but i really feel like i know i do feel this strongly that when if we had someone come and attack us the best way to handle it would be to bless them and humbly go to their other king or the other ruler and say what have we done to offend you what can we do to rectify this situation and that God would move in that sovereignly and he would get the glory though no king no Bush wouldn't what do you because it wouldn't make any sense you know what i'm saying it'd look absolutely ridiculously stupid but it would work out because yeah if you follow the scriptural principals it's going to work out because those are that's the best way to do it you know but the thing is is that then God gets the glory not a president not a king and i think that's a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory well and i i and even at the even at the local level when somebody's assaulted um-hum what do you do turn the other cheek no well i believe personally i hope i this is where everyone always says my husband always goes through that i go yeah for one if someone broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to to to take authority over that and i know people that have done that i mean i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes and just say i bind you in Jesus name your i just and rebuke any enemy because i believe it's a spiritual war that's going on and it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home illegally that's not normal there's something going on there and that i would have discernment by the Holy Spirit to be able to pray over that do you see what i mean and then the same in Vietnam you would you wouldn't handle Vietnam the same way you would handle uh Saddam Hussein yeah but i just i have a problem with all the killing but i'm not a new ager i don't believe means that i am not for one world government i'm not for all these new age things i i don't have a problem with uh national identity and i'm an American and having different nations and all of this but i am concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like God has a better way to handle it than that and so what do you think of uh public schools today well the problem we're having down here in public schools is is financing for one thing uh uh and and the uh the tax districts they're in the process of of rearranging the tax tax districts so they can't decide and uh some of the more rich schools are those are those schools that are financially well off are going to have to support those are aren't especially in the minority neighborhoods neighborhoods um and uh there's a lot of problems with that oh a lot of debate going on with that and and and the restriction is it sort of yeah restructuring sort of screwing screwing around with whoever is getting what money to what school right right yeah we actually don't have we have we're having some problems of own up here with teachers yeah but um we are we are apparently i'm i'm fairly new to Rochester i've only been here a couple a few years and we are supposedly Rochester public schools are are one of the model the city schools are some of the models for the rest of the country yeah they have very specific programs that um that are being implemented at the moment that everybody is watching you know to make sure that they're all they're all working and uh for instance they have a mentor teacher program where um there are teachers who take a year off or so and gets to go around and and help other teachers learn how to teach yeah and things like that but they're having a lot of problems here because um because they also pay the teachers i think much better than others places in the country yeah that's a problem down here it's uh they they pay them well uh not no not too well oh yeah they there they pay them a little better here i think than most than than than than the national average especially these mentor teachers yeah yeah but they're having a large problem negotiating contracts they have been in contract they have been without a contract i believe for over six months or something like six months yeah and they are now putting in you know some sort of federal arbitrator i think or something because they just have a horrible time getting the you know getting their contracts straightened out they have been good and they only walked out once or twice i believe they keep getting you know they they'll go all the way to your table they'll have some proposal and then yeah someone won't like it for some reason or some of them will say vote it down and it just goes but yeah i think uh someone that really wanted it or i really don't understand or i guess i do understand people that i guess that want to teach teach it's it must be inborn in them or something because they're certainly not going into it for the for the money nor the prestige or whatever yeah so that that's that that's always i'm i'm actually i'm a PhD student at the moment yeah and um it's always occurred to me that that um you know i mean so looking at it so all so i have some bias in this yeah but it but it's always seemed to me that that those people who should be paid the most i think or paid significantly you know significantly more are are teacher types because they sort of hold for of the future in our hands than almost anyone else yet yet i don't think that uh it it it's being done i also i mean in general i think that our educational system is okay but i think we're lacking in some very specific areas yeah that that need to be worked on i will i think one thing too that's hurting the teachers as far as recruiting teachers is that the uh they've lost a lot of their their authority in the classroom yeah how what do what do you mean by that well i mean uh they no more punishment per se oh yeah i i'm speaking mostly of elementary um-hum uh you know it's if some if a teacher does anything that uh they're liable to have a law suit against them for for uh cruel and unjust punishment or whatever that's true that's true it's uh but well i think that and of course you've got the drugs and the uh other problems that you were much more prevalent than when i was going to school yeah i think actually in any there are some places where some teachers are just afraid to teach you know are they going to or they go to work where they're just baby sitters i think rather than teachers you know they're job is to make sure that no kids get killed in their classroom for that day and yeah nobody else get's out so it's hard to imagine a you know i mean i i i can't imagine teaching in a situation like that and actually trying to get anything across to a student yeah i'd be more concerned about getting myself out alive at the end of the day and just being happy so i i sit back that the that's one of the main things that sort of happens to be sure up you know in or educational system maybe i do that means you have to have a metal detector and and uh outside the school or something yeah i'm not sure and uh also you know this is purely my my thoughts because i am i'm a Christian and i think when they took prayer out of school that uh uh i think it hurt well possibly i think it does um i'm not sure i think it does some uh it it it it may sort of lead to some uh it it it may just be another form of sort of regimenting you know in kids which i which i think is good actually to have some kids sort of sit together and you know just say things and sort of do things together so possibly yeah possibly i think that um uh i'm i'm i'm actually Jewish so i suspect that i would be more in favor of sort of nonsectarian sort of prayer yeah in school but i think some things might be a a wise idea just to give kids more of an authoritarian sort of view yeah i think a lot of kids are having a problem with that today i would would i would agree with you and uh and i think somewhat although i do understand the issue of separation of church and state somewhat so i yeah yeah i do too but uh so i don't know how you resolve that you know i also i mean i think that our i think that our schools look a lot worse nowadays yeah relative to schools sort of in other countries as well like compared to the Japanese school system i was in a panel that would that addressed the issue of you know science and how our kids they're just very very far behind of science because a lot of them just aren't going into it because they just don't know anything about it and how it's got to be upgraded now is all well i i believe in freedom of but not freedom from if you understand what i mean i think so you i i i read a little bit on that that that sounds interesting right but uh we've like i say we've been redistricting here in Dallas has been a a major issue for i guess the last year oh well hopefully they'll resolve it soon yeah they uh they the voters voted one way and it and then uh some federal judge said no that was unconstitutional and they have had two or three votes and the city council is divided over what the district should be because they divide it one way and the minorities say we're losing representation representation and uh it it's just a big battle well i hope it all works out but uh yeah i i i have i mean you say that your your kids are grown up and out of school now and i've yet to have any so yeah yeah so i'm not quite at home with the issues yet yeah but i'm sure i'll it will hit me a little harder in a couple of years yeah and also the cost of it you know not not not great not uh public school but i can't imagine having to raise a kid now and and have to look to college oh i can't even i can't imagine it uh in the next you know fifteen years or so later they go it's going up my only hope is that uh is that whatever i'm going to wined of being college faculty somewhere i think yeah and my and my only hope is that um whatever kids we have want to go to school wherever i teach yeah because that typically is very otherwise i can't imagine it yeah i i just don't see how a person could it would could put enough away enough money out of their paychecks to pay for our kids schooling within fifteen years no i i i don't i it completely beyond me i went to my under graduate uh education yeah um on a lot of financial aid and where i am now i'm i'm only in graduate school because they waive tuition and yeah they pay for school a little bit otherwise i would never yeah most kids is probably just going to have to do what i did be comfortable again either course the service i'm at i don't think gives a education uh after service well they give some some financial aid for education they they advertise that they give it you can earn up to ten or twenty thousand dollars for yeah but uh that's how i got my my education such as it was was going into it is service and then coming back coming out in three years and getting uh two years paid for that's that's actually a great way i think i know i have lots of friends who are doing things like that yeah i think it's a great way i couldn't i'm actually deaf in one ear so they wouldn't take me yeah yeah um but that is a real a real i mean that's a real good way to do it i think i think that you know these people are sort of getting the money and doing something for it so yeah i think it's real good anyway it's it's been it was nice meeting you okay and i'm i'm glad to have met you oh are are work with Texas Instruments and no i'm not i'm just like you a person on the uh phone oh okay i was wondering thing i guess this is not just Texas Instruments wide cause i worked for Texas Texas Instruments that that's oh no well my family moved to Texas about eight years ago my husband was raised here but i i have never lived here so um when when we came back to Texas i i was really kind of excited there wasn't a state income tax and there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the grocery store and things and all of that was new to me so um-hum i'm sort of feeling like we're getting a better deal here than what i was accustomed to yeah well did you move from the the Northeast well i lived in Missouri and then in Utah and then um and both places had pretty good state income tax um-hum and um we've always paid tax um you know on everything we purchased you know even food at the grocery store so i thought it was really you know kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries groceries and but i think i mean i i don't enjoy paying taxes and it's hard but um i think that's what we have to have to you know have our streets and and have our government and excuse me and have and have the services that we need and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and and things like that and i think i guess what i feel is that most people um they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like well there's some people who aren't paying their fair share yeah i think yeah it's the people that can really influence the government and have all the money to and um that makes you feel bad right and you know when um when last year the the elections were going on the governors election and state and you know i i didn't have anything against um Clayton Williams personally or anything but um it was kind of hard for me to think here's someone who as wealthy as he is didn't have to pay any income tax that he said that year he claimed he had didn't have to pay income tax and he thought well you know there's some people are living pretty pretty good life styles but they're not paying income tax and that's not fair to me and there's you know some people who uh are abusing no the systems that we pay taxes to support and all of that makes us feel bad but i think you know all in all how i feel is that um i'm willing to pay the taxes because i think i like our country compared to the other countries i've studied and visited and um i'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services i enjoy how do you feel well yeah i agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get and i think that you know i don't think there's probably any really um-hum put that system that everybody would think is fair as far as being taxed you know i guess in Texas with uh we live here also um-hum um-hum and that it's mostly sales tax so it's really the people that have the money to buy things that are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff i've lived in Texas most of my life we um lived in Kansas City for a couple of years and um-hum we were kind of in for a rude awakening they had personal property taxes on like cars and the first year we're there it was like eight hundred dollars and we're like uh-huh oh no you know what happened is my husband said i used to complain to pay sixty dollars to get licensed in Texas and now you know so i mean that was kind of different and then to file a uh-huh a state income tax was also kind of tough too um i guess since we've been married we've moved a lot and so it always seems like you know we're always paying in taxes for something and so the it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little bit of money back but um-hum i um have accounting background so then i also have done tax returns in the past and for other people when i worked for accounting firm uh-huh and uh you know it is kind of sad to see all these people that you know have the resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put their money in places they don't have to pay taxes or to buy something that loses money so that they can right you know offset the income that they get or whatever so but you know i think if yes i can understand maybe why the rich people don't want to pay you know a large large percent because it you know that's not really fair either if they've earned their money um-hum by themselves well you know people just kind of given the money it's kind of depressing sometimes i think yes well it is and um and sometimes i think um well for myself that the income that we have we're paid a certain salary but i think the employer keeps in mind this'll be deducted you know some so many taxes will be deducted from it and so i think we're you know our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it and so i think you know in that way we're compensated yeah um just by our society yet you know they don't pay you um what just what it would take and then if if you pay taxes on it you wouldn't have any money left over and and um but some of the people that make a great deal of money and everything um i wish that they would i guess because i'm not one of them i wish that they would um you know realize that they well yeah that's true they couldn't make this kind of money they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else yeah in that even if they made that kind of money there's some countries that have like fifty percent income tax you know that have socialized medicines and things and that they um they wouldn't be able to enjoy the yeah uproots that and that so that you know they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it yes they've earned it and yes they've that's great they've you know had such great fortune here but they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do that somewhere else yeah um um i like Texas um not having the state income tax and i hope that because um you know that we've had enough industry here that i guess it is that why we don't the industry here is able to to um fund the state because we have oil here and things i mean that's what i've always heard is that um but they must have enough other stuff because the way the oil has been the last few years that that really hasn't been the industry that is bringing in the money for the taxes i wouldn't think big boom yeah there's something about um the industry in the state that um there's enough i know we moved here from Houston and um the city had it's enough money it was really nice that they had uh yeah but they began to cut back because of the oil problems but um you know they would have have um so many community outdoor theaters and and like uh community um-hum country club type things that the it was such nice services to offer the residents in the city and i really liked that don't you have to why people just kind of debate expect certain services then then they don't really think they should pay for them or something maybe i don't know um-hum yeah it's true and i'm you know like the the property tax that we pay and everything is so much higher than my parents pay in Missouri but um i'm i'm comfortable at least this year with we pay we have some good schools you know the school thing might be changing but yeah i'm i'm willing to pay for that for my children and i'm willing to sacrifice i guess i mean i'm not going to be the kind of person that's going to grumble about the taxes even though we're paying pretty high percentage um i feel like you get what you pay for and i want to be here and i i enjoy i enjoy living here in this country and having seen other countries i'd much rather live here and pay taxes than live somewhere else and um-hum and not anyway well i guess i better let you go well it was nice talking to you i haven't ever i need to i've never initiated one of these phone calls do you call in do you get to pick the subject or do they kind of yeah it was nice talking no no they just define it to you and so so you get what get uh luck of the draw but yeah anyway well good luck to you bye-bye oh i see yeah okay you too bye okay hi okay you wanna start hi um yeah sure um i think i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back if you can't pay for it you shouldn't have it period that is very true however our whole economy is based on loans and that's just um-hum uh uh but but right this moment you probably have several loans out or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something well master charge i don't have a master charge thank you but uh see that our whole system is built on on owing on borrowing right but that's the problem see as our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that uh true but uh uh uh without it people wouldn't be able to own automobiles or they wouldn't be able to own a house yes they would they just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i we're twenty eight if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford which we wouldn't be destitute i mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds but i feel like the generation after us would oh man it it would be so good it would be so much better it wouldn't be perfect but then they could learn to live with what what they could afford to save to buy and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer well now i agree uh i agree with you one hundred percent i'm just taking the other side just so we'll have a discussion uh-huh here uh but i still go right back to what i said when is the last time you had uh fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile but see i we made poor choices in college we took out two both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans for student loans um-hum and i look back on that and i bought shoes i went shopping i did not need that money i did not need it i didn't need it i shouldn't have even qualified to get it i didn't need it and it would have been a little rough i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but i did not need it and as i look back now now we're paying that back i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans don't do it and i don't i hope don't think he'll have to do that but i just so like we might if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and i believe we would have because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free and they pay cash for everything they buy uh-huh including new vans and so so i guess i've seen it done and i know you can do it you know but you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van and that's where Americans don't like to do it and so and we don't want to cut back our services from the government because we're spoiled well i have one way to suggest reducing the budget what very simple just take all these civil service employees and and uh uh take some of those holidays away from them like Columbus Day President's Day i mean they get they get all these days off now give them i know yeah what a a week i think we here at TI get a total of eleven a year i know um-hum and that's about uh three or four less than civil servants get uh-huh now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off all those holidays yeah that is true because i always think the mail never comes on these days and you're like well what is it you don't even know it's a holiday well now don't forget the mail is something else again that has nothing they're not civil servant people but isn't that federal in the federal budget no no they have their own budget they go by but isn't it part of our income it's not part of our taxes no you know that's why the price price of mailing a letter keeps going up it's not that's why it keeps going up huh that's another topic you know i could i can remember the days when it only cost three cents to mail uh uh uh a letter those stamps are valuable now yeah they probably hey i ought to go looking through some of my old mail that's funny yeah and that is a good short term thing though that little things like that that overall though i just think we're just going to i don't know see i know i guess i'm kind of leery of this topic because i know that Bush is real for the new world order the one world government and alleviating all you know national debt between all of the nations but i see that to be a potential power problem later with um who's going to be in charge with this new world order and i you know i'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place but i know we already have a new money system we already have new bills printed for the US Treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency and i mean i've seen them and so i know that the long-term vision for the US government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh but i'm concerned with whose going to have the power over this new world order that they keep talking about you know that's a lot of power for one or two people to have and so um i guess because i i guess i feel like i know what their long-term vision is i'm kind of like you know yeah the only answer is to start over or to totally change our lifestyles and i don't think Americans are willing to do it well what about uh uh sending all this money overseas supporting other governments third world governments how do you feel about that i don't i don't feel we should loan them money if i i wish our leaders were really seeking the Lord on these things and if we feel led to give a country money to help them fine but i don't feel we should be loaning money like that i mean it doesn't work are they gonna well in so many cases it's not a loan it's just a give a giveaway but it's not but it's not set up as a giveaway if it were set up as giveaway and it was something that i mean our our President and our leaders could be seeking God saying God is it your will for us to bless this nation with this money is it your will this money and your will for us to give to them and i believe if we gave it no strings attached that God would bless our nation but because we're our motive is interest our motive is not pure it just backfires i mean none of these nations have paid us back it be do you understand it's i guess it's a principle of giving and receiving you give it no strings attached and they may never give you anything back but because there's no strings attached it like gives them a freedom to give us something back and it might not be money it might be um no taxes on our things our computers going into their nation it might come back in another way but it would be come back bu t because we're loaning it i think that's the problem and i don't mean give it to everybody that asks use a lot of discernment don't give money to every nation you know what i'm saying i think we're loaning money to too many nations but i think if we gave to a few select ones that really needed it that it would work out better for us and for them and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money and so i just think we're never going to get that back you know do you understand no that that's true i i understand that France still owes us money from World War I um-hum and uh World War II debts have never been repaid i think the US just wrote them all off yeah and said well we'll cancel it just like they did to the that Polish debt here uh last week um-hum yeah uh uh half the countries in the world simply canceled the Poland debts to help them right long what long term though do you think it would be best to see an a one world you know you can't alleviate all national debts or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking God on how to turn our nation around financially that's my opinion my opinion's the latter uh-huh well uh i've got to respect your opinion you have some uh solid ideas um-hum i know but what's yours do you agree or do you disagree or i mean what do you think long term well i don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world um-hum uh that's asking for trouble people are too different um-hum i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the US and find tremendous differences between the peoples they have their own ideas how things should be run um-hum so therefore i don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world there's too many societies involved uh the language barriers um-hum uh oh sure they somebody said years ago well let's make it English uh an international uh language um-hum that's a big laugh we can't even make English a a national language here in our country um-hum we've got too many uh uh uh immigrants yeah yeah um they don't call them immigrants anymore that was back during my granddaddy's day yeah different ethnic groups a well yes yeah but uh yeah i know what you're saying my grandfather came over from Lithuania back uh just before the turn of the century um-hum and uh as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger uh-huh he uh was supposed to serve some time well he did serve his time in in the uh the militia uh-huh and he came back he was a civilian again and his father said well if you good morning uh hi you mentioned model railroading that uh i've been watching a program on the Public Broadcasting Station here uh about model railroading have you ever seen that yes i i always turn on the TV set and it seems like i catch that program in the last five minutes and uh well it's been very interesting i i think it you know what i see is fascinating and i kind of enjoy it uh i've always had that hobby ever since i was a child uh-huh and uh i refuse to get involved because i never had space for a permanent layout yeah and then here about five years ago we bought a big old house out in Oaktown Virginia and there was uh there was two basements wow there were two two separate furnace rooms and so i took the smaller furnace room and now it's full of trains you should have taken the larger one huh well uh my uh brother had a Lionel train set he was a a bit older than i and so when i came along i was interested in uh fooling with the train and since he was was past that stage why he didn't have any objections and uh in fact i started doing a layout uh in our garage at one time but i got about as far as sort of painting some uh streets and things on a piece of plywood and putting up a few things and it got to be hot summertime when i gave it up um but uh i've always enjoyed uh the train and you know fooling with it and all do you still have the uh train set he has it he has it yeah i mean since it was his i couldn't very well keep it forever um but uh actually i have had an idea not long ago uh hope to build another house some day and i was thinking i might uh incorporate some sort of a display space and ask him if he would let me put the train up you know not not as a working type of thing but just to put it on display uh-huh well those uh the early Lionels can be quite valuable yeah i don't know what year his was bought but probably around nineteen forty forty two maybe i'm i'm just guessing but something like that i would think yeah well some of those around the war years were uh kind of difficult to get a hold of because Lionel got involved in manufacturing a lot of uh uh war equipment uh-huh and uh i think they almost discontinued production uh in nineteen forty two and forty three oh really so some of the pre-war models are quite valuable yeah i don't know i don't know if i don't know if he knows i know there's some uh booklets and things you know showing different models and stuff that are quite old that were with it but i don't know if they were original or if they were picked up you know in later years well i managed to sweet talk my brother out of uh his Lionel train set that uh dated back to about nineteen thirty three um and uh he's kind of unhappy i've got it now but i'm not going to give it back yeah that's probably the way it goes sometimes and i had a uh post uh World War version of the Pennsylvania Electric uh GT1 locomotives and it happened to be one of the rare paint jobs oh so i understand that that locomotive is worth around seven hundred and fifty dollars now wow so it's it's sitting on display on top of my bookcase it has a prominent spot huh yeah well i think those things are neat and and as i say i watch that show and there are some uh really interesting museums around that uh have good displays and uh i said that well if i ever took a trip i you know might ignore some of these museums because a lot of them are called childrens museums or toy museums and um-hum that wouldn't really catch my attention but if i knew that they had you know really good train layouts i would wanna go and see what they had well Pennsylvania used to have uh some commercial displays there was one place that was halfway between Harrisburg and Allenstown Pennsylvania in a community called Midway which suggest it was halfway um and uh they had a huge room which was probably uh forty feet wide and a hundred and forty feet long uh and the central portion of that room was occupied by one huge O gauge layout running uh uh Lionel train and American Flyer trains wow huh and they had done a lot of work on that with uh scenery and buildings and they had trolleys running around and uh a lot of animation in there and uh it was in business for a long long time i don't know it it still maybe in business it might be yeah well um you mentioned another hobby sailing do you have a sailboat yes uh i bought a uh Bristol thirty five five for my wife um and we keep it on the Chesapeake Bay and uh starting next weekend i'm gonna have to go down and uh fill out for the summer season yeah we have a cruise plan to sail from uh Solomon to Maryland up to Philadelphia this summer uh-huh about a two week cruise and uh two or three lay days in Philadelphia oh that'll be nice they have a a new waterfront uh marina in Philadelphia it isn't as developed as uh Water Side in Norfolk or the Baltimore uh waterfront but uh the marina is only about uh two or three blocks from the historic district oh so that's quite uh handy for our our youngsters we can take them up and yeah show them Independence Hall the Liberty Bell and uh Franklin uh yeah and just be right there huh Franklin Square yeah well uh we're not uh really sailors but i want some summer soon to um hire a sailboat with a captain since we're not you know versed in that and uh go to the Caribbean um well there are some uh good opportunities for that in the British Virgins right yeah uh that's uh that is almost an ideal sailing area uh if you have a little even a little bit of experience uh i've seen a number of people go through a uh a cruising class in Annapolis uh-huh where they might get uh maybe ten or fifteen hours of sailing experience go down to uh uh British Tortolla and charter a boat for a week and they take it out and have a grand time yeah uh it's fairly sheltered waters right there and uh you don't need any fancy navigation equipment because you can see all your destinations from one spot right uh it just sound fascinating to me i would love to just go down i've always liked islands and water and that sort of thing anyway and um been on a couple of big cruise ships so uh you know i kind of had seen it from that point of view but i i think i would like the sailboat um-hum uh i've been there several times uh the first trip uh we flew down and uh chartered a uh Morgan uh forty five um and i had fun that then a few years later a guy i was racing with uh decided to take his boat down for a winter season and so i went offshore with him to uh Saint Thomas and then we cruised uh the American Virgins for a week before i flew home which do you think is best American or British Virgins i think the better sight seeing is in the uh British Virgins uh-huh uh there's uh some very nice places like the bass which is a uh sort of a huge monolithic rocks that you can you can walk up the beach and into these uh enormous caverns that are partially submerged and you can wade in the pools and so forth very popular tourist spot uh-huh uh the Bitter End is an excellent resort up in uh which is very easy to get into and there's some very nice reefs in that uh vicinity if you like snorkeling and uh scuba diving yeah yeah that's neat and uh there are some very nice resort hotels so you can go in and uh enjoy a very classy dinner uh the Peter Island Yacht Club is uh extremely exclusive like uh i think they're probably charging five hundred dollars a day for a room now ooh that's getting up there and uh it's there kind of a nice place to visit uh uh it's better being on a boat than being on land because uh your boat becomes your hotel your uh your dining room your taxi cab and uh everything else everything yeah that's why i think it would be neat um well i'd recommend it sounds good okay so do you have do you have the long i guess not not if there's see i was raised in New York but i guess up there you all don't have too long of a growing season do you uh well we probably have about three months do you do you do you do your own gardening approximately um-hum um-hum we live on a used to be a farm but we don't farm much we uh but we do have a garden huh see i got mine in well let's see i put in pepper plants this weekend oh i wish i could be doing that and uh yeah i got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen and uh-huh i enjoy tinkering with it you know it's pretty hot down here during the summer we hit you know a hundred hundred and two sometimes so but you know we don't do too much during the summer as far as tomatoes and stuff like that but uh-huh you right yeah you almost have to get started pretty early probably i guess yeah i can usually i can put in oh probably mid March i can put anything in the ground you know beets and onions and stuff like that uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh but then i have to wait for my tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks uh-huh as soon as we're sure we're not going to have another freeze then i'll finish it yeah you've had more freezing this winter or this yeah winter i think yeah we've had just a few you know freezes a little here and there but every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of April and it's pretty tough more bad weather um-hum um-hum um-hum are you do you work or are you retired or you no i work um i'm only forty years old i have to work uh uh my husbands retired but he's not a gardener he he he's been helping me more but he really isn't real uh real crazy about gardening well but i i really enjoy it it gives me time outdoors and you know i'm a golfer but it gives me time outdoors and time around my house and and i burned my grass off here in the last couple of days and uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh uh-huh getting ready to start to for the Spring season and see if i can grow me another nice lawn i usually have a pretty nice lawn it's a lot of work you know but it's um-hum huh oh yeah but it's a pleasure to like you said it's good to get outside and yeah it is and i like i like my garden too we didn't have to we have just a small garden but we planted corn last year too which takes quite a bit of space and uh-huh we we didn't have too good luck with it because the uh we had a couple of good real good wind storms and it really damaged the corn so we didn't get too much oh yeah corn last year we're going through that we going through the dust storms down here now so uh-huh but i uh what i did with my garden is i have a a two by six frame that's five by ten i have two of them sitting side by side uh-huh and then i put uh like a black plastic it's really not a black plastic it they call it Weedex and i put that down and then i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that oh uh-huh hum and i use a one of those black soaker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i lace it up and down there a couple of times and i only have to water about two hours a week um-hum um-hum oh that's great and it's pretty nice especially during the Summer it keeps everything wet instead of wilting uh-huh uh-huh yeah we don't we don't usually cover ours we did a few different times sometimes we've covered with the plastic and other years we've tried newspapers and uh but we generally don't we do our watering from our spring oh uh yeah we have an old fashioned tub sitting that you know water runs into and and uh my husband set up a pump that runs it runs till it's down and then it stops oh you have a spring how nice uh-huh and then when the water comes up it comes on again and we use that to water our garden oh that's uh that's pretty nice with so but you actually enjoy it huh oh i do i love it get out there on your hands and knees and crawl around i'd rather be doing that than housework i understand i can imagine you all have much trouble up there with insects or uh not a whole well not a whole lot i think our cabbages and broccolis and that we have more trouble with that type of thing with the the yeah with the worms yeah i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs and haven't figured out how to get rid of those yet uh uh-huh uh do you go more for natural keeping them off naturally or do you use insecticides yeah i try to no i uh uh try not to use any insecticides at all i try not to even use insecticides on my lawn but i sometimes i can't manage uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah well our lawn is is a big lawn because because we live out in the country and so we were not our lawn is not perfect you know it's just the it's just a lawn if uh-huh do you eat any of them yeah yeah well mine's full of dandelions now so no i never have i don't know how to prepare them oh did well did does your wife ever make uh a bake in a hot bacon dressing like for salad no huh-uh oh it's delicious and it goes real good on dandelions um-hum really huh i've never eaten dandelions now i've tried dandelion wine um-hum uh but i've never tried any dandelions just to eat uh-huh this is use the greens and you get them when they're young and tender you know before they have grown too too taut because they do get a little stringy yeah all right but u h they're kind of fun to to try get a get a few and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes yeah i'll try that i sure will yeah yeah oh i don't know uh but i've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back and he's been having trouble with so wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower so it takes about four hours to cut our grass oh oh you and we have we have hills i'm afraid of the hills but i'm getting on to it i just pretend they're not there and i just go ahead and do it so you all are into so you all are into the lawn big time huh yeah yeah i only got well i guess i got um my whole section of my house is probably maybe a tenth of an acre uh-huh and i have a pretty nice backyard and you know i've got enough room to throw horseshoes you know couple of other odds and ends uh-huh oh that's great great that's a lot of people don't have that much space even no and it's nice i'm just inside the city limits i'm probably a mile mile and a half inside the city limits and i'm only a mile and a half from work that uh-huh so you have all the conveniences of a city yeah and and the country also yeah it's pretty nice i have the room outside i need and i don't really have all the room in the house i need but uh-huh well you never have enough room do you think no no especially if your into any hobbies or anything or yeah i have a question to ask you about gardening though you know those what are they called the they called uh roly-poly bugs that's what my son calls them anyway uh-huh roly-poly what roly-poly bugs the ones that roll up in a ball i don't know what they're called is it a bug you mean they look like they've got yeah no no it's not like a no a worm a cut worm not a grub worm you find them under bricks and all that stuff where it's moist and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball oh i don't know what they call them but i'm plagued with those things down here and i haven't figured out i even called the nursery either though see um um-hum i'm trying to think of what they are what kind they could be i i don't know you find them under bricks usually and that yeah under bricks or under wood or you know if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long they get in there they usually come out at night but you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that's been laying around no they're not a slug not a a slug is actually kind of slimy and and these are just he plays with them all time he picks them up and rolls them across the patio yeah yeah yeah oh really they are not hard are they are they a hard worm no no they're not real hard they're not a hard huh they're like a a water bug of sorts i don't know what they're called them yeah yeah yeah when when you touch them they roll up oh are they black then but they roll up i can't think of what kind they would be uh-huh i'm no help on that then because i can't think of what they are but i'm plagued with those what they would be but i think you have a lot more insects down there even than than what we have you know i think it's because probably because we're in more of a tempered zone you know we don't really we only freeze down here in January and February at the most you know uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i know my brother had trouble with fire ants and that even uh yeah and they be can be a real dickens yeah i got fire ants too and you spray in one part of your lawn and they just move to another part so you got to spray your whole yard and then uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah your your neighbor gets them and then he sprays his yard and you get them back again so yeah but we're not doing too bad down here really you know the daffodils are out and and uh yeah you keep trading them yeah uh-huh uh-huh ours are going to be coming out now our cancer society sales daffodils right now they're they're big now so we we have daffodils for in the house because of the cut flowers but they're just beginning to come out the end bud yeah yeah yeah see mine are up and bloomed already oh and they sure are pretty i like them and the Snap Dragons are starting to come up oh oh they're such a nice bright early spring color yeah and then in in my back flower bed i have uh tiger lilies um-hum um-hum and they bloom in you know late June mid July and they're yeah they are they're real nice but they're they're nice and green you know they're up above a foot maybe eighteen inches um-hum and they're beautiful too yeah they're beautiful uh-huh oh my they come up real pretty every year no problem yeah no we won't have too much here for another couple of months yet really yeah yeah we're having it's raining today is it still pretty cool up there yeah well do you all have a what kind of grass do you grow up there do you grow uh Bermuda or rye or well our grass like i said is just grass we really didn't plant anything it's just so i suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even okay yeah see we i have Bermuda in my yard now i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there but and uh uh-huh um-hum it's probably very pretty Bermuda seems to be yeah Bermuda seems to do pretty good down here uh-huh uh-huh we have some people that have done their lawns and and uh in Carolina and i've had Baltimore Maryland so wow that's great you're just getting all over the country aren't you i'm a non Texas Instruments employee and i always i always feel like when i get someone in Texas that you're probably employed by oh really yes i am i am yeah well i was surprised that they had their people their own people in the survey but then why not well i didn't realize that i thought all of it was TI employees in the survey i i didn't i was the other way around i thought i didn't realize there were outside people in the survey so oh i see uh do you know what they're doing with all this when they're finished um i am not positive um i i probably have gotten about the same information you have because i don't work anywhere even near that division i'm in even even in a completely different site so um-hum i know that that once they get through with this i i've read where they're they may call certain certain people back for like the second phase or something i'm but i'm not really sure i mean i know do you know why they're you gathering the information right no i don't oh you don't what they're what they're working on is uh the way i understand it is the computer system that you know in the future and who knows how far in the future they they believe that computers will be able to understand human voice where instead of having to have a keyboard and press in what you want the computer to do oh i see you'll be able to tell it what you want it to do and that's why they're gathering the voices in order to do research to enable computers to be able to do that uh in other words they want to know if our voice can direct a machine right that's exactly right well gosh i couldn't direct children i doubt that i can direct a machine are you in Dallas then direct a machine huh um i'm in Lewisville which is just north of Dallas just about thirty minutes north of Dallas yeah so north of Dallas yeah we uh just came home from an expensive trip west and drove through the Dallas Fort Worth area without uh stopping for any reason whatsoever and i did you we're our town is five thousand so i was very concerned about what the trip the traffic would be like around Dallas Fort Worth and gosh we were through there before we even realized that we were in heavy traffic so you've got a good system sure yeah yeah we really do we really do unless you're doing it first thing in the morning or last thing in the evening you know but it's that way anywhere right there is that time of day isn't there uh there is there is it's that way anywhere you go shall we get on to nursing homes yeah that's fine go ahead okay uh my mother is seventy will be seventy nine years old this fall and has been a nursing home resident for nearly three years oh my goodness oh really so uh i feel like i have uh my decision was not i did not make the decision to send her to a nursing home she made the decision that she could not any longer live in in her apartment by herself she had long since given up her home and gone into an apartment and of course that was her decision at the time too so uh-huh uh-huh and then in that we are in a small royal a rural community i think that makes such a difference too because well as a matter of fact my daughter is now the assistant director of nurses at that nursing home oh wow how wonderful she yes yes she wasn't at the time uh-huh but she has since gone to that nursing home so i just feel that i did not have any of the trauma that people talk about you sound like you've gotten very lucky you really have well it just did a really marvelous thing and mother's mind is good it's her body that's bad and uh yeah good uh-huh for to have the responsibility of putting someone in a nursing home whose mind was not good and could not tell you if they were being mistreated or something it just would all be so different uh-huh yeah oh definitely we kind of went through a situation with my father my father was a um diabetic he was pronounced a diabetic when he was thirty and uh had diabetes for all you know many many years and hum you know didn't take quite as good care of himself in the beginning as he should have i mean he was put on insulin immediately but his diet he wasn't as careful with as he should have been in the beginning so he deteriorated rather quickly and hum by the time he was in his mid fifties which is very young he was he was nearly blind and was going into kidney failure and couldn't um-hum couldn't walk for very long periods of time the muscles in his neck and that type of thing had deteriorated to the point that he always had to have something to lean his head back against and and you know we were you know myself and my two sisters were um you know in the situation of a a fifty seven year old father looking in to put him in a nursing home which was which was at fifty i'm know it's scary isn't it yeah i mean it was i'm fifty seven right it was just a horrible situation for us to both you know to be in and we just you know because of course like you say like your mother his mind was was perfect and wonderful it was he just could not get around to take care of himself um and uh we ended up opting for um a live-in nurse and you know that came into his home and and we set her up a room in a spare room and she stayed there with him instead because we just could not imagine a fifty seven year old man in a nursing home we just you know we just could not could not imagine doing it um and we knew that it wouldn't you know we couldn't even do the the live-in nurse thing forever you know and but he was just so against and and when you said your mother knew that this is probably where she needed to be it was such a different story because he was um-hum so against going to a nursing home which at that age i can't blame him you know it would just it just scared him to death to be you know that young and who knows you know the thought of being there another twenty or thirty years you know just was was just um-hum um-hum yeah yeah too much for him you know so we you know we opted for that route so i kind of know what you mean about the the trauma of you know the thought of doing it you know it was just um-hum it was just very hard but i guess you know there's there's there's good ones and there's bad ones i think you just have to be so very careful you know and um-hum you know you're lucky if you do have a situation where the mind is is still good and they can tell you if they're being well taken care of i think otherwise you you end up with serious problems um in our locality we have a lot of uh government services like the Home Health Care and etcetera etcetera which i'm sure they do in cities too you know uh-huh um-hum but we do not have the staff to draw from from to find someone who could stay for day in and day out with they we just don't have those people uh-huh they just are not available even though you would like to make that choice uh-huh well you know that was another situation because my this was my father lived in Missouri and was in a little small town of about three thousand and uh we just got very very lucky and found a woman who was willing to do this and you know someone that we had known from you know had lived in town you know that same town forever and we knew very well and we knew her history and we knew that she wasn't going to steal from him we knew that she would take good care of him and um-hum um yeah and we just got extremely lucky to find someone who was willing to do it and she stayed five days a week and spent the night but did go home on weekends and then we found another girl who had been kind of coming in and helping Dad clean and do that kind of thing for several years who said that she was willing to stay on the weekends and help him um-hum hum so we just got extremely we were like you only the other end we got extremely lucky all the way around that we were able to find somebody that would stay with him at home hum hum how long how long were you able to maintain that well uh we only made we only did that for um i guess that went on for about all not quite six months he passed away after six months there at home which oh uh-huh we were very thankful that we were able to keep him at home and that you know he did pass away at home and uh rather than being in a nursing home i know he was much happier spending that six months at home yeah yeah oh um-hum um-hum your mother was not living or you know definitely so uh they were they had been divorced many years earlier yeah so he was he was alone and really had you know and yeah yeah yeah and uh my uh youngest sister was um about an hour and a half away in college and uh i was you know down here six hundred miles away and then my the third sister was in Atlanta Georgia you know so we weren't really yeah well we were even right there where we could take care of him you know so it was really a hard situation you know when in this society where everybody kind of gets spread out it's not as easy as it used to be to take care of aging parents you know it you know you um um-hum um-hum it's hard to move them in with you or you move in with them or even you know drop in everyday you know you just i just never considered the moving in with i could not ever have handled that my mother is incontinent and uh and i don't know i suppose that would have been my excuse uh yeah uh-huh but i don't think had that situation existed not existed that i could have done that at all i'm not that's a that's a real trying experience to try to you know to move back in and and live harmoniously together after all those years it's i um-hum um-hum um-hum well i think my sister is an RN and lives in Knoxville Tennessee and i think that my mother had thought in the back of her mind that she perhaps might go to Jean's and it did take when she first went into the care care center uh-huh she just completely gave up uh just could not even sit up in the wheelchair without being tied in uh-huh and that went on for almost six months and uh finally my sister came to visit and mother was talking about getting better and getting out of the care center oh and my sister is very blunt and she said mother this is going to be your home you might as well get used to it which i could not say to her and from that point on i think within the next six months she came to accept that as fact and then she began improving and is walking better now than she probably did in three years but uh-huh wonderful oh that's wonderful still for the most part she is wheelchair bound or bed bound and um um-hum i don't know i guess maybe i have accepted that the nursing home is her home because i've started to decorate her room more than i ever did in the beginning so uh-huh uh even though everyone knows that's the way it has to be you still it takes a little bit to accept no no and certainly it's very expensive there's no question about that doesn't make it easy no oh but we had a severe ice no doubt no doubt hi Chris this is Carol hi this is interesting uh question come up here uh proposal for people to young people to spend a year or two in the Peace Corps um or something like that doing public service i or doing or doing public service suppose the idea is to um i don't know but but the point be to that get well in order to go in order to join the Peace Corps you have to have a college degree and so that eliminates a lot of people from that and doing public service how are they supposed to support themselves it sure does yeah i i i suppose the idea the idea would be to get um people interested in public service and to um i don't know maybe people give give people give young people an appreciation for maybe what they have and what other people don't have well yeah i think that's a good idea although i don't i think if it's something that's forced on you um um i think that the attitude is not going to be quite the same well i tend to agree and um uh in that we do live in the United States and i think one of our uh one of the things that our country is based on is freedom of choice yeah um forcing someone to give up a couple years of their life uh doing something that may not be or the timing that they want to do it or uh perhaps even you know maybe they would have something something else just just the idea of forcing someone to do something i i'm pretty much against that yeah from what i've read most people in the United States do do some type of volunteer work at some time in their lives just on their own um-hum but i right but i agree it has to be at their choice and it needs to be a time when they're ready to do it um i don't think you can just snatch somebody away from you know you don't know what their circumstances are or what's going on in their life you can't just snatch them away and make them go do something they don't want to do that's right sort of like the draft i think there would be an awful lot of resentment and um i i really don't think it would be feasible on our country then that raises a question of how you know are you going to pay them or are you going to provide them with you know place to live and food to eat and whether they have a family you know that's right yeah some young people do some young people start families young and or maybe are responsible for their parents yeah that's true that's true brothers and sisters things like that i suppose they may have exceptions but um i guess it all it would all boil down to i mainly i i guess my question would be what what's the purpose what's what's trying to be accomplished by by that proposal i'm not sure i'm not sure if it's a way to cut down government expenses or it's like you said that's something more you know to to make people aware um-hum more esoteric yeah what's going on and what needs to be done but i really do think that the population that people are pretty well aware i think more so now than ever before you know i think that's true and i i tend to think that our children are also growing up with a bit more awareness of that at least i mean i i feel i try to as an individual my children are very young but yeah um i i think they're being taught a lot maybe to be more responsible um-hum and um hopefully to understand that everyone is not as in as fortunate yeah as as perhaps they are yeah yeah and i think that that's the trend now i think that's the trend now and i think people are a lot more willing to give of their time pardon me and help out you know its also seems to me if someone does it on a volunteer basis then they will probably put a lot more into it than if they were forced um yeah and get and get more out of it that's right so i think we or sounds like we pretty much agree yeah it's an interesting idea but i think we do agree and at least i'm i'm i don't think i would vote for it if it came down to that no i don't think i would either maybe just do our best to to do our own fair share and do what you can when you can right then as long as you feel good about yourself and what you're doing to help i think that's more important than that's right well it's been nice talking to you about it i have to admit it's something i hadn't thought of before it it is interesting to think about it nice talking yeah really well it does kind of catch you by surprise yes okay well thanks okay we'll talk to you later bye-bye bye-bye okay okay Bob um our project's painting um do you have any uh any thoughts on whether painting's a good idea or a bad idea well well of course uh it depends i guess on what you're uh oh oh what you're you're interest and abilities are so far as whether you're going to paint yourself uh i've painted uh like i said both interior and exterior myself uh not a lot of exterior but uh i've painted you know rooms and ceilings inside and you know and i usually find it uh pretty easy and and it's cheaper than hiring somebody else to do it oh that's yeah that's for sure um what kind of paint do you like to use it's um yeah yeah it well i i nearly always use a latex base uh especially for interior uh the brands uh you know vary but uh Sherwin Williams makes a pretty good paint and Jones Blair and you know Kelley i think makes pretty good paint so yeah then you don't have you don't have that mess to clean up when you use an oil oil base painting and boy i'll tell you oh yeah right right you know um um we uh i designed and built my own home about twelve years ago um and it was one of the uh you know the old New England saltbox so instead of painting because i figured when i got uh just a couple years older i'm not going to want to climb up on a ladder yeah so we put uh white cedar shingles on the house and let it weather naturally um-hum and the trim instead of painting i stained yeah so i figured instead of going out there and scraping and you know having a having to climb up on a ladder the stain kind of just uh it weathers um-hum so i eliminated that chore that i don't have to do that i stained the original stain and i stained once since then because it started fading a little bit um-hum but other than that um i'm like you i like to use a latex paint on the inside we've uh we've done some uh walls right yeah the ones we haven't papered we've done in uh uh latex uh uh pastels yeah yeah and clean up is is uh is a joy uh a little soap and water and air dry them and you don't have to worry about that right yeah the what kind of what kind of equipment do you use uh i mean just brush and roller or yeah a roller and uh i bought one of those that you can screw in uh uh a three foot extension um-hum so you can climb up on the walls and the ceilings we didn't paint the ceilings was just natural plaster uh-huh so i didn't want to get into doing anything there it's just uh so far it's okay you know we haven't had any problems with it yeah that's uh i i did a had to paint the uh my brick my house is brick on the outside except for the overhangs and you know like a a little bit of uh what do you call the the eaves and stuff and uh yeah so you're lucky too you don't have to worry about going out there and scraping and painting and yeah yeah but uh those overhangs and things do have to be painted you know every four or five years and i bought a uh a power roller that uh it's really designed for indoor use but it's got an uh you know an extension and a pump you just put your can of paint down in the in this pump and it pumps the paint up through the roller how do you control the amount of flow or anything and and it works pretty good well it's got a uh got a regulator on it that you just set the set the deal on it you know for the the flow and then it's got a trigger on it that you can release to let the pressure pump the paint up into this handle well is there a little electric pump you put in there yeah it's an electric just a little electric pump motor that uh turns on and off you know builds up pressure so that it you know it kind of pushes the paint up this uh up the extension hum that's interesting it's a uh Black and Decker brand and and it works pretty good like i said it was designed for indoor use you know for painting walls and ceilings but i found it worked pretty good for outdoors uh yeah there's certain times of the year of course that uh that it probably wouldn't do very well because of the temperature and stuff but but uh the right time of year it works pretty good you really have a problem down there with with having to repaint with with paint blistering or peeling off or well if if you buy a good grade of paint uh you don't really uh of course Texas heat you know you it really gets pretty hot outside so you have to be sure and get a good grade of paint oh that's there for direct yeah the direct sun beating on it yeah yeah that's right for the direct sunlight and stuff right but uh but i i haven't really found it too bad we've lived in our house about uh oh thirteen years i suppose and and really really only painted once and you know it was new when we bought it and we painted one time since then but you know it's probably going to be time to paint again in a couple of years so you're in the same position that i'm in i've i've only done mine twice and you've you've done yours twice too well once was on there and then you just had to do it once right right so and uh yeah on the on the interior do you do uh do y'all have a lot of uh plaster walls that the the uh color is built into the plaster so you don't paint a lot no no oh yeah i i watch uh some of these TV programs you know how to do it's you know you fix it oh like This Old House you fix it so yeah This Old House and some of those and i i really haven't you know haven't paid a lot of attention to to whether or not you do painting on on top of plaster or not so hum so i hadn't hadn't really thought about that so they just when they when they put the plaster walls up they just tinted the plaster well that's what my impression was that they you know that they were just white well they're white walls you know unless it's white if you want white walls then white plaster is uh doesn't need to be painted or that was my impression anyway i'm not sure hum yeah that's interesting no ours you know wouldn't they were just regular plaster walls but uh yeah uh-huh and then some of them you know like the kitchen and the bathrooms we uh we had put paper up right yeah and actually the uh bedrooms upstairs too but but the rest of it and i i just don't like papering i painting is is a lot easier yeah that's yeah yeah well we really have uh our our bedrooms i guess are the ones that have uh that have to be painted uh we've got paper on uh our dining room and kitchen and bathrooms and then we've got paneling in our family room and game room all right so you don't have a a lot of paint either so but we don't have a lot of paint inside of course the ceilings are you know all all have to be painted uh-huh yeah but uh but they don't require a lot if the only the problem that i've seen in the past is like when you've got uh if you've got natural gas and heat of course you don't in the east i suppose you don't have a lot of natural gas heat but if you don't have your y our heat adjusted your gas adjusted right then you can get some stains you know on the ceilings and you know ceiling ceiling oh they get yeah yeah and that's something we don't we get uh we've got on oil fired hot water baseboard um-hum yeah so and it doesn't generate uh there's a little dust on it once in a while but it's not even like hot air yeah right so and we don't use gas in fact there wasn't any gas in the in the street when we built there was no houses around yeah um so we didn't have that problem um yeah so i've got a wood stove um-hum and i thought for a while that that may create a problem but it hasn't it's wood it's uh yeah if it's been a dry air tight yeah so that even that doesn't doesn't create a problem but i think uh yeah yeah more and more people are getting away from paint they're they're doing other things um especially with the oil base yeah yeah yeah but the paneling and the wallpapering and the and that kind of stuff are alike yep yep the and there's there's less maintenance um-hum yeah it's and it's been nice to not have to worry about painting the these rooms that we've got to have the paneling on them yeah you don't have to of course if you decide you want to change the paper and you know you've got just about as much problem as yeah that's right so well we did do that we we stripped the paint off or the paper off of one of our you know off of our part of our house and then repapered it and it's that was not any fun but uh we stripped and then had somebody else come in and do the actually put the paper up next time i think i'll do it the other way around let them strip and i'll hang the paper oh i hate hanging paper that is oh that's one of the jobs that i just i'd do anything else but i'll i'll um uh-huh yeah yeah but papering and uh and and putting up uh drywall for the plaster i hate that stuff too you know i just contracted that stuff out and yeah yeah that's yeah i did the papering you know when we built but that's not my uh that's not my cup of tea yeah it's there hanging the hanging the drywall is not uh not a lot of fun you got to you got to really pay attention and and know pretty much what your doing with that to get it up and get the the uh seams and everything yeah covered up just right and all that so it's so what are the other questions that i'm actually i had a house um my home before this one was uh was a Cape Ann and i wasn't up and down too that was uh that was kind of high and that was painted um oh yeah they are we bought that and it was uh the paint was uh so-so i had scraped i had to do a lot of scraping and then i put uh uh water base paint over the uh oil um-hum and it was eight years before i had to do it again oh that's and uh and the manufacturer recommended that uh he gave me uh i can't remember what the solution was and he said just uh wash your house down with it um-hum and then uh you know with a long brush and then just hose it all down and i had the whole yard was full of soap suds yeah and he said just paint over that and we sold the house oh well twelve years ago yeah yeah and i don't think they've repainted since well now that's so that's held up and that's an oil base on the bottom and then a water base and it was right i had uh i had put one coat of of uh over that water base and then before we sold it there was another one and i'd wash the house down and all that um-hum yeah and it's it's held up okay camping my camping experiences are uh using a trailer a Terry eighteen foot uh mobile trailer and and that's you know like going to lakes and stuff like that i see sure setting up the trailer for a weekend or a week or ten days or whatever uh what's what's your thoughts on camping uh-huh well for me camping i've never owned a trailer so for me camping is more more more has a lot more to do with backpacks and tents uh-huh but i guess that this camping two kinds of camping that um i've done one is to throw a a tent and food food and the like in the back of a car and drive to a campsise and setup the tent and have the the car right next to me um-hum the other is to actually you know carry everything on your back i've done camping out in at in the Aspen Mountains in Colorado where yeah that's up here in New England that's we call that backpacking which is the same thing which is you're you've got everything on your back you know an aluminum camp frame uh right right exactly uh uh yeah that well um the older you get the more convenience you try to bring with you i guess so i'm up to dragging the trailer around which is my next step is going to be probably Winnebago i hope if i only can afford one but that i understand oh yeah oh of course camping again is is is like you say that that your your backpacking is i guess what i would call true camping i'm not right i'm not sure that the other camping type of camping is nothing more than a leisure or well either way it's get i guess maybe we can define it as living away from the home that's right that's right we have we have uh around the lakes and ponds up here and stuff we have uh campsites that are uh barriers set aside for each like the each individual trailer and you have a sewer hookup and water and electricity but exactly and you back in you know and or just pull into your spot and uh some you can rent by the year some you can rent daily or nightly or by the week or whatever um-hum yeah when when i mentioned i've done this camping out of the car i've actually done of the situation just like that but what's interesting is it's through Texas Instruments oh really yeah TI has a little uh owns a piece of land on the edge of a lake that borders that the lake is on the border of Texas and Oklahoma it's called Lake Texoma yeah they what Lake Texoma they've got a big uh big rec centers up there right yeah that's right so that's where i've done most of that actually is that a pretty nice place it is it's really beautiful the the lake is is outstanding it's a huge huge huge lake yeah i spent about ten years in Abilene for TI i i worked out there in Abilene in west Texas and i never did get a chance to get over to Lake Texoma i i wished i had uh oh yeah oh yeah i think you well if you every get to Dallas you can probably you know borrow you can go up there and get a space for the night for two bucks that's unreal yeah yeah so it's easy to do i'm actually interested in getting one of those kind of my wife has been talking about this in the past couple of years one of those kind of campers that pop-up so it's about uh maybe eight foot square and but only about two feet tall and when you get to where you're going it raises up and there's tenting material oh yeah that folds out from it it's like a crank up top thing you yeah it's you're talking of a trailer type that you pull huh yeah okay yes exactly exactly exactly my wife has a lot of interest in those and i've actually been keeping my eye on the paper and they seem to be running between one and two thousand dollars which yeah yeah you can that's about the price of them up here they're they're uh uh Sears sells them Coleman sells them sure they have some some good buys on them and those are pretty nice i they're they're have a little galley a little uh sink that's got some compressed air and water in it and uh and a little stove that's like a propane stove yeah uh um-hum couple of little cabinets and and uh sleeping on either end of the the canvas when you open it up it's just all screened in so it's pretty neat uh oh yeah yeah that the nice thing about dragging that is that it's very very convenient to travel on the highway with because it's very low i see mine is like pulling a big house behind you you know oh yeah you said yours is eighteen feet long what yeah an eighteen foot Terry uh it's completely self-contained i mean i have everything a shower a TV everything in it you know but oh yeah you you the brand is Terry yeah T E R R Y Terry oh i never heard of it well they're i guess they're pretty popular up this way yeah it's a pretty rugged trailer it's a tandem wheel even though it's only eighteen foot long so there's it drags pretty good you know with a car but yeah i've got a big Oldsmobile that i pull it with when i yeah uh if i get rid of that i'll have to get rid of the trailer because i don't i'm not sure what else will be able to lug it around the hills up here well that's neat oh yeah that's something kind of hilly country up through this way but yeah um yeah well that's great well uh i i like camping i i did a lot of it i when my kids were small of course they're all grown now and gone i've got four boys and they've kind of all gone and we don't really do that together much anymore as they've out two are out in California and two are still in Texas so we kind of don't get together but maybe once a year and then we just do a little fishing but right i wished i had the opportunity to do camping because i used to love to live at the lake all summer and into the fall and oh yeah yeah uh it was kind of pretty nice but uh i just wish that i had an opportunity to do a little more that's right the thing that i i then again i i tried pulling the trailer one year and i went everywhere with the trailer like to beaches and to stuff but that got to be a hassle you know breaking down and setting up and breaking down so i decided that and and right i would lease a spot a spot on this particular lake here in northern New England and go there every every spring and stay there all summer and it really worked out good for me um-hum and and you can and you still do that oh yeah yeah and so you drive to work from there or you just take the summer off yeah no i d rive from the campground oh wow that's nice which uh it adds maybe twenty miles uh you know uh each way but it's not all that much uh yeah twenty miles is going is just going a little different way it's probably twenty miles longer than my normal way to work i live in Rhode Island work in Massachusetts but i see it's uh it just adds about twenty miles to it but it's worth it to get to the campground and be just be out in the country and the woods all by yourself or you know with just a few neighbors around or so right and that's that's pretty nice because you can fish and just well i envy that what a great life yeah well like i say it just uh i i enjoy doing it i wished i had more time to do it but hopefully i can get up a retirement here before too much longer and then yeah huh i'll be looking forward to to like i say with a Winnebago because as the older you get the less things you want to do i understand and i don't want to let the i don't want to let the canopy down i don't want to jack it up i don't want to do all that stuff anymore and just turn the key off and get in the back and do whatever you know that's right just want to get in and yeah yeah that's funny well but uh it's been nice uh like i really appreciate talking with you and i thought i'd uh give you a call on my lunch time here today and worked out good nice talking to you too well i appreciate it and and good luck with your uh your future your hopes of buy a Winnebago yeah uh i thank you very much you're ever up this way look me up here at TI in Attleboro i'll do it nice talking to you Ray bye-bye thanks sir what kind of coins do you primarily collect um basically i my preference is Arab coins hum and ancient coins hum i've got a uh i've got a few i don't know i don't know i don't even know if they're real but they seem to be very old Greek or Roman coins that somebody gave me as i when i was a kid never done anything with them i still got still got them in a box um-hum i'm mostly into uh American gold and silver dollars and stuff like that oh very interesting um over the years of course by uh my grandparents used to give me silver dollars so i've got a few of those tucked away but um-hum um your Greek and Roman coins might you know if if they're um in good condition might be worth something you might want to drag them out and i keep meaning to do that everytime i go to a show i keep saying well i'll take them with me and let somebody look at them they just they just feel phony you know they feel like they're made of lead or something and uh they don't have any sort of it's it's got a it's got a like a picture on it um-hum but there's no uh inscriptions or or dates or anything else that would be the Greek ones yeah okay because i think most the Roman ones have had something on them right right so this yeah it had a it had a had a has a bust of somebody on there but uh no sort of identifying marks or anything um-hum um it the are they silver or no i don't no they're not they're it's it's too heavy for silver it's it's more like lead i think fairly soft bronze oh interesting yeah i think they're fakes did did somebody go over to the Middle East where they could have picked up some fakes pretty easily probably i don't know where they got them from they just came up gave me a whole bag of these things oh um-hum it's probably about thirty or forty of them in there gee that's yeah they you might be sitting on a gold mine wouldn't that be something right um i don't know a lot about um Greek and Roman although i'm a member of an organization and that is the the primary interest of some ancient uh Numismatic Society Club um-hum and so most of the people collect Roman with a few collecting Greek so every now and then we have a program so i've picked up a bit hum but um if it if they're really soft and very early they could be uh i think they call them Lydian coins huh and um gosh all these years i've been thinking they were fakes maybe they're real right i don't uh you know i i guess they say that a lot of people in the in the Middle East particularly can pick up fakes um-hum you know if you go to um uh a fight and then the people say oh look what i just dug out of the ground and they sell you something they made last night um-hum but um i think that's fairly recent phenomena probably sounds like some of the coin dealers i know now now they're supposed to they're supposed to be licensed and the um above board right i used to be a coin dealer so i i i know i know those guys you know oh i see oh and you made your own yeah i got a whole roll of Krugerrands here would you like to buy i just made them last night here's a nice uh twenty dollar gold eagle uh just just manufactured in Lebanon last year was uh was the gold worth i mean was it really gold yeah that they they are gold they're just of course the the twenty dollar gold pieces go for coin value not the bullion value right and amazingly enough you're you're into Middle Eastern sort of coins the the largest amount of fakes of US gold is made in Lebanon oh really yeah is that uh still still true yeah still is wow yeah that's sort of like a cottage industry industry over there um-hum uh and and there's some very specific things you can find you can even narrow narrow it down to where it was made i mean people are so aware of these things that there are certain identifying marks on there that would not be on a real one and uh you you can almost tell the area somebody probably even knows the guy who made them you mean make oh i suppose he he has to protect himself too so that somebody can't say you know when he's selling them that somebody else made it i mean it's so that he gets his own profits yeah well the yeah coin dealers are supposed to be smart enough not to fall for that gimmick but i i have seen a few of them sell these things and course you have to you have to be able to prove they they knew it was counterfeit and that's always very difficult hum oh i see otherwise the the buyer is responsible i mean responsible well he can he can usually go back to the dealer but if if it's an unscrupulous dealer he'll just say hey you know you you had an opportunity to see it you know it's yours course you can always turn around and sell it in court and but you'd have to go in on a fraud count and that wouldn't uh-huh fraud is very difficult to prove um-hum um-hum because you have to you have to show they knowingly did it right and that's all he's got to say is well in my in my professional judgment it was a it was a real coin um-hum so you know it's his word against mine right right that's one of the reasons i got out of the business there was too many shenanigans going on oh that's interesting because i'm more interested in the research and i'm doing some dye link analyses of of these early coins from the six and seven hundreds and so and so i'm not into the the buying and selling business um-hum um it sounds like i'm wise yes yeah nowadays the the the way the uh the market is and the and the way the uh grading systems have changed over the last few years that's primarily what got me out of it they they kept changing the grading systems on coins and you know you go out and buy a very nice silver dollar collection and you've graded it at the current grade and then the next year they've changed the grading system and now these things are worth a fourth of what you paid for them you know it's just it it just got it just got ludicrous after a while oh um-hum um-hum uh what what what the the standards for for an uncirculated silver dollar changed so many times in three years and a lot of people lost lots of money on that course the the persistent dealers will just sit there if they graded them as M S sixty five then by golly they're M S sixty five i don't care what you say um-hum um-hum and they'll keep them until some fool comes along and buys them right at inflated prices um-hum i think that's that's the the hardest thing is that people who don't really know feel sometimes a sometimes for example i know um you know the ancients better but because it's old they figure it's got to cost you know thousands of dollars oh yeah yeah i mean it's really it's it silly i mean i i i used to have people walk into my shop with um Indian head pennies you know um-hum and they say wow you know this is really old yeah well it's not worth anything i'll give you a nickel for it you know oh and even even some of the rare coins that a lot of people have never even seen like um like two cent pieces right right and things like that those are not those are not even expensive i mean you can pick up very nice ones for eight nine dollars oh really i didn't know that oh yeah yeah they're cheap they're super cheap um oh that several i mean it's it's it it's funny the way the business works because there're so many things that are enormously out priced um-hum um some some later proof sets because they have a slight error in them are are worth hundreds of dollars you know and and the coins themselves aren't worth very much at all face value basically um-hum uh and then of course the silver coins are more and more being traded for bullion than anything else um-hum uh you can you can buy bags of silver coins a a bag has a thousand dollars face value in it and it's traded for silver oh yeah so basically if if someone isn't really interested in the coins it's not some an investment no it's it's more of a uh it's a commodity purchase really um-hum uh it is fun though to buy these bags and go through them because you do find some some uh nice coins i mean people who are starting out collections and need to fill holes in their books can fill a whole bunch of them with these uh with these bags um-hum uh especially you you want to get a mixed bag of course dimes quarters and halves um-hum uh but you could fill a whole bunch of uh holes with these things i used to i used to advertise buying wheat pennies um i'd give a dollar a roll which two cents a piece which is basically overpriced um-hum um but i used to go through i i'd get loads and loads of these things i ended up one time with about uh about about twelve bags of these things and i'd gone through all of them and i found a couple of them i found a nineteen O nine VDB oh and uh a um a nineteen eleven which is fairly scarce i found several good ones out of there um-hum people's giving it to me for two cents i uh that's okay right turn around and sell it for fifteen dollars um hello um what is your favorite um food for a dinner party um i don't know i i think i make things you know that i do things kind of simple because i i you know i just have close friends over i make like lasagna and uh oh we like to have barbecues outside so you know when the weather's nice because in Texas you have a lot of nice weather so we do a lot of um things like that um i'm not really into gourmet cooking so i don't know how to do that so i don't have gourmet foods do you do Tex-Mex um yeah you know like fajitas and and stuff like that so oh fajitas how do you make fajitas um it's kind of like made out of skirt steak and you marinate it um-hum you can buy marinating mixes here i don't know if get it up there or you can you know marinate it in any kind of barbecue sauce you like and then you um oh you quick fry it real fast with in hot hot grease you know not a whole not not deep frying it but you can either barbecue it which is really good oh with uh green beans not green beans but green peppers and red peppers and onions um-hum and um then you put it on a flour like you know you make your meat real um thin you know bite size pieces um-hum then you put it on flour tortillas with you know guacamole and um sour cream and you know all kinds of you know kind it's like a Tex-Mex type thing oh it sounds good it's really good you can do it with chicken too chicken fajitas and stuff okay so well that's nice so what kind of cooking do you do up there oh well basically um because i lived in the Middle East for a while i tend to fix Middle Eastern foods when i have have people over oh that sounds interesting and so um some of the dips are like um chick peas mashed with um sesame uh-huh and um called food um what's it called i forgot what it's called anyway and and lemon you cook them so often you kind of forget their names yeah yeah that's right that's right it's called humus now i remember it and um uh dipping Arabic bread the thin pita bread in that oh uh-huh or another dip is made with very similar but with um eggplant which has been actually barbecued it ends up with a barbecued taste although we usually bake it in the oven or if we have uh those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just by putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it black on the outside but mushy on the inside oh that's unusual i'd never heard of anything like that you know here in Texas it's all you know Tex-Mex cooking and barbecue and they're really big on stuff like that and yeah but barbecue is it like steaks or is it uh turkey yeah you barbecue steaks pardon me would you barbecue a turkey or a chicken or oh yeah you can barbecue turkey if you have a big enough grill but my i cook my turkeys inside you know it buy you can buy smoked turkeys uh-huh and or uh but most the stuff that we barbecue is like steak and chicken and hamburgers hot dogs um-hum you know the simple things like that and um-hum you know we we like things like that you know barbecue beans or baked beans and um-hum i'm sure that uh the chicken that we barbecue from the Middle East has a lemon garlic sauce i wouldn't imagine that a barbecued chicken would no no this is more like hickories hickory type you know depending on the barbecue uh-huh it's like a smokey flavor if you've ever you know had stuff like that yeah it's totally different sounds like it would be interesting to eat some of the Middle Eastern cooking so um-hum right right yeah well it's been fun talking to you yeah it's been fun it's been nice it's uh you know neat to learn some what different people eat so right you get to think you know i come from Wyoming and it's basically the same same type of thing except for you do eat more the Tex-Mex down here so uh in Wyoming it would be less spicy yeah yeah you you know down there it's just like meat and potatoes you know vegetables once in a while yeah right oh dear well it's been interesting to talk to you okay very good thank you for calling bye-bye okay bye-bye well what's your favorite shows oh gosh that's hard to say it's um used to be a big Twin Peaks fan but they've made me mad so i haven't watched them in a while in a while uh-huh um oh i watch a lot of uh public we watch public television a lot Mystery and hm oh oh i oh i really like Mysteries uh-huh that's one of my favorite yeah Mystery and uh Masterpiece Theater yeah i watch that occasionally when yeah there's something really interesting on um-hum but uh oh out out outside of that i it's hard to have a i don't really watch a whole lot yeah i don't not anymore i don't there's just nothing on it yeah i got i got sort of hooked on that uh Dark Shadows have you yeah i when i watched it originally i didn't know it was a i don't know it was going to be a series i thought it was just a movie um and so i started watching it and all of a sudden stay tuned next week and i went what and then it blows into this whole series thing so i sort of had to stay with it yeah is is it good is it not really it it it's it's gotten to the point it's getting ridiculous now and yeah they they just had the uh season finale and i don't i don't know what they accomplished but i think the writers just figure well let's just do anything and yeah we'll we'll have a couple of months to come up with some new ideas yeah that that's that's kind of what happened on Twin Peaks they did all this big building up building up building up and then the the solution was ridiculous i had it figured out by the third yeah yeah i thought i already had it figured out and i did and that made me mad yeah i don't like programs that i can figure it out yeah um the only one that i watch religiously is LA Law um-hum i really like that well my parents my parents really like LA Law yeah that's that's my favorite is it good i've i've always heard it was really good well i'm i'm a struggling law student oh and i the reason i like it is because they give you good law in there do they yeah it's not like these other programs where they just make up anything they want oh yeah and they they throw little tidbits out that are really good you know like they they at least you know they've been in a courtroom before um-hum of course i mean it's got its bad side so it's limited by the format and obviously you don't get into court as quickly as they seem to make it out that you do oh of course yeah oh no they're they're in California and they're they're waiting list is about four years four or five years for a civil case ooh Lord so uh yeah i mean you know it's very difficult to it'd be nice if justice traveled that quickly but but it sure it it sure doesn't yeah it would yeah no not at all you know the wheels of justice grind slowly yeah well it's not really justice's fault but that's on a another whole subject altogether yeah i'll agree with you there i'll agree with you oh i know i know the shortcomings too yeah yeah yeah oh let's see what oh i guess i've got a two year old so we do Sesame Street everyday uh well not it's not on my that's not on my list of no not it not no it's a it's not something now there was some of the some of the classes i'm in i think i'm in Sesame Street but uh yeah some of the professors i think imitate Big Bird uh oh yeah have an intellectual role of Big Bird that's pretty good that's it i mean Big Bird would make a good judge better than some of the judges i've seen oh that's true that's true yeah i've got my own pet peeve about judges but uh oh well we're stuck with them yeah yeah that we're kind of stuck with them sort of like lawyers you know oh um let's see what else is oh i like A&E i wish i wish we got i wish we got that on our cable system we don't there's always good stuff on A&E they don't have A&E on cable in Dallas well not where i am not we're we're in far north we're i mean we're uh-huh i'm thirty five miles north of Dallas in McKinney it's a small town there's only one cable system here and i've called griped about them not having A E A&E but they don't have it i mean in Dallas they do oh oh yeah i'll tell you the um uh A&E and Discovery and CNN i couldn't i couldn't live without those oh yeah i watch oh i like C i like CNN's new uh news coverage better than anybody's oh yeah i i just leave it when i'm home during the day i just leave it on just to listen to it yeah during during when the war was real hot and heavy we just had it on CNN all day long yeah best coverage yeah oh the oh much better than anybody else's yeah uh the networks got sort of ridiculous with they they they felt like they had to interrupt normal programming for all this but they didn't have anything to say now they're plus they had all the inaccuracies were ridiculous then they'd come back five minutes later and contradict themselves to oh it was just get it was ridiculous so i just oh yeah yeah yeah well the coverage was a little bit ridiculous anyway i mean um-hum it it it got far more coverage than it should have i it was it was beautifully played out thing i mean yea h oh yeah it it roused the patriotism of the of the country and all that sort of stuff and but uh they they interrupted for no good reason a lot yeah exactly i mean and sometimes they they would now i like Jeopardy and Jeopardy comes on here at seven o'clock uh-huh uh-huh and for i don't know it must have been two or three weeks there they were doing this expanded nightly news oh yeah you know and i'm going i will never get to see Jeopardy again rehash it was just rehash rehash total oh yeah i'm saying what are you telling me that you didn't tell me in your first half hour nothing and i i know i know the scud attack scud attacks are some are exciting to somebody but after you've seen them seen them for two weeks in a row nothing yeah oh well there goes a patriot missile oh well that's good that's good across the black sky a white streak yeah oh boy golly gee well maybe maybe we're a bit uh uh oh jaded yeah we are and and because television's brought everything into your living room yeah well i it was interesting it was interesting but it wasn't an exciting war it really wasn't no i mean there there there was nothing to it i mean which is that's good that's good but i mean yeah i'm happy for that for TV coverage it's pitiful i'm happy for that but but unfortunately i sort of had the inside track because i'd been in the i'd been in the military for thirteen years and i worked and i worked in intelligence oh oh and and there was no contradiction in turn yes another one of those military intelligence ha ha that's what that's just like justice for all yeah but i mean my goodness there's they're sitting here making all this big deal out of the Iranians i know and i'm sitting there thinking to myself uh-huh sure um-hum i mean they've poured billions of dollars into this stuff but those stupid people can't read comic strips i mean how do you expect them to operate tanks no they can't it's put it in Russian yeah i mean they can't even read their own language yeah it it it was just it was the coverage just went way too far yeah i it just totally ridiculous i mean the Israeli's could have fixed the whole problem years ago if they just sent sent their guys in there and killed Saddam oh that's that's what my husband says he says just send the Israeli's in to to pick off Saddam they'll they'd love it i mean that's right i mean the Israeli's aren't they're not afraid of anything huh-uh no see what happens when they when they take a plane load of their citizens down in oh yeah that doesn't uh that doesn't that situation doesn't sit around and develop very long no i just wonder what's going to happen to the hostage to the the hostages that's over in Lebanon now that you hear all kinds of things all right i i i think everybody's jumping to conclusions i don't think anything's going to change you don't think so i just no first off i don't think the the Middle Eastern situation's going to change i don't think that oh that's true oh are you kidding but they all hate each other they're not yeah they're not going to come up with they're not going to come up with a peace plan or any of this kind of crap huh-uh you know you you see them on interview they interview everybody and everybody says the same things um-hum yeah that they always have well they they get Oshmid Yakomo you know the janitor for the US Embassy and you know oh yes i know yes i keep saying when are they going to knock on my door and interview me they've talked to everybody else in the world yeah really and it was it was real it was even worse here in North Carolina because because a lot of the was it matter of fact all the units the Marines and and uh the F the F-16 squadrons came out of North Carolina did they so every night on the local news they were down in Fayetteville or they were down in Goldsboro and they were talking to the military wives you know oh yeah oh yeah and and i and i understand the way they feel about their husbands and wives being over there and all that but to get on camera and just oh this is so terrible i just i don't what we're going to do well i'm thinking to myself oh yeah you know what do these people think they were getting into when they joined the military they're they're voluntary army you know i'm going it what did you think it was uh-huh a paycheck uh-huh yeah they do they think it's a paycheck you know run around and and play soldier well the reservists sure do we had a reservist here in North Carolina who who yeah who's unit was ordered up and he refused to go we had a doctor that did t hat here i hope he got busted oh yeah she did yeah the uh this this guy did too he ended up going to Leavenworth which is good i'm glad yeah i mean just when uh the they military paid for her education um-hum and they kept having her on the news every night and then and then she that's right then she didn't want to do her obligation yeah uh-huh ooh she's she's in hot water well i you know i'm not i'm not racist or anything but one of my one another one of my pet peeves is they had a lot of Black on the news talking about how unfair it is because the Blacks are poor and therefore they don't have a choice but go in the military oh yeah oh yeah so there's more of them getting killed than the Whites oh yes now to me that doesn't make any damn sense it nobody forced so Eric what do you think um that well i'm more more interested in the long-term effects than the short-term effects in terms of uh balancing budget and so forth um yeah i tend to view um and i i take a fairly radical view towards economic policy and feel that well it has to be done somewhat arbitrarily at uh on in some uh instances i think that um goods should cost um real total costs rather than just manufacturing costs and that means uh if you oh produce something that creates uh uh adverse health effects that should somehow be reflected in the product if you uh the cost of forestry that you cut down and such needs to be uh reflected so you think that they that those products should cost more in well i think i think my long-term sense of of budget concerns is that we're going is a lot of others government's spending goes on goes towards this uh health care and things like that and a lot of causes of poor health or need for health care are brought about by various factors such as such as pollution stress you know work work environment conditions and so forth but generally the government is um-hum yeah government or individuals end up paying for that rather than the uh some of the source of need for the health care um-hum um but that's a very long-term sort of concern um i don't i don't have great short-term effects other than reducing spending and raising taxes and no one likes the idea of raising taxes very much and uh no one likes the idea of reducing spending very much so i don't see any real uh real immediate hope i mean it's the whole quota's living on debt i mean but and they buy things on credits constantly wow um-hum well do they i mean um i never liked doing that and i i didn't up until uh several years ago when it came down to the point of um-hum you you don't have a choice you know if you if you need to have a car then you have no choice and uh yeah well exactly um-hum um-hum and uh it it gets even worse when you think about trying to do things like buy a house yes well i i don't know anyone who paid cash for a house that's for sure yeah you don't have much um i really i mean so what choice do you have then i mean it seems to me one might have choices if one radically restructured the system but that's not really a possibility at this point it has it's own inertia and yeah i did it's just that uh there needs to be some some change take place so that the inertia can begin to go in a different direction and strike down yeah i hope so you know that's the problem that i think we have yeah well i'm i'm in academics and actually i'm in the job market now trying to get a professorship and i'm watching uh the education budget getting cut back so severely um at least in California where i am where there's a very severe budget crisis because of agriculture was wiped out last year and um a number of other things and uh um-hum yeah because i'm i i have a lot of i have some personal investments in this uh in addition to whatever philosophical investment um-hum there is and i don't know it's amazing that in the last ten years we've gone from a uh a major loaning nation to a major debt nation yeah in the in the course of a decade um we are a lot has changed more radically um-hum and well we were we were in debt before that it just wasn't as apparent yeah it was it's it's uh seems to have worsened considerably somehow we still i guess believed that the countries that we were helping were were eventually going to pay us back and that hasn't happened um-hum um-hum yeah well uh i can see you know it's it's it's it's kind of funny because we it seems like we loan money you know we money with strings attached and if the government changes and the country that we loan the money to um i can see why the might have a different attitude towards paying it back it's a lot us that you know we don't really loan money to to countries we loan money to governments and it's the um-hum oh that's true i hadn't thought of it that way i think and it's the governments it's the governments should that that's really what we do you don't go up to the country you talk to the president or the chair or whatever of some group and you loan it to these people who are representing the government and by extension representing the country but when those people are gone and you have some new you know starving third world country with a brand new government that threw the previous rascals out um they're personal incentive for repaying that debt is understandably low because it's they didn't they didn't borrow i mean you know it would be like you paying off the debts of uh some neighbors of yours you wouldn't feel very happy about it yeah that's true yeah that's true um so it's a sort of like this is uh i see a i don't know there's if there's a metaphor going on who are we loaning the money to and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to yeah yeah in some in some cases it uh i think it's actually going to you know the people that it's intended for in other cases uh and and this is all based and this is all up to actually the government that's in control now in some cases the the money actually does filter down to the to where it's um-hum um-hum supposed to get to and in other cases it it does not um-hum um-hum yeah i i i tend to get a little upset about loans to countries to obviously corrupt governments um yeah there a number of them for political reasons because we're enemies of the neighboring government or something like that so we give them an either corrupt government anyway but it's hard to view that so much as a loan as a bribe at that point yeah um i don't really have a good solution for the budget thing either except for that um i know that they're trying to be they're that they're supposedly trying to be fair with taxes and by making it more equal but i can't really understand why um it has to be the same percentage where you have someone that makes um a very low amount of money the same percentage may affect them thirty five or forty times more severely than the same percentage um-hum um-hum of someone's well if if they earn a great deal of money and i would being somewhere in the middle feel like that it would be a lot more fair to have a little more heavily weighted um-hum toward the top end if i i can put my you know i think to myself if i had that much money you could afford to pay more taxes i could afford to pay more taxes it wouldn't bother me a bit um-hum um-hum um-hum well boy uh i mean i completely agree with you um on the stress that the tax burden for the upper class has actually decreased over the last ten years um yeah they used to have and what do they i don't know what the percentage is now they used to be taxed thirty percent yeah it's it's and i remember hearing an interview with uh who was it the man who invented Hawaiian Tropic um-hum you know and he he was talking about that he was talking about nobody went broke over paying thirty percent um-hum well the US pays the US pays less taxes than almost every industrialized country um you know well that's they they get well it it depends on how you look at that because like Sweden they pay a lot in taxes but their day care is government subsidized um-hum yeah they they get things that they pay for women who want to stay home with their children are subsidized to do that they don't have to live um um-hum um-hum um-hum hand to mouth because it the government there and the country there has placed a very significant value on motherhood um-hum yeah i i think that's um well i think that's an important thing personally um um-hum i think we could learn some things from and the and the health care system you may pay more in taxes but your health care is taken care of and you don't have the corruption and in uh um-hum well they medicine that that we have here with the the outrageous charges and yeah i think the the Americans that i know who are are are sort of antitax a lot of them seem antitax because they're distrustful of the government will spend their money wisely and the sense is i can spend the money on myself if i gave it to the government they would just waste it seems to be an an an attitude i hear is a lot of people and i think you hear that attitude you if you go to Sweden you won't hear that as much people will say well we need those services and we're it makes our country great so we will are more willing to pay for it uh hum yeah yeah i think that if we could model you know programs after those that are already i mean they did a lot of work finding a program that worked and if we were to do the research take under advisement what they have um-hum um-hum yeah already working and adapt it that that that particular day care system um works very well and the Canadian health plan is probably the best one in existence today um-hum yeah well it uh it may not last once they i hope it does but it's uh it's uh sad situation part of this this you you hear the phrase creeping socialism hum which is uh uh a propaganda phrase used a lot against exactly such types of spending programs and um yeah you usually say creeping socialism to conjure up fears of bread lines in Moscow um but if you use i mean this creeping okay um now the term personal computer uh i don't happen to have one at home um but i do have a personal computer on my desk here a type of work station yeah uh yeah just kind of it's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to to uh shall we say bypass the formal procurement process and uh it it works just fine it says it's a monochrome monitor Panasonic printer uh no big deal it it does the things i need for it to do is it a two eighty six or three eighty six base machine no it's not even that it's eighty eighty eight uh i think that's about where it is okay uh what type of uh utilizations do you make of it word processing obviously uh yeah i do that i i do uh some Lotus on it uh do some uh Samna some uh PFM uh nothing extremely complex okay uh i use them both here at work and at home uh-huh and i have IBM clones in both cases yep here at work i have the TI one thousand which is a three eighty six base machine machine oh yeah i bet that's a pretty nice setup yes it is uh unfortunately i need all of it yep uh for example i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size wow and that i know that uh brings an eighty eighty eight machine to it's knees because i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty six machine and it brought it to it's knees yep wow just in the ability to handle and then i have uh a three eighty six FX a sixteen bit machine uh-huh at home and i'm really pleased with it uh-huh it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and uh databases database searches sure uh-huh uh what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them have you yeah yeah to try to make them more effective and useful right have you been uh struggling along those lines well um i seem to always be in the the next to the last generation of word processing software when everyone was in Samna i was still in PFM and now that i finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect so i can never quite stay current with that well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it it's uh i used it on uh some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it it was a real memory hog when you started making large block changes to it uh-huh the at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that oh of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error huh not a fun thing to try to recover from very frustrating i can believe i can believe that uh but again i've been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise uh that was a engineering spec on B2 you come here with the B level of specs no not really i'm not that up on that sort of thing well it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build oh okay uh to one level down from assistant description oh okay okay oh well it sounds like you're pretty much into computers well i sure need them uh there's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them i can believe that well it's it's been interesting yes uh maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things i think that's when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have when you start seeing what all they can do for you yeah of course needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing well i understand that you know if needs and wants were the same i'd have a four eighty six machine at home oh it is is that the newest thing now the four eighty six right that that must be a fairly recent release uh that's came out around the first of the year okay okay because i i had done capital packages for two eighty sixes and three eighty sixes but i didn't know they had a four eighty six just yet it does a few more things uh uh-huh than had been available before yeah but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement uh you know once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation sure because you no longer can think that fast anyway yeah well okay i enjoyed our discussion i did too and you have a good day you do the same bye-bye bye all right now we used to be big time campers but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports uh-huh what type of camping did you do well when we before we had kids we was in a motorcycle group you know we we went like twenty or thirty at a time we took uh just our little tents uh-huh uh-huh and we did it that way then when we started having children we bought a camper you know and we did it that way oh uh-huh oh how neat so we've always enjoyed camping uh-huh well i know i have um i just have a tent and the kids and i like to go out and camp in the tent and then i bought a van and that way i can sleep in the van and be more comfortable uh-huh yes yes now we have friends with a van and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van you know uh-huh right like one night and the next night they'll stay at the motel you know or something like that and they enjoy it yeah uh-huh yes i don't i don't think i'm a real true trooper you know when it comes to camping all the bugs and stuff but i i try oh yeah oh me either i hate to be on any that stuff but but i try you know to uh to get out there and enjoy everything but what was so fun though is that i had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends and he got poison ivy oh yeah oh and it's all over him the poor thing you know so there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at yes yes oh shoot oh but now i enjoy it every once in a while i mean it's not something i'd want to do real often i'm a sissy i either want to do it in the fall or spring you know uh-huh yeah right right definitely when it's cool well have you done much camping around Texas yes well not really because usually it's when we go off you know like for a couple weeks or so it's usually like that uh-huh uh-huh yeah well have you camped all over the United States just about wow see now i haven't so that i bet you that's an experience there just about oh it really is it really is also i said we mostly did ours before we started a family uh-huh uh-huh right right it's a lot easier then well i know my parents like to camp a lot and they uh they've been going to Gulf Shores Alabama oh uh-huh and uh which is really really neat they said they've got the white beaches and the sand and it's not real populated so they can they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean and uh from what i understand from them it's really really pretty there yes uh-huh oh i'd like to go anywhere you know i just like to go uh-huh uh-huh i really do well have you done much camping up in Kentucky and and those parts in the mountains no not really not that much um we've been well we've been to Wyoming you know and Kentucky and Montana and you know places like that but usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long uh-huh you know like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on right right but now that we have children and we go every blue moon i'd rather just go to Galveston yeah oh yeah yeah yeah rent a beach house or something yeah that's that's my idea of camping you know yes yes yes but we're uh we're getting more into it and we've done uh we've done quite a bit and uh uh the kids like to go out you know as often as they can um so that's good you know they're they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping uh-huh uh-huh it is my children really enjoys it they really do but by the time we really get a chance to it's July you know and it's so hot right uh-huh uh-huh and our camper does doesn't have an air conditioner oh yeah yeah it's one of those pop-ups i'm sure you could put one in probably but we hadn't did that uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah well that's really neat yes we all enjoy camping and they're you know they're in like R As and scouts and stuff like that you know so they get to go camping in those organizations also well uh-huh uh-huh at least their daddy goes with them i don't when they do that but yeah yeah oh that's neat that's really neat that really is well how old is your boys your children well i well i have um a son that's uh going to be eleven here pretty soon and then a daughter that's thirteen uh-huh so they're they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and cooking and and all that kind of stuff too oh yes yeah yes and that's that's really neat it really is mine's eleven and eight uh-huh so they really enjoy it too yeah yeah yeah i i agree with you they like to get out there and but this wasn't so fun this last time for Nathan to to get out there and he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy and it got all into his eye and it was really swollen and uh so they had to give him shots and everything so oh well maybe next time he'll stay away from those particular yeah yeah yes yes trees or what bushes whatever they are oh but i have uh brother-in-law and a sister you know that just really just camp you know they love to go camping they could they would all the time they wanted you know wanted to because there's nothing holding them back but i'm just not that involved in it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh no now i like to go out like several times a year but not on a on the regular basis i have some friends who go out every single weekend when you know in the season uh and and i just couldn't do that you know yeah oh uh-huh me i haven't really as far as entertainment i don't know what you would do if yeah yeah you know but i guess my entertainment's television i guess just getting away yeah right right see i see they just want to get away uh-huh but every Friday night they'll go home you know straight from work and they'll pack up and you know and then they'll leave and i'm just going you know by Friday night i just want to crash you know and i want to go home and you know do all that and then uh get out on the road to boot so oh i don't either uh-huh but anyway that's their life yes but they probably live in a city also don't they yeah yeah that's true well see we're in a real small county area and you know that makes a big difference uh-huh now that's true that's true because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles you know yeah that's true that makes a difference well it was nice talking with you okay it was nice talking to you too and we'll probably be talking to you again okay okay bye-bye okay well take care bye-bye where do you live uh in the Houston area uh-huh well i used to i lived there for a long time but i'm now in Palo Alto California which is i think the recycling capital of the world oh that's great so we have many recycling activities and i'm in in full uh support of all of them oh we are too our community is uh just starting to get organized about it they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our our things and dump them off ourselves um-hum and uh well that's something but it it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better um cooperation out here uh by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra uh actually i don't think we pay very much extra at all too but the uh garbage men uh-huh come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb i think that's great there's a few places in Houston where they're trying that out i don't know if it's the if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded uh bags and uh bins yeah we have burlap sacks and they give us one for aluminum and oh uh steel one for metals uh-huh and one for glass and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags so we have we leave three little piles of things out on the curb every Thursday and the garbage men come by and uh collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape oh that's great and the it really pays for itself because oh then the city gets the money from the recycling uh-huh yeah we're we're all for it our um we've got several bins in our on in our garage where we uh you know sort things out and and take it to to the appropriate places yeah the one thing i wish we could recycle is magazines but they claim that because of the way they're bound they uh it's too expensive to recycle them at my office we have yes two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail and they're uh one's for white paper and one's for colored paper so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or um-hum things like that goes in those boxes but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines and there's no way to get rid of them it just seems like such a waste oh it does it does but i'm sure that they can uh find some sort of uh use for them if you know you know there i've seen talk about uh using garbage for uh energy um-hum and so you know you could also apply the magazines toward that well that would be a help i wish they would do that here we have got so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade and it's really going to be yes a mess when we have to start hunting for places to put the things oh i know it we did have uh another novel uh experiment start this year now we can put all our yard clippings out you can you buy these super giant heavy duty paper bags they're about four feet high oh uh-huh and you get them for i think it's about fifty cents a piece at the grocery store um you usually buy them by the dozen um-hum and then you put all your lard yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible oh uh-huh and those and the garbage men also pick those up on Thursdays oh that's great and then the uh they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing and at the end of every year uh they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flowerbeds right well that's a great idea i wish we were that uh involved in uh or that our city was so involved in that involved in recycling yeah like that because you know i've talked to many people and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it uh if they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience i think most people would yeah oh yeah you know and i don't mind you know at first it was the the little extra money that you got you know returning the cans in and stuff like that but now you know i don't mind as long as things are getting recycled you know that we don't get reimbursed right no i think it's it's to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up uh-huh than to get that two cents when you take it to the store we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans oh i oh i know it um-hum for cash but so few people uh have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there than you get back right yes and then the plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags we have i know of one that the one that we use uh has uh recycling for the bags uh-huh and uh and they're promoting the cloth bags you know the reuse reusable cloth bags yeah well we can get a nickel a piece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused oh that's great they just take it off like they do a coupon they just subtract it from your bill oh and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags and they say you know as long as it's clean they don't want a plastic bag that's full of goop uh-huh yes here they don't want your rotted tomatoes but they want any clean and dry plastic bag so i keep and the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle so right outside the back door i've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles uh-huh and there right outside the that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers and now we've got the bag for the plastic bags i understand uh my husband about once a weekend he'll go uh to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out oh yeah and he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that he he well how nice that's great and uh it's so you know he we have all our piles of of recyclables also um-hum i remember at Christmas the the only thing that i'm when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did that was they did uh provided a place for us to take our Christmas trees um-hum uh to for them to mulch yeah for for city use and well that's they just put all our Christmas trees in the regular uh compost uh-huh pickup so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was uh three weeks after Christmas and uh-huh right uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse it would have to be cut into four foot lengths so you know if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four foot lengths but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags uh-huh well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there and they even picked up our uh styrofoam plastic packing materials they brought uh the week after Christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying we're trying something new next week only uh-huh if you have any uh of those little uh styrofoam peanuts that uh-huh any of your Christmas presents were packed in put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling and we'll uh take all of those back and try to recycle them right well see that's one but i that's not going to be a regular feature that was just a one time thing right after Christmas well the but uh something need does need to be done about the styrofoam well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills that uh oh yeah i mean they don't uh uh they don't mash they don't compress at all and they stay forever no right and i've seen where some places have taken a plastic and uh they're recycling them into other plastics um-hum and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that and i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines yeah i do too the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile it they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff right uh because otherwise uh you know they're not going to go house to house collecting it and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts um-hum right oh i was thinking about you know like the uh the styrofoam used at uh the fast-food restaurants yeah that if everybody uh and so yeah i know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of styrofoam but uh now we quit that about two years ago no three years ago when we got China mugs for everybody um so and the only difficulty with that is that we're in the middle of a five year drought and so i it's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or uh China cups to use up our water but at the moment we're using the China cups and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year and then uh you're supposed to keep it recycled every day well that's good that's uh yeah they should last a while well let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because i believe we are i i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening yep and so it'll it'll be good in the long run well i enjoyed it it sure will well good to talk to so what kind of benefits do do you have in your job that you think is uh very important health care health care like dental number one dental and medical yes yes i'm fortunate in that i was able to take early retirement from my company last year and being able to do that i was able to keep my uh health insurance that the company pays for which and i had to pick up my own life insurance uh-huh and my wife who works at the same company was able to add me to to the uh dental insurance right so i was really fortunate i really was so just this so you think that the uh a good company will provide good health i think they will as long as they can but the problem obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just going completely out of sight right i hear that's like one of the major uh the major costs to companies to corporations nowadays it is very much so it's a billion dollar problem you know every year uh our company had it doesn't apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger employees that they're having to pick up you know more of the uh health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are going up and the co-payments are going up um-hum right and i'm concerned that's just you know the beginning of it see the problem i have with it is that i don't have a job oh yeah so i don't have and i'm still in in school i'm still in college that's a problem too yeah um-hum right and so i don't i don't know firsthand of these benefits um-hum right but i i do agree with you that health health insurance is one of the major ones i don't know about dental i mean oh i dental is is kind of like uh you know you're asking for uh too much um-hum to for me i think it's like uh you know uh you're you're expecting too much from a company if something happens it happens and they'll pay you for it but um-hum um-hum to actually have you know big coverage for something like that um-hum well actually excuse me our dental insurance you know it's it's good it's certainly better than nothing it's not you know it's not super you for unfortunately in my case and you sound like a younger guy so you probably don't have it you know i do have some dental problems and it's very very expensive right i'm only twenty one and if your blessed with you know good dental uh situation you are extremely lucky you really are i've had a lot of problems i still have some ongoing problems mainly because back when i was growing up um-hum you know we didn't know about fluoride i was raised in a small rural town in Oklahoma you only went to the dentist when your tooth actually began to hurt you know there was no such thing as preventive dentistry back then right exactly yeah so the younger people you know uh are are really uh really better shaped than than people of my generation or for the most part um-hum but uh dental insurance is important to me it is not as important as uh as health insurance you know if i had to rank them as health right so uh for a health insurance what do you think would be a uh a good health insurance with a a low deductible and a high premium or do you prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible oh gosh that's that's the general you know you you know you almost need to know the family situation you know and you know number of kids fortunately i have two children and they're both grown and are covered you know under their own plans so i don't i don't have medical you know expenses for them per say uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage uh-huh i guess it also depends on how many how many times you're going to use it now we that's right that's right and also we i say we uh i'm retired from Texas Instruments and they're just they're like most everybody else you can't just you don't drop into a hospital and demand you know a thousand dollars worth of tests you know or you think you need to be hospitalized but there's only a certain i mean you can go anywhere you want to go but there's only approved uh health care centers you know that uh that they will pay you know the maximum amount right if you choose to go you know you pick up the difference according to the emergency it doesn't make any difference you can you know you can go wherever you need to go right so also they were doing for a long time they were doing the company was paying for second opinions uh-huh to doctors but they have since dropped that i guess it got to be you know not cost effective too expensive more expensive for them to do that then right so they have dropped the uh second opinion type thing but before you uh allow yourself to be admitted to the hospital you really there's a telephone number that you have to call you know and they will tell you exactly you know what they will pay for it um-hum so that that's pretty good and if you yeah if you want to so at least you you know you wouldn't have any surprises you can order any type of you know service you want but you stand a good chance you know having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself um-hum so the so i guess that if when i get a job and i and i look into the health insurance that they're going to pay for then i should really look really really deep into the policy um-hum absolutely you need about even probably the very first thing i i should look at huh absolutely do you have a family no not yet i see well it will become even more important you know when and if you do um-hum but i would really check that out because i'm concerned in coming years it's going to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks what i'm really scared about and you know i'm i don't know firsthand but i it seems to me that like you were saying earlier that the deductibles are getting bigger and bigger um-hum right and that's scary because you know in the end you're getting insurance for basically nothing that's right i mean something really really really serious has happened for you you know to to make it worthwhile and then that that that that that defeats the purpose of insurance um-hum right yeah absolutely absolutely um you know some companies can't can't even afford any longer you know to carry the insurance they're just dropping it you know they don't have any choice it's bankrupting them yeah but i'm i am and very fortunate in that i was able to retire you know with with health benefits yeah that sounds like a big big asset to do that oh absolutely absolutely same to you well it's been nice talking to you i guess i'll uh maybe see you again sometime okay you take care of yourself good luck to you thank you bye-bye you too bye an interesting uh point about sentencing by the judge alone doing away with a jury i don't know if i'd be willing to accept the um abuses that would come along with that and that the it would be relatively easy to get some bad decisions or to even get to the judge from a standpoint of bribery but yeah or even if he just through years of being on the bench just becomes uh out of touch with uh the population and he only sees the bad side of life so much that he just ends up making bad decisions however the complexity of some of these uh cases it's just they spend more time educating the jury up to the point where they can make a decision um-hum then it would take if the judge just made the decision especially when it is purely um noncriminal uh litigation type uh whatever you want to call it the term civil uh suits as it were or even some corporate uh law when there's not any individual involved and some of those are solved without a a jury but uh some some do choose to go before it um-hum yeah um what do you think about the aspect of unanimous jury when they do have a jury must all six or twelve uh agree before the the topic be final or or the verdict be final yeah that that is uh a tough situation i mean because you know i mean some sometimes i feel like maybe some of them are just kind of pressured or not really into you know and and you know uh people go home and the jury duty is always like you know kind of whining about it all seems like if people were were really you know into the subject and uh i don't know i mean i guess if there if it was more people it would be better if it was just like you know the majority but i guess the smaller number of that if it was like six or twelve which there usually are so um and i guess unanimous uh yeah i kind of agree with that okay if it the only thing that i was thinking about as far as having if you had one holdout out of say twelve yeah then is it reasonable or is it or could you assume that there must be some reason for that person to be holding out and obviously the other eleven or five cannot convince this person uh-huh that uh they should vote it one way or the other so maybe it is worth having that extra little or going to the the very farthest uh safeguard that can be done and uh yeah trying not to get a wrong decision yeah i can see that the uh system as it stands now i think if if the juries were done away with the judge could render a decision much quicker uh and you'd you'd feed more people through the courts as it were don't know where we'd put them once we got them through your courts but uh yeah i think the rate of processing is just about uh reached the rate of housing anyway so keep the keep the normal as it is can't upset the system very much yeah yeah i heard about um is is there true that there's a if a lawyer takes a a case to court and it's what do they call it um frivolous is that is there still a frivolous law that they can probably yeah i would imagine the judge could throw it out yeah but do you think he would fine the lawyer i would imagine that's left up to the judge i i would assume he could consider it a contempt of court and and uh but anything he wanted whatever his limits are on contempt of court oh yeah i never i didn't realize until recently that there was actually a fine they could pretty interesting though certainly makes sense because some of this stuff is you know you you're just doing this to do this you know it's yeah just doesn't make sense yeah so that's pretty bad a friend of mine is a is a judge here in the well actually you know it McKinney because we're in Collin County uh-huh and he is uh just recently changed from hearing all the the DWI type stuff to uh doing what they call more of a family court where he gets to go listen to all the divorces so it wasn't much of a step up as it were oh really oh really oh um it's really tough he says in a lot of cases where he has to make the decision so i guess in a lot of those cases it's it's all up to him as oppose to a jury oh gosh and there's just no good choice as to where to put the kids sometimes or yeah and of course there couples get kind of spiteful at times and oh that would be really tough and you hear it all through the worst side of people throughout the whole time yeah you really do well let me think here um as far as the judge making the decision yeah i mean because seems like i don't know i mean there's so many different different types of cases that come in i mean it seems like just general people i mean who are live in the community and do different things you know you have different opinions kind of just one judge who sits there and listens to cases all the time would would get it start thinking a certain way and go go nuts uh-huh yeah that's true but then look at the group that tends to accept jury duty you you either have the person who who is uh the type of individual who can work for a large corporation that can afford to pay them you know let them go yeah and and those are shall we say blue collar that that your work the assembly line type or technician some engineering uh you may not have the the self-employed businessman willing to go because he though he may be yeah current on all you know several social issues and have opinions on things like that he just doesn't want to take his time to go to the jury duty so he probably doesn't vote either so he doesn't get called in some counties yeah yeah so it i don't know whether it would be wiser to have an educated judge even though he may get uh out of touch after a while or whether it would be uh worth it to stick to the class of people that end up there yeah that is hard to say though i have had a judge fact this very judge friend of mine say that he uh does not like to have people on the jury that are from uh the electronics industry uh-huh and i said well me being from the electronics industry i'll bite why why don't you like it and he said well he said the majority of them uh tend to dive into their little world of of electronics and be very technically minded and be very absorbed with what their field is and they usually don't um read outside their field they don't read social type uh papers they don't they're not up to date on various uh current affairs as it were and oh i hadn't ever thought of that really and i said well that that's quite possible i said i've discussed some topics with people even over this situation and and discovered some views that i hadn't thought of in a while i just wondered if i got out of my little realm if i wouldn't run into people with some more diverse views yeah but uh my realm is pretty well technical and those who you know friends i have are usually we discuss technical items and we don't uh try to follow the world's problems yeah i guess it's too frustrating yeah it does so gosh well i think we've managed to kill a little time on the topic and we'll go ahead and yeah we'll go ahead and call you another day maybe all right well groovy it's been cool talking to you see you around bye okay bye well what is your view do you consider the Soviet Union a threat i don't know that it's so much a military threat anymore as a well you know it's it's it's real confusing right now to know what kind of a of of a threat it is i guess it it takes awhile to to get used to something sure you know if if they have completely changed the place has completely turned that much around to where they're not you know not what they used to be uh right it's it's hard to to know anymore if it's uh a threat one way or another because uh it used to be so so much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell you know rank and file in behind it um-hum and now that with Gorbachev is introducing more i guess freedoms or expressions of freedom it doesn't look as though you know everybody's following the same pattern and uh the the people who are you know the staunch military conservative people you never know well Gorbachev's future is like whereas whereas in the past it was seen as you know whoever was yeah yeah the head of uh the communist party was seen as you know untouchable yeah i think you know the the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so uh dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know we're getting uh sucked into something here you know if if somebody's about to um-hum to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know we're we're ashamed we're not going to do that anymore and uh yeah exactly um you know i'd i'd like to think that that isn't true but uh i i you know the evidence is that uh you know he's he's let some some stuff go you know the east German situation it's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible you know if i'd have been asleep for five years and read it in a book i'd say no no no that didn't couldn't have happened that way right right well it it's amazing just because of the drain it's been on you know both economies that our economy is of course been able to uh withstand that a little better um-hum but uh the Russian economy they you know they i don't know what the percentage is but i heard it one time it's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine um-hum um-hum and finally you know who knows maybe they're finally waking up and saying you know we can't afford this uh the US isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be you know even if they're saying that beneath the doors um-hum but it's hard to think that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period even if it is you know the best thing in the long run it just steps on too many people's toes who are comfortable with the way the situation is yeah yeah yeah i i think you know what i'd have to i i guess i guess to answer the question directly i'm still just a a little bit you know leery of the whole thing what i haven't seen is the uh you know a great stepping back in the military situation you know it's it's one thing you know to let us go ahead and um-hum right sort of disarm and you know i even had a thought once that the whole Iraqi thing might've been just a a deal to go ahead and let us uh you know expend some expend some military hardware of course it didn't turn out that way and uh uh that that may have been a a a kind of far out way of thinking about it i don't know uh-huh well it's interesting anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism philosophy that that was here in you know twenty years ago um-hum yeah uh but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on it have have not been world powers so it's easier for us to say you know to an Iraq you know uh you can't do this get back you know or we're going to force you whereas you know if the Soviet Union would've i don't know yeah or or we can do something about it yeah who knows what taking over Mongolia or or something like that who is really will we've been more just rhetoric uh rather than going in there officially uh or you know physically and try to to remove them um-hum yeah well the the China situation you know the when it looked like that thing was was turning around and then all of the sudden it was like somebody in the in uh Red Square or wherever said okay and that's enough and the tanks came in and you know pretty much took care of that and uh-huh exactly yeah uh that personally i don't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat and i think he's actually honestly trying to do some change um-hum but i don't believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either yeah well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward you know just some some pretty hard by the socialism and uh um-hum you know the the reaction you know the the economic well the uh the social structure of the Soviet Union you know it it's it's coming apart at the seams uh-huh you know and i've heard people say well you know it's just like the American Civil War will there be a union or not well no it's not the same sort of a thing at all because that the whole Soviet system was put together under total force you know there was no as as we are seeing now with a lot of those areas wanting out of it you know they uh nobody voted you know a lot man those people didn't vote to become part of the Soviet Union they had no choice right um-hum yeah that was always kind of interesting people you know a lot of my friends have a taken the stance of you know these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away and i'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic you know if i'm a Soviet and if part of you know south let's say South Dakota wanted to succeed you know succeed am i going to stand for that now i realize that the origins are are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with yeah um-hum uh and that they may have been forced i'm not that familiar with their future but i you know i it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than uh a volunteer or willingness to join but yeah there there was uh the whole thing was put together you know by force there's there's no no real question about that and some of the countries that were forced in at the later dates is the three Baltic countries you know came in in the forties um-hum um-hum and uh it's well it's not that they came in it's they were conquered by the Germans and then the Russians even took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back you know so that's a a little different situation and then just never given back yeah well that whole uh the whole idea idea if you look at the Russian history and i guess all countries the way it used to be is the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer um-hum and that was the whole idea of why they had so many buffers and maybe you know more and more people are seeing or countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't going to help you you can like i guess like with uh Israel is a perfect example the reason they have the Angolan Heights and the yeah the uh all their buffer area is between Jordan and uh the Sinai and and Lebanon was just as a buffer but you know as you can see with the the scuds go right over there um-hum yeah they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers yeah there's there's very little that that buys you anymore in today's technology i knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany that said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts all the bombs are going to go right over Germany and they're going to land in other places you know that's going to be the safest place to be yeah that's probably very true very that's very interesting never thought of that yeah yeah well uh i i guess what they'd have to do to uh i really don't know you know in in the uh in you know i hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears you know some reason or other um-hum you know is is uh it's kind of a strange thing we've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say whoa wait a minute you know what's uh what's what's really happening here nobody knows to do is it real uh-huh but you wonder how well this thing Boris who was it Boris Yeltsin the guy that's running the uh or evidently was elected president of the Soviet for the Russian republic which is i guess the right exactly uh the biggest i get confused between all the which is the Soviet provinces versus what are the the Russian provinces versus what are um-hum well in the center but you got uh the the great big area that's just was traditionally known as Russia and then all these little nationality groups around it you know that were you know was there nineteen of them or or whatever you know and these were all the Soviet autonomists um-hum you know they had some real fancy names for them a matter of fact when the uh right yeah what i read when the uh the uh United Nations was setup in in San Francisco one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the uh of these you know republics as a separate country you know so there'd be there'd be nineteen rather than one oh as a as a vote sure sure and uh the United States said well that'd mean we get to bring in forty eight you know and uh that sort of you know they backed down on that died down on that i thought it was interesting that recently here the Warsaw Pact no longer exists as a militory military force but it's merely an economic now yeah well i wonder if that whether uh whether whether get shot by something that's called uh an economic force or whether it's called a military pact you know it's all you can change the name of something but i wonder if it's still well yeah i mean at yeah exactly exists although i've seen some evidence that you know the uh the Russian soldiers um-hum well the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because there's they're having a housing shortages now what do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by uh Bulgaria and and Czechoslovakia and now all of a sudden they're going home and somebody's got to pay for their exactly and and all the well that's what they're saying the whole problem you know with if we were to demilitarize Europe what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there yeah well that's not what's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have uh a million plus people in the industry you know in each country from the US yeah yeah the question was uh what kind of books do you read for entertainment uh uh i guess oh i just read for escape well i mean it's okay with two little kids i can understand that yes it's that's simple i read to escape and i don't read any Parents magazines either so oh what uh what kind of well i just finished just i just finished one last night a great book it it's very a typical for my reading though but a great book one called The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien hum and it's uh God i don't know if i would call it a collection of Vietnam war stories or if i'd call it a collection of Vietnam love stories oh strange book beautifully written um-hum just beautifully written by uh somebody who was there or yeah a guy who was there as a uh foot soldier so he considered himself to be you know a a true Vietnam soldier um-hum yeah well any of the guys that were ground yes yeah i can imagine yeah so what's the latest one you've read yeah well i tell you what i'm a kind of uh a history nut i'm trying to think back now i read an awful lot of uh periodicals and uh you know almost what you call reference book and uh the last uh i'm embarrassed to say the last you know honest to gosh cover to cover book that i read i cannot uh-huh right offhand i tried to read uh one of the the Michener uh Lone Star or the the Texas History Book i have never been able to make it through any of Michener's work oh well i've had similar problems it does tend to to have you are you a Civil War buff at all yeah as a matter of fact yeah because i finished one i think this is like two years ago and somebody had given me one of these dinky do crappy women's novels set in the Civil War John Jakes one and the novel didn't do that much for me but boy the period of time was fascinating yeah uh-huh so i then read was it Battle Cry of Freedom uh-huh yeah i think it was Battle of Freedom it's kind of like a historical compendium yeah of the Civil War and it's not a story of the Civil War it's a story of all the politics and uh lobbying and just basically state by state events that led uh-huh to of the events that brought about the Civil War and it's fascinating because i had always you know have been raised on this you know Emancimation Proclamation with the Civil War uh-huh there was a lot more to it than that weren't there there was a lot more to it than that as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought yeah well it was a political move it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern oh yeah support because you know it was uh if you read it it only emancipated those who were in areas uh in rebellion against the United States all the other areas which would i think at that time would have included West Virginia and oh may have been Kentucky a few states you know that were not part of the South but still had slaves they didn't emancipate them um-hum well you know what else really surprised me now i'm married to a native Texan and i'm not um-hum uh i've got the same problem yeah i'm glad you put it that way and i have two native Texan children too my husband is always you know talked about Texas being a uh rebel state and oh my God all this Civil War pride yeah i kept waiting for where's some reference to this God damn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War they might as well have not even isn't isn't much there is there been there you know they weren't a state and the only the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to you know who's going to be going there and i keep telling my husband that and he keeps saying oh no i thought okay they supplied some uh you know they were some groups uh the Vicksburg if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg the battleground at Vicksburg uh there's an area there where there was uh some Texas uh groups and they had an interesting time there oh i'll bet they did and down there at Sabine Pass uh i can't think of the guy's name but he held off the you know just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story well you know why they actually held them off none of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar that could be it could be it now you didn't hear me say that outside of um and then the last Civil War battle was fought at Val Verde you know over there on the Texas border you had a lot of of groups heading for Mexico and they were cut off at the pass more or less at Eagle Pass and they didn't get across the river there so they're the last and that was actually after the war was over but it was the last yeah organized battle between the two units was in Texas so yeah Texas participation in the Civil War was uh minor at uh boy don't tell that to a native Texan though i mean my God they fought and won the whole thing at best yeah yeah well my wife's from Galveston so ooh yeah Well i'm from New Mexico so you know i was that's a beautiful state that's a beautiful state see i was raised in the Midwest which you know hell we didn't even you know um-hum we didn't even know where the Mason Dixon Line was and besides you know if corn didn't grow there it didn't matter it sounds like Iowa or something Iowa and Nebraska um-hum yep and then i had probably lived the last eleven years in Massachusetts so you know what does that make me an honorary Yankee or hum yeah on yeah God knows what oh well my sister's living in Illinois right now so well then she's going to come out well rounded but outside of those kind of things you know the other thing that i've really gotten into reading yeah i think this is because the kids are getting to me um-hum is science fiction i've always kind of enjoyed it i i used to read a lot more than i do now well i've gone to the point where my husband my husband travels i get out like you know two or three books um-hum and i i'm trying to think of oh Isaac Asimov Robot series yeah i mean i think i've read all four of them and i understand that there's a fifth in the last six weeks he's been on the road a lot um i just turned around and looked at my brief at my briefcase my uh bookcase up here and i see Armageddon up there and uh the Shadow of Blooming Grove and Two Thousand and Ten and Grant Takes Command and The War in the Year oh Space gee that was the one i was trying to wade through was Space James Michener didn't get very far on that you know i think i read Hawaii when i was about ten years old or so which is about the developmental level that you know you need to be at to read those things and i still even then i was so so disgusted with it i i tried to read yeah yeah i don't remember which other one it was whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller yeah and i just i got about like a hundred pages through it and realized i had like a thousand more i thought i can't do this yeah it really the the books are kind of uh imposing to say the least yeah no let's see here's one called Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of New Mexico now not too many people have read that one i don't think no and there's The History of Yoakum County Texas there is that a big thick book i've got uh yeah and i've got yeah and i've got a History of Kingsley Iowa what the what the hell for why Kingsley Iowa well because that's where my folks all came from and they had a centennial here awhile back oh okay i read the Grant Takes Command that was pretty good well that was part of that trilogy that uh Bruce Canton did now that's one that's one i don't know see i had never really been into science fiction that much until uh somebody gave me Mist of Avalon probably about five or six years ago i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy yeah sometimes it's awful hard some of those get very philosophical they can be in any setting they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting you know the well i loved that novel and then somebody said oh God this would have been even long ago because i was in Boston and it was raining all night and i had a hole in my roof and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse and uh i was reading Dune oh which seeming rather ironic yeah and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out you know like ten gallon buckets of of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and reading about these guys wearing their little Freeman Steel suits and uh-huh you're reading Dune i think that's probably my favorite of of any piece of science fiction that i've ever read and the movie was awful oh yes it was just terrible that was a movie too wasn't it was it yeah i'd i didn't see it but uh yeah it was it was beyond Patrick Stewart was in that i guess the guy that's on the new Star Trek series was in that thing uh i don't know i just remember Sting was in it oh really yeah and if you were trying to follow any type of uh uh plot it it total even having read the book and i've read that book probably three times watching that movie i couldn't figure out what they were talking about um-hum couldn't at all yeah i was real disappointed in that well i'll tell you another good book do you like scary things um well well some history books are pretty scary but yeah have you that's true have you read The Silence of the Lambs no somebody who saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they'd ever seen they didn't sleep all night ooh well see i'm i'm debating whether i want to go see the movie after having read the book i mean the book is is chilling just chilling yeah i have no idea i don't have the foggiest notion what it is about then i won't tell you okay yeah but it's just that if you're ever ever really want to just be scared out of your wits um-hum that's the one that's the one yes even better than Jaws and some of that yes because the character the the character that is so horrible is another human being And you're just drawn into his his horror of him that you begin to kind of like him yeah oh that i mean a a Freddy Kruger type huh no no This guy's smart and he's suave and he's all the characteristics all the characteristics yeah all the characteristics oh the worst kind yeah yeah so what type of restaurant do you like basically well i'm a vegetarian um and my husband is kosher so if do you know what that means kosher okay so a a lot of the restaurants we select are um uh-huh um-hum yeah based on the variety of food i don't particularly like to sort of American you know meat and potatoes type of restaurants uh-huh yeah um i i love ethnic foods i love um Chinese Indian Tai yeah now do Indian are Indian foods kosher well as long as you're not eating meat um it's to be kosher the meat would have to be kosher uh-huh right and um most Indian places don't have a rabbi the places that we eat right so um i i was about to say i didn't think so but most of the most of the the vegetarian Indian meals yeah exactly vegetables and and the same with you know a lot of people wonder do you you know do you find restaurants that will just have vegetarian meals and and even uh-huh um-hum if like you know you could go to a Chinese restaurant and eat the right um Italian you know that oh definitely Chinese would uh-huh um-hum yeah because pastas and the and the different types of sauces and things sure yeah right yeah and even um one of my favorites is El Torito's i don't know if you have that it's Mexican it's like a Chi-Chi's which is of what no we don't have one uh-huh you know my wife and you would probably love to go eat together yeah oh definitely well everytime when we go someplace they have to have good French fries really why oh yeah if they don't have good French fries you know if it's one of if it's a place that has other things if it's not that then we go to Chinese food you know i order um-hum um-hum you know a beef and broccoli or chicken or chicken and broccoli or something like that you know chicken and cashews and she orders um bean curd oh really uh-huh oh tofu and and vegetables right you know so um you two would probably eat real well together um-hum we certainly would if if uh-huh yeah she she normally picks all of our restaurants though yeah oh does she now do you guys like to go out for sort of fine dining or are you more uh well we really can't we really don't do that that often um i i guess recently we did um um-hum i get when we got engaged last summer um we went for fine dining because we were sort of celebrating and we went to the Annapolis area which is um uh-huh um-hum right Annapolis Maryland it it's uh state capital but it's also on the water so there's a lot of restaurants there it's uh it's a um oh very trendy resort type town but the my wife lived in Annapolis for a short time and uh she really liked this one restaurant it was it's French uh-huh oh but it was really good everything that was very garlicky and their big specials are things like um very fancy omelets or very fancy crepes um-hum crepes yeah and then they also have a lot of other uh French oriented uh meals and i normally get something that's crepe and very American and then she gets something French yeah but um yeah but yeah so she's the daring one in the family as far as food goes yeah definitely definitely yeah but most of the time when we go out um we either go Mexican because uh uh she just has a a need for either some type of Mexican chips or Mexican pizza or something like that or French fries um-hum um-hum um-hum you have to you have to have French fries with just about every meal unless you're eating something other you know some other uh unless you're eating like a baked potato or something right yeah in fact um since Baltimore i see i'm not a you don't know the Baltimore Baltimore's on the water and what yeah i was i was wondering if you guys eat a lot of fish um yeah um yes yeah we just had salmon last night for dinner uh but also the spices here um old bay is a spice i don't know if you're even aware of it it's what they used on the uh-huh no uh if you ever hear of the Maryland steamed crabs sure yeah i have heard of that okay well old bay is the spice they put on the steamed crabs well true male Marylander Marylander Marylander's have have old bay on just about everything they put it on their French fries they'll put it in their potato salad they'll um um-hum um-hum oh really they'll they'll put it with just my wife loves old bay with everything so if we have French fries they have to have they have to have old bay on them i see it's sort of like some people and ketchup yeah right yeah yeah well see i i grew up in Pittsburgh uh where Heinz ketchup is and my family is big ketchup yeah uh-huh oh really oh wow well you know i have a problem because i tend to find a restaurant and being on a on a tighter budget you know we don't go out to eat that much so once i find a restaurant i only want to go there um-hum right yeah uh-huh and i'll go there for you know two months straight we won't go anyplace else um-hum yeah we do the same and then you know i finally get sick of that one and then i'll find another restaurant i love salad bar restaurants because um uh-huh i find that when you order a salad at a restaurant you don't really get a salad you get like lettuce and you know what i mean and the croutons no you get a couple yeah couple yeah it's not a real meal exactly but a salad bar that's that's my favorite i mean if because i just feel like i can make my own meal and there's usually a lot of fun stuff and obviously it's a lot of vegetables but um um-hum um yeah we're the same because i'm in graduate school and we're living off her salary um-hum yeah i know what that's like uh-huh and my and my part-time work you know it's not our the restaurant our favorite restaurant in the town of Salisbury where actually we live you know where my where i'll return to my job or whatever we can normally eat out for um under fourteen dollars um-hum oh that's good and that's you know that's the two of us having unlimited unlimited French fries that's very good and uh it may be a Mexican pizza sometimes both together um along with and see it which is really funny too you know normally she goes straight for vegetables except when she's having French fries uh-huh um-hum oh really then i i'll order like a vegetable soup or something you know but she'll just have the French fries you know now is she does she like um McDonald's French fries oh okay no no in fact in we're very environmental so we very rarely eat at any of the fast-food restaurants uh just because of the um the styrofoam and the plastic waste oh um-hum um-hum yep and whatever we very rarely will eat at a uh a fast-food restaurant i will i'll eat at one more often because of graduate school and being on the road more well that's great it just more yeah i know what you mean but um yeah but she will she almost refuses you know to do that in fact we're at a point now where if we do a salad bar at the grocery store yeah we save the same plastic container and we yeah we take it with us back to the store and bring it home yeah and we take yeah oh do you but still uh-huh well you know it's funny that you say that because um our grocery store uh i personally i think the grocery stores in Rochester are very they'll allow you to bring your own like um Tupperware thing like your own container um-hum yeah to fill it up i think that's great and you weigh your container you know and then you weigh your salad after that uh-huh well that's a really good idea it really is i was very happy about that because i you know i feel the same way you do yeah um-hum yeah we we've used the same uh you know tin bottom with plastic top um-hum probably for the past oh i don't know six months oh that's great that really is good yeah so so we're very you know we try to be very environmental and and in fact it's terrible now because um i guess we've donated money to a number of organizations and you know we're in school i'm in school and we're um-hum barely surviving here and and we get calls now from like World Wildlife Federation like demanding a hundred dollars yeah oh jeez oh man yeah and when you say but we're in college uh we're in graduate school we can't afford that you know they they say well how about twenty seven well how about ten you know yeah so great how to say no and your like you'll do your own part you know you can do without necessarily spending much um-hum yeah uh-huh yeah we do all we can now but that it it you know i think that also goes along uh the reason why we pick the restaurants that we go to you know we we really have we really look at restaurants now there's one other little restaurant in town that we'll go to that is um yep yep sandwiches and chips and a pickle you know but you still and that's five fifty uh-huh but if you go to a fast-food restaurant you're going to spend four fifty and you're going to produce a lot of styrofoam and a lot of plastic so we you know we'll go there instead of you know just going to a fast-food place yep a lot more waste yeah um-hum that true uh-huh well i i don't usually resort to fast food um if i do i feel like it's a salad or something at McDonald's but i do rely on pizza a lot uh-huh yeah i do too um i mean to me either ordering in or just going to Pizza Hut or something um-hum is like gourmet i mean i just you know what i mean it's just fun it's convenient um uh the uh i don't know if you've ever heard of Pizzaria yeah i i agree yeah yeah no uh-huh okay well they just they'll do everything with pizzas as a matter of fact last night we just went there and they have a great pizza called Spinoccoli and what it is is um normal pizza but then with spinach and broccoli oh oh and it's really really good and i feel like jeez i'll tell Laura i'll tell Laura about that yeah tell her about that um and i feel like i'm getting a little bit more health out of that pizza then maybe just well i wouldn't eat pepperoni but you know sausage or something like that but um uh-huh um-hum um-hum yeah that's because my that's really see because a lot of times we'll order a pizza we'll just get a regular cheese pizza or um uh for we just recently got married so my wife so i uh-huh got a uh a heavy duty mixer like a KitchenAid or something like that it's called so she's make she makes dough pizza dough and freezes it uh-huh um-hum oh yeah and then takes it out before i get home for the weekend because pizza's probably one of my favorite most favorite food yeah and she'll make that for the weekend and she'll make you know we'll have two pizzas mine will be regular tomatoes and um really mozzarella and Monterey jack cheese you know sprinkled on it and her's will be you know something um-hum uh more gourmet but more you know with yeah more with what you like and i i she loves broccoli and spinach and i think uh she i don't think she's ever probably thought of that cashews or something like that right um-hum well Spinoccoli she can't patent the idea though because Pizza Inn already already has it but it's a it's very good well they put it they i guess they put like the dough and then the sauce and then uh-huh yeah so it's it's just regular it's just tomatoes uh-huh do you have a favorite basketball team Lakers the Lakers LA yes i'm from LA okay uh how they doing this year i'm not i haven't even been following them very much they're okay they're not um out of anything yet they're still hanging in there i know they lost recently to the Bucks in Milwaukee yeah that's that's where i'm from so yeah yeah that's about the i like the Lakers and uh Mavericks are okay but they they got a lot of problems Mavericks do have problems without Roy Tarpley they're not going anywhere and see i don't think they should build up on one person like Chicago with you know with Michael Air Jordan and that's not good Lakers got so many different players yeah they do they always seem to get the talent there um-hum i guess that's why i like them well they i think yeah i think Milwaukee got lucky because Magic Johnson sat out that game yeah yep i'm not too much of a basketball fan but you know i watch a lot i watch different games like uh-huh play-off games and stuff like that do you think the Lakers can win the championship this year no not since they're coach is gone you don't like Mike Dunleavy no yeah he didn't they didn't let him have quite the the flair that uh Mike Riley had huh-uh Mike Riley was it and that's well Dunleavy's a good coach though he was he's good it's just he's not he's not Riley and i think that's the biggest problem is eventually they're going to have to figure out what they need to do and catch on to each other yeah well he doesn't have that Hollywood attitude huh-uh would uh no i'm pretty familiar with with Dunleavy because he was an assistant at Milwaukee oh was he uh yeah and he uh when when they had uh injury problems with some of their major players uh he actually put on a uniform and went out and played oh my goodness they they signed him to a ten day contract and uh he became a player even though he's assistant coach huh-uh that's all right then the guy knows basketball i think he'll do all right for the Lakers huh boy you you like basketball though don't you oh yeah oh yeah it's fun i'm watching the i'm i'm busy watching the NC double A tournament uh the past couple weeks uh-huh and the NIT semifinals are on tonight yeah see now i watch the the Final Four uh-huh once it gets down to like the Final Four yeah right so are any of those teams of interest to you UNLV i like them oh yeah well they're they're just i guess because well that guy is from Dallas that's probably about the only thing yeah that's it that's the only reason why i don't know anybody else Larry Johnson right well they're just head and shoulders above everybody else this year are they really oh yeah they're they're so much better than anybody else it's uh that they're prohibitive favorites in winning all their games but then you know just like that man said in this final in these in the NCAA whatever it is the little play-off games they play so many sometimes i do think it's going to be more it's luck and ambition you know right well it's it's just unbelievable how many games they play in in college now Arkansas played thirty four games this year that's almost half of a pro season yeah see that's that's too many games it's too many for students you know and and then they supposed to be studying right you know they're talking tonight about this NIT game with Stanford and Massachusetts that the Stanford players actually took their final exams while they were on the road playing basketball uh-huh are you serious they have an honor system there where they would they had uh three hours to take their exams they sent them in by uh by fax and uh i guess by they used laptop computers to uh to get their exams finished uh-huh hum send them out by Federal Express and fax machine i don't think that's good yeah it's incredible that uh that they have to do that i mean some of the the schools give you a break they give the students a break where they can take their exams when they get back from from a tournament uh-huh but uh these guys were actually on the road uh two thousand miles from from home when they had to file their uh their final exams and send them in yeah i don't think that's i don't think that's good yeah that and then you know the laptop that's how i guess they really stuck it on a disk the teacher you know with no answers and they could take it like that and then just print it out in fax and it would be okay because you can put it on a you know on diskette yeah and just have them take it but then who's helping them yep i don't know so do you think uh you think Vegas is going to win the finals then see now that's yep i think so too they plaid Duke and uh Duke has a lot to uh to atone for here last year that lost to Vegas in the finals by thirty points in that the other one that upset that was an upset was Kansas last night Kansas is a real surprise i didn't expect them to get that far when they yeah i didn't think they was going to beat that team i don't remember the team but they shouldn't have beat them uh they beat Arkansas yeah i didn't uh yeah that that i like i like Arkansas Arkansas just uh they had a rough second half yeah they came out uh real hot in the first half Todd Davis hitting his three pointers and it was like they just died or something you know yeah uh somebody took the fire out from under them they they weren't getting their shots anymore huh-uh and and Kansas just crept up on them and uh uh it was unbelievable because they they did that a few years ago too when they were seated a lot lower and they won the the championship that's it um-hum see now that's the that's the thing now but i don't think they everybody's waiting for UNLV yeah well they they are just that much better they've got so many stars and see if Kansas if Kansas yeah but then you know it could be what if they're not hitting that night or they're low or anything and see i i feel like the college you know it's kids it's still kids well sure i think anybody can can win on a given night but they have so much talents and the average age on that team is twenty two years old they've got a lot of fifth year seniors that are playing so yeah they just take them out think that that'd be all right guys that are playing for long time uh they're playing Duke uh this weekend uh the average age on Duke's team is nineteen years old um-hum um-hum Vegas the average age is over twenty two so they've got just so much more experience than anybody else in the tournament right now but they're going to lose all those guys at the end of the season they're going to all turn pro i think Stacy Augmon's a senior and Larry Johnson i don't think i think he's uh is he a senior or junior yeah who i'm not Larry Johnson i think he's coming out this year he's yeah he's coming out in the pros this year uh-huh and Anderson Hunt all their uh their best players i think are graduating um-hum well maybe not graduating but at least they'll be entering the the pro draft i don't i think i think he's going to move i think he'll probably go he now Larry Johnson is definitely going to the pros oh yeah for sure yeah and uh there's some more that i don't i can't think of their names God my girlfriend she she gets me because i can describe them go you know that guy you know and she'll name them for me George Akals and Stacy Augmon yeah now they'll come out in the pros Anderson Hunt they'll come out uh-huh they're half they're team is going to be gone now and see that's another thing for next year with UNLV they're not going to have no team uh well i wouldn't say that i i think well i mean as far as the the top players you know like the ones they have this year you know yeah their coach may not be there i think Jerry Tarkenyon may be headed for the pros yeah he's nice there's some talk that he may be uh coaching for the LA Clippers next year uh the Clippers that's another team and i don't think they've ever done anything they have a great amount of talent but they just have poor coaching i think but um no coaching yeah that's all right they've got some great players on that team that be all right between them and i just think that yeah then there's that uh let's see i like the Lakers Milwaukee Atlanta Hawks i like them too uh-huh i like probably uh the Houston Rockets shocked me the the i think it was last year when they uh last last year they beat LA last year uh-huh well Houston's playing really well lately yeah last couple of weeks anyway since Akeem because i know my sister's in LA see and she calls me up and tells me well LA's going to come down there and beat up on Texas you know and i said yeah and so when they came down so what happened it took them a long time they beat them uh-huh but it was like four out of the three seven games they had to play the seven games for the for the thing you know just to beat them so it was like one game over sure i think Houston's playing really good ball lately uh-huh ever since Akeem changed his uh first name to Hakeem he added the H to the front his attitude i don't know i don't know them people well uh i can understand that it's uh i don't know why he dropped it in the first place but uh i don't either if it was his name he should have just kept it i you know that's your name that's your name sure so who do you think's going to win the NBA this year hopefully i don't think the Lakers are going to win but i think um oh what's his Portland Portland's looking awfully good no not Portland what's that team with the little guy with uh the no Isiah Isiah Thomas Detroit yeah Detroit Pistons they're not as good as they were last year i don't know i think they'll go i think they'll they're good but they're not great but i think they'll they'll have to pick it up in the in the tournament then but i think that's what usually happens to them Chicago's playing really good ball with Michael Jordan um-hum and i think they finally put things together yeah they did good last night last night they had like a hundred and something to eighty so they they was playing real good last night yeah well Chicago they they've been struggling last couple of years and they've had a good team for the past few years ever since they had Michael Jordan but they never did seem to make an impact on the play-offs yeah i think this year they're going to really uh show some talent i think also because they done took some of the pressure off of him oh yeah you know they because they always think it's all him and see there's not you know it's not true they have a good supporting cast that's not good but i mean everybody's always looking at him that's just like Larry Bird and um uh God Larry Bird what team does he play for Celtics Boston Celtics right yeah see because they put a lot on Larry Bird um-hum yeah i don't think the Celtics quite have the overall talent that it takes to win the NBA this year hum-um they've got good individual players but some are getting old Robert Parish is thirty seven years old yep he's still playing center and uh Larry Bird's talking about retirement here i guess in another year well he's out i mean he's hurt this year yeah so you know you never know but they're bringing in some good young players too yeah which is good um-hum i'm i've always favored Milwaukee being from that area and they've made some good moves in personnel but i don't see them as having the the type of talent that will win the NBA this year yeah they have to get by Detroit and Chicago i think either one of them is a real tough challenge for them yep if they get by Detroit i think they can get by by uh Atlanta but yeah i don't think Atlanta would be much as much a problem as Chicago well that's what i meant yeah they get by Chicago hey can get by Atlanta uh-huh it would it if you can beat Chicago Atlanta shouldn't be that much different right you just slow down Isiah Thomas and Atlanta is um they got what um i think uh i like to listen to a program called Focus on the Family with Doctor James Dodson uh-huh okay and from what i understand it's it's a new thing good about families these days um especially spending time with one another i know if if i were to have children i would have trouble yeah because i work and uh i have my dogs and i have a hard enough time spending time with them you know yeah i i'm i'm pretty busy myself i'm in graduate school at State and i uh-huh i can't see even having time for a pet let alone children yeah really but um there's a lot of single parents too that are trying yeah i think day care seems to be uh yeah a real big issue yeah and uh i'm not sure or i just wonder when we'll know what the effects of day care yeah well actually there's been some studies that say it has some positive effects that the students the the kids get you know exposure to other kids their age at an earlier time yeah so they tend to be more cooperative with their peer group although they don't have real good uh role models yeah i've heard that they they call them uh that they say that they're more um creative that they're really just more rebellious um-hum from the day care yeah because uh the people don't have the time to give that one-on-one attention yeah and and i just wonder if maybe day uh the home schooling is going to come into more and more uh homes i can i can see that happening yeah because really if you have a good curriculum yeah do you really need to have that certification yeah of a teacher i taught i taught school for a year and it was like whoops you know it's not for me no because i i just don't have that discipline with children that uh you need for them to learn right um-hum and uh i one day i was i like found myself uh telling them to write their spelling words a hundred times each and i just heard this comedian say that you know something that that's how you know you're a bad teacher um and i was doing it just keep them occupied yeah i think another problem with the families uh is is the role of television yeah um i don't know it seems they're using it as a babysitter instead of a learning tool that really that really annoys me because i think i don't know i think my parents probably did that to me a little bit yeah um using it as a baby a babysitter yeah it's just go watch TV you know leave us alone yeah will numb you out which well i've i've heard some uh there's a book out now called The Saturday Morning Mind Control um-hum and uh he raises some serious questions about why do they have these really a lot of money goes into the advertising for children's programs oh yeah and yet uh children can't buy uh what's the deal yeah but they can they can whine and squeal and complain right i'm watching Ninja Turtles i know it yeah and boy the price of toys these days is ridiculous yeah i could be and they all have to have the same one you know i can see having kids and not letting them watch TV and making them toys out of wood say oh yeah here kid this is this is all you're getting i wonder how long that last well i i used to babysit for this family that didn't have a TV and their their kids turned out fine they didn't have a TV at all they they had no TV were they Pentecostal no i mean they had a nice stereo they listen to stereo they were into Michael Jackson yeah they just yeah they just didn't watch him on TV yeah which i thought was pretty neat yeah it is it's very good i think TV has really had some bad effects on all of us especially the the violence on it i've yeah yeah and you can't control it you you know it's the cable channels sometimes you can but yeah boy the cable TV they'll just show anything yeah and that's coming right into your homes yeah i think TV can be good if if the family watches it together on they're watching good shows uh-huh yeah PBS or whatever i mean even some regular network TV is okay if the parents there and you know helps the students or help the the kids understand that yeah this that happened in the TV show but probably doesn't happen in real life yeah yeah and there's a lot greater instance of uh children committing murders too isn't there yeah killing their parents and so forth they don't they see these things happening with no consequences huh you know yeah you see it on TV The guy gets up and lives afterwards yeah yeah like Double O Seven he's supposed to do it yeah and it's okay yeah so i you going to have kids in the future huh you going to have kids in the future no huh-uh because i'm like forty three okay and so it's uh it's too late yeah you know i wonder sometimes wonder if i'll ever if i will regret it when i'm old but uh i just can't see myself as a parent uh-huh yeah you know it's i'm still pretty young i'm twenty five but i don't know i don't see it for for at least a few years really are you married no i'm single right now and i'm you know sorting things out which way i'm going to go with my life before i yeah have kids you know career to to much into my career you know yeah well i wish you the best okay well it's good talking to you it's good talking to you bye-bye all right bye-bye okay so what do you think about us getting involved in the Middle East i don't think we have any choice oh i don't think we did really either as long as we do it in a logical manner rather than what we did in Vietnam except jack around with it well that's that's true yeah the uh the the biggest difference i got to agree was the idea that we were allowed to go and get it done rather than than set up a a line and say we're not going to let you cross this this point anymore and that really hurt the uh the people uh the Vietnam experience uh i got to admit that one i think uh basically what we're going to have to do is now that Bush has made the made the stand is what we'll have to continue to uh stick up for our foreign policy if we don't then what's going to happen is that everybody well it's just a one time shot they're not going to do anything uh-huh well do you think that um by uh going over there and doing what we did that uh it's going to give us a chance for peace over there i don't think there's ever going to be peace in in the Middle East yeah that kind of mostly it it just that that region never had peace even as far back in biblical times it's never been peaceful well that's um-hum you know the Arabs just don't like the Jews and the Jews don't like the Arabs and then half the Arabs don't like the other Arabs but is i mean is that any different than uh the way it is in even our country i mean uh back in the fifties and forties the blacks didn't like the whites the whites didn't like the blacks but we're getting to the point where we get along pretty good i mean isn't it logical that just any of the that you can solve differences like that no because you i i don't think the Mideast has the educational background i i i don't think they're later they're rate of literacy is so low that they're still they still have a trouble mentality so you um-hum so you think it comes down to education or or something like that well well you don't find many intelligent people starting wars you know i suppose that's probably true you know uh basically the more intelligent people do not want to fight one uh because they've already been there all you have to do is go fight one and find out it's not much fun i've spent uh over twenty eight months in Vietnam so and i mean it's not it's not a lot of fun um-hum no oh um-hum uh it's as years go by it becomes more fun now than it was twenty eight years ago you know but uh yeah because yeah i guess the uh you kind of think about the good things and not about the bad and you forget some of the smells and stuff like that but i think you know probably the probably the Middle East is if you have too many tribes mixed up with troubled mentality not only the Mideast but also in in the what they call the emergency African nations the third world um-hum um-hum right right uh as soon as one tribe gets the power they just knock off they're old ancestral enemies and it's pretty you know it's pretty much that way over the Mideast and you have the Palestinian question and there hasn't been a Palestine over there for God since you know two hundred years three hundred years before Christ was born and but but you have people that are suddenly coming out of the woodwork going oh yes we want a Palestine nation but there hasn't been one for you know well over two thousand years um-hum but you have this troubled mentality they all you know like the Kurds or the Shiite Muslims or whatever but it's basically all all based on the a a tribal network right well isn't it also though based on religion i mean isn't that a a real powerful out of some degree yeah to some degree but uh religion is a factor over there but uh i think the strongest factor is a tribe of the family um-hum well don't don't you think though that uh because of religion it just enhances the differences uh of the tribes and makes it so that it's that much harder to get along well they have the same problem we do yeah i mean you know everybody there's Christianity and then you then we have subdivided Baptists and Lutherans and Protestants and Christians and Catholics and stuff it's basically all the same um-hum uh but but the Muslims are not as liberal in their interpretation of of the Kuran as we are in our interpretation of the Bible right right you get the more the more i guess you call the more militant sect of the Shiites who you know if you're not a Muslim and and you don't adhere adhere strictly to it then you're nothing and you're just you're you're just getting lip service much like uh the Ayatollah Khomeini um-hum he's a he's a prime example oh i'd i i will but seriously doubt that that you will have peace in the Mideast as long as you have so many war infections that are they can't even agree on which facet of of uh Muslim they want to follow that's true well since there's not going to be peace over there don't you think like getting involved as we have that that's going to mean that we're going to be involved from now on and so any war that breaks out we're going to have to be in the middle of it well we only we have two choices we can be involved or not involved if we're not involved then we're going to be sitting over here freezing in the dark um-hum uh we probably could with ultimate fuel supplies and uh some relaxation of our old uh policies here survive but we're not going to do that it doesn't seem that way does it no there's there hasn't been any real you know alternating energy situations situations or or sources played out nobody wants to do it somebody has to make the hard decision and whoever does that will be a one term president um-hum yeah i know yeah it's kind of like uh Texas income tax whoever you know whoever puts that up is going to serve one term that's going to be it because your going to be gone they may pass the uh state income taxes but that'll be the last thing they pass yeah that's probably true nobody actually wants to make the hard decisions have to do is basically what we're doing now is pick some of the moderate uh Arabs or um-hum you know Muslims as and uh support them because they're because they will have more uh encounter with us as far as the educational and sociological economic background goes um-hum if you look over there you're not going to you don't see any Arabs driving uh hum racing cars they want Mercedes or Cadillacs or Lincolns true they want the the gas guzzlers yeah yeah so you know who's who produces those the US produces those and i think after the war no that we're not going to see a bunch of the Arab nations buying Russian equipment because the Russian equipment has gotten blown out of the sky or off the ground um-hum didn't it though yeah i i got to agree with you there i think that does get a lot a lot of good there you know and uh we we pretty much proved our worth in combat as it were and um-hum where did they get the uh where where does the expertise come for for bringing a whole lot of ground and it doesn't doesn't come from Russia and it doesn't come from Europe it comes comes from the United States um-hum who's going to put out their oil fires the United States hum United States right we have the technology when we have the people and we go do it and i think we're going to i think we're going to be a president in a a presence in the Mideast from now on um-hum let's say i'd have to say overall that the the war was was beneficia l to the United States with with the change in attitudes and all that you know all that stuff i mean it's people think better about uh the US now and that's really going to i think eventually come back and and help with overall business standards i mean people are going um take more pride in their work and things like that i think it's going to really help out overall i i i agree a hundred percent on that after after after all you know i mean everything Bush said Bush put down a deadline if if it wasn't meant to be one he'd attacked yeah um-hum and that's the way you're supposed to do it instead of doing like Jimmy Carter did you know say well you know uh um i'm getting out of the olympics and i'm going to give you back Panama yeah you know i mean you either make your stand or you don't if you can't back it up just don't say anything um-hum that's right and everything Bush said he backed up of course he course he had some real good help um-hum oh yeah he had some excellent military people yeah it's like and like Collin Powell and the rest and uh yeah Dick Cheney those people were real smart they're a lot smarter that any body gives credit for i i was the person i was impressed with most i mean i i really you know Colin Powell and and General Schwartzkopf they're military people but i really didn't know that Cheney was as military minded as he is i mean Cheney's hard core you don't get to be Secretary of Defense by being a wimp that's right i well he was what uh a Senator from Utah or something like that i can't remember where but he'd served in the military yeah and see i don't know that and it well you know i was real impressed with his handling of this i know that oh yeah the whole i mean the whole thing was done well it was just you know oh yeah it was uh of course he had to fight that to beat microscope anyway um-hum but i hesitate to call it a war since i mean it was i guess it was i'm not used to having them over in six days you know just kind of gosh we just got started good i guess the Israelis might be over it you know uh you know because they had a seven day war at one time but uh i don't think very many people are yeah um-hum although i i wish instead of turning south you know and taking a right turn and going down Kuwait City i wished we'd just turned left and gone toward Baghdad yeah there was uh there was a lot of talk about the idea that the even the uh Iraqis themselves the people wished we would have done that uh i think we should have because because we're going if we don't do it now we're going to have to do it shortly yeah well unless they finally do take care of it themselves but you know you kind of have to wonder whether it's going to be any better with uh you know depending on whether it Shiite Muslim or uh or the Kurds in power but uh you know but the only thing that'll save that is we won't get the credit for or the blame for the massacre and and then if we do have to to go back in it will be because you know someone asked us to well that's true too yeah um-hum and of course now's the time to do it because since we have the army over there i'd sure hate to you know spend eight months pulling them out and then turn right around send them back over again um-hum yeah that's true yeah especially the cost of that and and uh uh the attitudes of the soldiers i mean they're there they i think they could handle it better but if they came back and then had to turn around and go the attitudes would be just horrible oh yeah they shouldn't leave anything in Bagdad taller than three feet yeah that's probably true they just you know just just level the whole place and let it go but we're going to have to be over there and we're and our presence is going to have to be felt and they've got to be strong presidents or presence uh if we don't then i think that we're going to be back there um-hum you know in the Jimmy Carter uh Carter era you know wringing your hands and going trust me trust me so do you think it's you do think it's a good idea for us to have uh okay the topic said to discuss the weather what is it like where you are and how's that different from normal and well i tell you what it is it's warm where i'm at well let's see if you're in Plano and i'm in Plano are you in east Plano or west Plano uh west Plano okay well i'm in east Plano i'm out in Las Rios so it's bound to be different over here but yeah yeah okay good deal well i tell you what uh yesterday i went out and played a little golf and uh i paid the price my neck got got burned to a crisp oh got a little sunburn yeah yeah but uh it was it was beautiful out wow i worked around in the yard a little bit and i've got sunburned a few years ago and you know got one of those what second or third degree burns and the doctor looked at it and said don't ever oh Lord don't ever let that area get sunburned again yeah and uh it's got the you know the kind of the black freckled things on it that the doctor looks at every once in a while for that what melanoma business right exactly so i am super whenever we go down to Galveston to the beach or something like that you know i look kind of stupid i'm out there in a T-shirt and everything else all covered up pretty much covered up but uh you know i'm never going to let my shoulders and back get sunburned again well i tell you i'm the same way i tell you i i knew better i should have put some sunscreen on uh yesterday but i don't know it felt so nice out um-hum well it is March after all you know you're not supposed to worry about sunburn in March well that's right that's right they shouldn't even be selling suntan lotion yet that's right but uh hopefully uh you know it's going to stay warm for this weekend yeah and uh well yeah i hope so yeah we're going to go to Lubbock they'll probably have another sandstorm out there you know so you're going to go to the big city of Lubbock huh yeah big Lubbock yeah are are you a native type Planoite or you been here a while or no i just been uh up here in Plano for about uh i guess close to three years now and uh okay well well where did you come from originally i grew up in a small town right outside of Amarillo and uh then when i went to school at Tech there in Lubbock oh okay well i'm a Tech graduate so are you okay yeah i grew up over in New Mexico at Roswell i see and my wife is from Plains if you know where Plains is i've heard of Plains yeah it's on the it's on the road where do you know where well you go south out of Lubbock down to Brownfield and then you like you're headed over toward Roswell Plains is right there right uh about fifteen miles in from the New Mexico line i see okay so so yeah you talk of little towns in west Texas yeah i'm well no see i'm from a town named Panhandle okay yeah i know where Panhandle is that's north up there isn't it yeah yeah yeah right right right up there by Amarillo yeah so uh yeah i had a friend who lived in Dumas okay yeah on the other side of Amarillo yeah so yeah so anyway yeah we're kind of familiar with that part of the world now there's where the weather's interesting i think it's kind of dull around here compared to well that's right because uh one day it'll be eighty and the next day it'll be about thirty below i tell you what and uh yeah my mother still lives in Lubbock and we talked to her the other day and they said Friday they had or Thursday or Friday they had a you know one of the world class sandstorms out there that happens every once in a while hadn't had one like that in a couple of years oh Lord that's one thing i do not miss about uh being in Lubbock i tell you because one i i'll never forget uh one spring we had a real big dust storm come in and it started raining and uh it was like raining mud out there you know yeah i recall a snirtstorm out there one day where about this time of year that there was a big cold front coming in and they got the dirt up in the air and then it snowed a little bit and uh oh Lord and uh i can imagine that happening more in Amarillo than i could in Lubbock but still anywhere out there it could happen right that's exactly right i tell you yeah i we like i said i grew up in New Mexico we lived in Albuquerque Karen and i both lived in Albuquerque for quite a long time and then i went to work for TI here right and i came here in sixty nine and then seventy two they opened or seventy three they opened up that plant out there in Lubbock and uh man that was like going home and uh so we went out there were there for about ten years until that all folded up out there i see ended up coming back but uh yeah the weather out there was uh-huh it it could get a little bit a little bit interesting now and again oh it sure can because uh the you never just you just can never tell what it's going to do uh-huh and uh it's just hard to plan anything well if you've been here for three years you didn't get here the year they had the big freeze and stuff here did you what was that eighty eighty four uh that i did this okay oh wow that would have been six or seven years ago then yeah uh my first year down here uh uh that first winter i remembered TI was closed one one day uh um-hum with the ice yeah that yeah with the ice but that uh that's about the worst worst winter i've been been through down here well the uh was it i guess it was three years ago that they had the real right before was it right before Christmas or where yeah where it got just real real cold yeah yeah got down to around zero somewhere and then warmed back up and killed everything off yeah right yeah that was that was bad news we're still try i set out a whole bunch of crepe myrtles and stuff and of course it killed th em oh Lord well they all come back from from the bottom right so i'm getting kind of convinced that if something doesn't grow naturally here there's no sense in planting it because eventually you're going to lose it that's right because the weather's going to get it exactly and you noticed all the pretty little trees that are out everything now the native trees that still don't have the leaves on them yet that's right that's exactly right they're they know better they know better yeah yeah and uh my wife and i are going through that process now we just bought a house and we're trying to decide what we want to do with our landscaping and we still have to put a yard in um-hum um-hum and uh i'm still trying to decide when when the best time's going to be to do that so uh yeah well you're just about there i think it's that's that's right you know i'd i'd like to get the yard in before all the rain start and uh you know if we could get it up a little bit then the rain would really just help it um-hum well we moved into this house it was a year old and the landscaping was semi-in but there was still a lot more to do i see and one of the things that uh well they were really selling everybody on back then was this Indian Hawthorne boy you know that's the best stuff in the world right well i am somewhat less than enthused about that i've got some out here that's five six years old now and still doesn't look a whole lot different than the day that i put it in oh is that right and i noticed that a lot of the garden well you know that Indian Hawthorne that didn't work out quite as well as we thought you know so now they're pushing something else right oh Neil Sperry hasn't been pushing that real hard and heavy here lately yeah yeah well anyway uh like i said if it if it doesn't grow out in the woods here somewhere i'm not sure that's worth planting huh that it's worth planting yeah that's exactly right this uh photinia the red tipped photinia red tipped bush yeah it seems to do pretty good we've got some here that's really taken off well yeah i i i know everybody in our neighborhood has has those bushes and uh um-hum like i say really seem to to do well that and uh the little dwarf yaupon hollies you know they they seem to or just yaupons period seem to do all right right holley yeah right we've got a couple of Live Oaks in the front yard and of course they're they weren't native to this particular spot but they seem to have done pretty good and they sure have and that's a good tree it sort of stays green most of the year you know and and uh yeah it's it's it's a strange one it will kind of scare you if you don't know what it's doing because right now is when it's dropping it's leaves right and you go out there and look at your tree after a good windstorm and the thing is bare and you think oh no the thing's dying but you look look real close and there's all the little new leaves getting ready to come out so it holds it's leaves all winter then loses them in the spring right yeah that and that red what is it red oak red oak yeah we're thinking about putting one of those in only thing is those things grow pretty slow you have to uh-huh well you know i heard something about that here whether Neil uh here again it may have been Neil Sperry they say you know everybody looks at these oaks and says yeah they grow slow and all that right but most of the time that's the way that the native ones grow because they don't get the water they don't get the they're they're growing under bad conditions oh is that right yeah and uh if you bring one in and put it under good conditions they'll grow about as fast as any tree so if you really fertilize it and huh well that's surprising so yeah that's good to know so anyway that's that was i guess he was talking about some of the other kinds of oaks i don't know right right whether the live live oaks is not really an oak i guess it's something oh i think it's just by name yeah yeah it just got the the name of being an oak because it's got a kind of an acorn kind of thing on it right right but uh i think the real honest to gosh oaks like the what bur oaks and pin oaks and red oaks and all that sort of thing they they'll grow a lot faster yeah huh well i guess we were supposed to be talking about the weather but that's at least we had a good conversation anyway yeah yeah well are you you with TI but uh yes i am yeah yeah how many these have you gotten very many of these calls at home um probably about three i guess yeah okay well i got the first one this evening that i had gotten at home i i see i'd made a couple at work you know made made several from work but i'd never uh i'd never gotten one yet i was just right gotten one at home huh yeah i've gotten about three i guess yeah yeah so well you know you'd think that this crazy system if you're going to talk about something about the weather they'd have tried to plug you in with plug you in to somebody split it up a little bit like you know New York or something yeah like New York or somewhere yeah that's right yeah weather difference between east and west Plano but uh exactly clear across town but uh clear across town well when we lived in Albuquerque there was such a elevation difference there that there was a weather difference between the valley and the heights right you know it would be snowing up in our area and then the sun would be shining and it would be hot down in the downtown but uh that's not the way Plano works well how how do you feel about the immigration laws at currently i think they are a little restrictive uh particularly for uh certain ethnic groups or from certain countries um i think we should permit uh more immigration from eastern Europe for example uh particularly the uh the Jewish uh uh people from Russia i think we could permit more of them in than we have uh permitted in the last uh several years and i think we have uh uh too much restriction on the uh on the Orientals also but of course that's just my opinion yeah well i'm not real sure why i got this topic because i don't think i checked it off on the list because i know very little about the current immigration laws um-hum um-hum well we seem to uh to favor certain uh uh countries particularly South American countries and uh there is no uh uh i have nothing of course against uh the uh the South Americans or uh or Hispanics in that sense but i think we uh are more restrictive of the um so called eastern uh European countries than we uh uh we should be of course that's from my own bias since my ancestors from Eastern Europe so oh and uh so i think uh you know the um embargo we placed on the uh on the Russian Jews although we spent of uh spent years and years uh lobbying for their release and their ability to um immigrate from Russia as soon as that occurred we uh-huh simply said that uh instead of the uh hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country we cut that by uh two thirds so hum i do not quite go along with that but no that doesn't make a whole of lot sense no and i still think you know again kind of having uh uh within this century come from a uh uh an immigrant family or immigrant families on both sides both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants so um-hum i'm a little touchy every now and then about that yeah well uh my uh my family is from uh Europe from well from England and Ireland um-hum and uh have been in this country for oh more than a hundred and fifty years almost two hundred years oh my so i don't have any any uh relatives that i am or or uh several generations back that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family they were all they were all born here uh-huh so i don't have any real strong ties with any with with the immigration laws i don't because i don't i don't have any personal feelings about them and i i haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are well i think in a way though uh uh i also have uh an opposite point of view which is uh although i believe we should uh permit uh you know constant immigration into this country um uh-huh i think we should uh primarily for economic reasons i think we should have um some quotas of course my family and i again again that was you know my uh grandparents came over during the time when uh there were quotas so they had to wait uh you know in uh certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over uh-huh so you know but uh yeah i i i think unrestricted immigration i think is not uh is not best uh well i agree with that i i think if immigration was entirely unrestricted uh not only would would the United States become over populated well more over populated awfully quickly i think it it would bring in a lot of uh people that are run out of other countries or in trouble in in other countries i think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their their brand of crime um-hum well you know there's another aspect of this too they're also uh uh diminishing the uh health restrictions which i was not aware aware of that well yes there are were some uh regulations over i don't know whether they're laws passed or or whatever they're called uh just recently where uh people with certain diseases cannot be excluded uh from immigration AIDS is one for example and uh recently uh tuberculosis which at one time if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country uh they dropped that also uh-huh so i think in in some some aspect some ways we are uh becoming a little too egalitarian in that in that sense but uh i think we should be a little more circumspect about it again my opinion yeah think we've talked long enough i think so all right well i've enjoyed talking to you or i i i have talked long enough okay thanks thank you bye-bye good-bye okay let's see i think uh i guess since i call i'm supposed to start i think that's the way everybody has done it so far okay but anyway i i think that um we are paying a lot in taxes but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms and we have a lot of things that uh you know the governments doing with our money um we're probably one of the the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have the you know as far as the quality of the streets the school systems um the hospital stuff that the the government gives money to um the you know all the things that the government does like that i uh i think they need to manage it a little bit better but i don't think uh anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks because they've been messing it up for many years now so yeah well i have to agree that and and you're right i mean we you know we do have a good government we do have a lot of things that you know show that the taxes are there to support but i do think they're mismanaged and i think that sometimes it's too easy of a i don't know to easy of an answer it seems to the politician to say i'll tax them if you can't get enough money instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or or you know get all of the waste out of the spending um-hum um i don't know what y'all are paying in Dallas but you know it seems like we pay the state you know there is a the taxes is set by you know the the state and the city can add theirs and the county adds theirs and you know we're paying almost eight percent sales tax right now which seems to me nuts i came from California yeah and you know when i left there we paid six cents on the dollar and that was like one of the highest in the nation right i think it's seven here or seven point something yeah yeah ours is seven point seven five almost eight and it drives me crazy i'm thinking you know everybody is sitting here screaming about yeah we don't want a state income tax but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up and they don't do anything about it um-hum right do where are you at what state so i'm in Lubbock Texas yeah oh really yeah there's we're still we still one of few that don't have the uh state tax taxes that's true and i did pay state tax in in California but my goodness that that the what do you call it sales tax is just getting outrageous to pay yeah that's true know you don't sound like you're from Dallas where do you come do you come from originally Texas or yeah yeah i do i've lived in in the Dallas area here since i was like four so uh it's i don't know rural an urban area i guess whatever i don't know what i'm oh okay you just you just managed to escape the real Texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there yeah no no i've just lived here but yeah i don't know i i do i can think of all the uh the biblical things about it too where what did they say to uh i can't think of the scripture Render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's so that's right you know even uh i think even in the the story where they had to pay the taxes the disciples and uh Jesus said the money in the fish's mouth or in the fish's inside the fish yeah and uh i thought of those two things when i was i was holding for a long time yeah yeah oh were you really trying to find someone at home well you know um back then what they try to do you know the would always try to stump Jesus try to give him something that would contradict himself right and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course that's when he said well you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's you render unto God what is God's and uh right and you know of course there i don't think they really cared about the answer they just wanted to try and catch him in something right get in yeah but i you know i believe in paying taxes and i mean yeah like everybody else i try to you know take as many deductions as i can that right and honest you know i don't want to pay more than i have to and and i get outraged sometimes when i feel like they go up for useless reasons but i believe that they're necessary you know so i really do oh sure sure right um-hum right where do do uh do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work or yeah are no not really i i we've i spends a lot of time with our income tax though this especially this year and last year um i have been married for just a few years so i've had to really switch around from the EZ form to the um just a regular right all the deductions and all that schedule A well yeah and you know did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act it seemed like it made everything harder yeah it really did i i saw that too i didn't notice anything simplified about it except that they took away the deductions for the interest and other things right right that's we're looking at buying a house and that's one of the main uh pluses we have about buying a house is yeah and it will help tremendously we bought ours five years ago and it's the one thing it seems like you make those payments every month and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles yeah um-hum right so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back yeah yeah you know there's a thing i just i've been trying to learn as much as i can about it if if you pay i i know i get paid twice a month every two weeks instead of twice a month so i get twenty six paychecks which would come out to be in like thirteen months uh-huh uh-huh that's right so if you pay your uh rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month you'll come out paying a uh-huh uh one month extra every year and it'll if have you a thirty year note it will take like seven or plus years off of your note that's right that's right my parents uh bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago and they did that they thought their payment is automatically taken out like every other Wednesday and that's exactly right even though the note is thirty years she said it's going be paid off in like twenty or twenty one years or something like that oh yeah um-hum right yeah uh just because uh exactly what you said you're making one more months payment every year right right and that's going on the principle it doesn't pay any interest or usually usually it doesn't anyway yeah so that's that's a good way to do it and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner yeah um-hum um-hum right that's what we're looking at fifteen or maybe twenty we're not going to go longer than twenty yeah yeah but we're taking our time we're going uh try to make our decision by July well that's good though so and we just started two or three weeks ago and we're not going to just kill ourselves you know just two or three houses a week at the most yeah and well that's good though is it kind of a buyers market down there you'll be yeah uh yeah absolutely and the credit union has nine percent interest so yeah so that's well that's good that's pretty excellent i don't know we couldn't think of a better time to buy than now that's good but anyway well um i can't think of a whole lot more to say well i can't either i appreciate the call though yeah me too and uh yeah same here my wife uh she went to uh the school out there in Lubbock um she was there for two or three years before we got married i enjoyed talking to you in Lubbock i guess before i even met her but Breyiana Breyiana look at me please just a second be quite please i can not hear i will talk to you in just a second go ahead so she went to school out here okay but anyway i just yeah she went to school there at uh Cathy Walker what was her name no i didn't know any Walker's no yeah but she well good luck in your house hunting yeah thanks a lot you y'all work at TI you you do okay oh really wow that's interesting i work in the wafer in the wafer fabrication in i do yeah i'm in human resources yeah do you really see that okay i worked with uh with Elma oh really yeah yeah and uh i used to work i i did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years oh wow and then i've just been in Human Resources the last two years and i work with those same people that i worked with all those nine years so i feel kind of part of the staff yeah yeah i'm i'm uh turning in a capital request right now yeah that's funny that's that's where you're from uh a machine that puts you are what are you trying to get back grind tape on and off the wafers oh okay so you work in back grind yeah i'm i'm sort of an acting process engineer but not officially but that's pretty much what i do yeah oh okay that's what you do huh and Demos four right and do most for well good deal what do y'all think of Sam oh i like him he's um he's hard but i we i think we needed that well that's good and he's i mean he he was very good for Lubbock when he came to he did you know it was the same kind of thing he he he had a lot of good results um-hum yeah that's that's what he said here he's gotten us into a linear flow that we've never been in before good well good and that's that's been a real big plus he's broadened our um the devices that we're making too good oh okay which has made us as lot more stable but anyway well it was nice to talk to you they're are going to interrupt us any minute now i can tell well that's good well you too and well i know they will and besides that my daughter wants me to put her to bed so well have a good day bye-bye okay yeah me too you well you too bye first and foremost my immediate fix for the federal budget would be a two percent straight across the board cut in federal spending in all departments now dealing on the federal level yes two percent two percent is a good choice but to as far as to increase tax revenues coming in you need to a redesigning of the entire tax structure itself corporate America is getting away with bloody murder where as the people out here are having to pay such a high amount of their actual bring home salaries into taxes the corporations are getting off easy because they're actually paying in less than five percent of their gross national product or their or their gross national product or profit okay profit rather i'm not knowledgeable in that area so i can only agree with what you're saying if they made it straight across the board everybody pay five percent if their gross national profit was say a million dollars then pay five five percent of that um-hum seems fair to me also individual level but the um overall it just seem like they've modified the tax laws so bad just the last five years the rich is it's definitely case that the rich are getting richer and the working people middle class and you know the lower middle class and the upper middle class are having to carry the entire burden um-hum well i am awfully bored with uh every every tax change uh supposedly having all these built in benefits for the poor because i think we have such a mismanagement of the funds that are designated for the poor so much graft and so much misspending that that money doesn't necessarily go where it's supposed to go uh i know you don't ever cutout greed and corruption but i think the management of the welfare dollar needs to come back to to the local levels because the local people know exactly who needs that money and who doesn't need that money when it's directed from afar i think the chance for misspending is greater i i suppose i'm thinking more in terms i i'm not thinking in terms of increasing taxes i'm just thinking for a quick fix uh a cut in federal spending is i guess my solution as long as you got congressmen and senators that are getting kickbacks kickbacks from these different companies that are getting awarded for the defense contracts that's never going to happen i know that's well maybe that's what i'm saying as long as greed and corruption is in there how do we get away from that though the one thing that i had thought about to help correct that problem you've got career politicians that spend thirty forty years in Washington that's all they have ever done right after they've been there that long they're so deep rooted with their the old boy network um-hum i think by limiting the number of consecutive terms a congressman or senator can hold whether it be a state congressman or senator or at the national level limiting the two terms and then they've got to sit out one um-hum i think that's wonderful when do we first when do we then start giving them their lifetime income as a retired politician i don't think we should ever give them a lifetime income but we do don't we unfortunately yes i know many people have said well if you throw everyone out and start over but then you uh the the amount of them who would be on lifetime income is so stupendous there's they have locked their benefits in to the point that once they've served two terms they're on gravy train anyway yes i think you're right i don't think we should ever give them a lifetime thing and they're the ones that have screamed so much much much about that don't want to increase taxes and they don't want to do this but every year they vote themselves in a very healthy pay raise it they don't they speak with fork and tongue don't they at least we're in agreement on that aren't we i'm afraid i have no other thoughts on fixes and i'm not really sure that they would accept our suggestions anyhow i think eventually it's going get to the point where there's going to be a majority of the American people that have had enough of what it's finally come to we're you getting so far down to where you're being taxed so far down where you can't even afford to change your mind um-hum it's going to come to a point where the average American citizens say we've had enough how do they react then we're prosecuted if we simply don't pay our taxes so i'm not real sure how you believe then that eventually there'll be an overthrow we know communism doesn't work what do we do next well in the form of capitalism that we've got apparently that's not working real good either uh i heard uh someone uh supposedly an authority saying speaking on TV saying that the interest rate as we have known it in the past will never be the that high again and he was speaking in senior citizens living on their incomes of from interest CD interest and that sort of interest i think the voting block of senior citizens is a tremendous voting block too but every voting block is slapped and toward their own special interest and i think that makes it doubly difficult to make a change i guess i'm saying we're all selfish maybe not a case of everybody being selfish every man carry their own fair burden but not somebody else's yes that's true it doesn't seem to workout that way though does it i think that the lobbyist uh are so protecting what they have in the budget that it doesn't seem to work that every man has to pay his own fair share and maybe that's why corporate America gets away with what they're doing because of the kickbacks and et cetera i'm a bit of a a pessimist i don't see a change in my lifetime i'm afraid you're younger perhaps you can foresee one i never put anything beyond as far as when it'll happen that i'm not real sure of if it will happen i have no doubt um-hum um-hum yes i think you're right i'm just saying that i don't think the American people are at this point rebellious enough that it will happen in my lifetime yes i think eventually the system will change i still think we have the best system uh with the elected officials i i'm not sure that uh it's working right now though it is the best system that's out there right now but it does need some fine tuning at this point absolutely nice talking to you okay nice talking to you bye bye well i um i haven't really lived in a lot of big cities i mean i'm living in Dallas now Plano is outside of Dallas but um so i don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution huh-uh but i know when i lived down in Houston on the outskirts of Houston there were some towns like Pasadena that had oil refineries huh-uh and um if you would drive by there like on your way to the beach or something huh-uh there would just be dumping this huge amounts of smoke into the air and it always smelled really bad we know that that was huh-uh really really really bad for the atmosphere what have you got up there well i i live out in the country so that part is good uh we're maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh which has a lot of pollution from their plants uh-huh and right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator oh no and uh it won't be too far from where we live and everybody really has been you know fighting against it because we just we do not want it well we don't want one any place sure we would like the uh industry to do more to take care of the uh waste products before they turn to incineration because we feel that uh the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much you know the uh yeah and it's just i mean it's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air and and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there and everywhere it all adds up huh-uh huh-uh and plus all the problems in uh the Middle East with all that smoke and oh that has to be terrible over there yeah so it's just um why are we doing this to ourselves i just don't know but um i you know what really amazes me about like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries huh-uh huh-uh is that there would be houses and people living just really close to it i mean between the freeway and the oil refinery you would see a neighborhood and yeah huh-uh you just thought well it's obvious that there's a lot going up in the air there and what comes up must come down yeah yeah breathing it we're breathing it all the time and we yes and and how if they have all of those um toxicity i mean it there's signs around saying how dangerous it is and then here you are living close to next to it just doesn't make too much sense um-hum um-hum no and i figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste no matter who does it So huh-uh and they have shown some of the industries have been real good at uh uh doing their part in uh reducing the amount that they have huh-uh uh they've reused some of it uh it can be recycled a lot of their things huh-uh and that they've shown that it uh to begin with apparently it does cost more um-hum but once they get started it's really it saves them money in the end and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way um-hum and if they would all that's what that's what we want done is we want industry to take you know more responsibility in taking care of it well um individual companies and things are so selfish and their desires to save a few dollars and and that they don't care about the environmental impact that they make huh-uh huh-uh they're greedy it's money is what is it's it's the money uh-huh yes they're making fantastic amounts on these things and uh even the incinerator the money and the income that they're going to make off this is you know just astronomical um-hum well have you ever visited um like Los Angeles or any place that's ever it's kind of known that it has uh pollution in it's air we've never been we went as far as as uh like Las Vegas and Yellow Stone Park we did go we should have gone the whole way over but we didn't um-hum uh-huh but i understand that we have an aunt that lives out there and when she was visiting here she would look up at the stars and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw well it's uh-huh um-hum she said they couldn't see those things out there um-hum because of the smog and everything that's so awful well what about in New York i guess you've gone that way maybe no never been in New York i don't want to go there yeah pretty funny have you been there well i've been to New York i have um relatives that direction i have it's um where are you close is it close to Phoenixville Pennsylvania oh um no i never heard of that one because i have family there and we're near Pittsburgh Clarion University oh huh-uh it's pretty neat it's it's kind of northwest part of Pennsylvania that's beautiful country up that way i know it's um very lush and pretty up in the back in the east it's really huh-uh you sound very young are you a young person well i'm thirty one thirty one you're young seems kind of old to me no you're young you have a lot of life yet and these we have some people who say well this isn't going to affect me this air pollution huh-uh uh older people or they think they're far enough away from something um-hum that it's and they don't realize these things are going to affect everybody and if you're older it's not going to affect you that way you have grandchildren you have children uh nieces nephews whatever friends yes uh everybody is going to be affected by it that's really true and we all you know need to be willing to help pay a little bit like i've heard some people uh grumble about their uh cars passing their emission tests and things and huh-uh how they've had to how it's more expensive and things and i thought well it's so much better huh-uh they say it has really made a difference though uh-huh now see we don't have that here yet oh you don't no we don't have that testing in that down here yet hum but they i have read that that that it has really helped where the problem is greater where the population is greater uh-huh and that it has made a difference well i really think it must i think every i mean well think about how many automobiles there are um-hum um-hum and each is putting out like we have a car an older one of our cars is an older car and every time you start it from the tail pipe it makes a black spot on the cement um-hum um-hum um-hum and you know that that is a sign something's coming out yeah yeah and that's all cars are doing that and it's really polluting the air yeah yeah if you have to put a price on it which is more valuable life or paying a little more huh-uh and it's also it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer and things um-hum we sure wouldn't want um-hum so much more people suffering from that yeah and like i said i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it because it's industry we're paying industry to make the products and we're helping pay for there making these end products that are toxic waste then we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace huh-uh huh-uh then they put it in the dump some place and they find out well this dump doesn't work so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else We end up paying for it again now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators and we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted huh-uh pretty sad or the where they want to put the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the Clarion the two water sheds that feed Clarion river oh no and you know it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there because huh-uh if that water gets contaminated it will go on down to Pittsburgh it will you know it affects so many people um-hum and it's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this no no it's scary it's scary huh-uh it really is it's really awful well i've really enjoyed the conversation it's helped me to think more about some issues that i need to be thinking more about it is really a concern huh-uh its a and it's instead of waiting until it directly affects me like you say it's important to be involved ahead of time well you have a good day huh-uh um-hum well you too thank you huh-uh bye bye-bye okay okay they suggested that we uh discuss what we think of when we say camping yeah what do you where do you like to camp how do you like to camp oh i can camp just about most anyway camping or uh motor home is nice uh travel trailer pop up i used to uh live in the Ozarks and uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods oh really oh you really rough it then yeah uh-huh do you do that very often i haven't done it in quite awhile since i moved down here But i used to do it uh-huh uh-huh quite a bit you'd have a lot of hills in that down in that area yeah yeah it was real hilly yeah that would be really great take a twenty two and go out pardon take a twenty two and find a creek uh-huh that sounds like it'd be fun did you go alone or with a group or i used to go with my brother we just lived up there uh-huh uh-huh oh that's great long as it's not raining yeah it gets kind of i we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in um-hum get out of the rain really oh that would but i don't know much about camping in Texas uh-huh well i'm in Pennsylvania you're in Pennsylvania yes i didn't know they did this are you in Texas now yeah oh okay yeah i'm down here at TI most everybody i've been talking to is from Texas but uh we're up here in western northwestern part of Pennsylvania i used to be in Ohio it's some pretty country up there uh-huh well you kind of know what it's like then so yeah but we've uh we've done uh many types of camping we've we've done tent camping and we had access to a motor home which is really super great if you don't want to rough it too much yeah you can get the and uh they have some nice camping grounds you know that have the water piped out uh-huh uh-huh just set it up and get out of get out of the city for awhile right just get you away from the everyday things that are going on we when the children were smaller we used to go to uh Delaware along the ocean ocean most every year and that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks and uh we really enjoyed that tell you what i'm losing you huh i said i'm losing you you're getting fade you're fading out oh maybe my dropping my phone is that better yeah that's oh but so what you try take a vacation every year and go out and camp yeah well we used to we don't as much anymore but uh we used to we kind of slowed down a little bit but uh i think the worst the worst thing is when it's raining if you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping yeah then it can be kind of bad i know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks uh-huh that's kind of kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping i don't think i would like that what kind uh Copperheads mostly oh those aren't too pleasant no they're yeah we have some of them around here you probably have more there though i would imagine yeah one year they were they were just everywhere i don't know what it was we had a real rainy spring and then it was all year there was oh uh-huh just Copperheads everywhere uh-huh but you still backpacked and camped out yeah well i lived down in down in the bottom of a big hollow and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time uh-huh if it rained we were stuck back in there had a four wheel drive so we could uh-huh uh-huh you just get used to it yeah i guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting or whatever you're doing yeah yeah yeah i would think i would think a cave would be could have problems like that too yeah this cave that we used to go in was little it was small it was more uh-huh yeah it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out uh-huh is your brother younger than you or yeah he's about a year and a half younger uh-huh uh-huh well that's great that'd be a lot of fun you have a lot good experiences from that yeah yeah yeah it was saw a few bears did you really things like that what black ones yeah yeah that would be exciting yeah the first first couple of times it's pretty scary but uh after that you realize they are just as afraid of you too so yeah yeah they're usually more afraid of you than uh you are of them usually but they're on the increase in this area oh really um-hum i don't know if they don't have them up there do they the black bear oh yeah yeah the population's been really really up they've uh yeah oh do they they've had longer hunting seasons than that up here even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much yeah they down here they they stopped for awhile or they really made it hard to hunt them i don't know what it's like now i haven't been back up there in awhile uh-huh yeah but uh we we really like camping i i must say that uh we have we really have a lot of fun a lot of memories in that from camping and uh well it's good to get out and smell some fresh air too yeah yeah so it's just so it's a lot of work too it's uh getting you know getting ready and taking care of everything but it's um yeah it's really refreshing so well i think we're about to run out of our time i think so well it was really good hearing from you and i hope you get back into camping again and do a little more of it yeah yeah i'm sure i will okay thanks a lot and you have a good day okay bye-bye you too bye uh tell you what um i'll let you start or if that's all right okay um my major source of information i guess is TV news excuse me i uh wake up to it in the morning this is my i guess my prime time for news first thing in the morning while i'm getting ready to go to work oh i quite frequently uh glance through headlines or in the newspaper but uh primarily mine is uh TV news how about yourself pretty interesting yeah i have to have to agree with you um normally don't have time in the morning to to watch the any type of TV usually catch it going to work on the radio or when i drag the paper in from the front and it pops out of the bag i usually catch the headlines which is normally what you see the night before on the evening news yeah so uh i've kind of um um true uh we have a one year old in the house so it's kind of hard sometimes to watch TV during the during the during the night but i usually try to catch the ten o'clock or um um those type of issues i'd to say during the war uh there were we were the American public was probably flooded with um uh-huh uh too much information and as far as the sub question about was i satisfied am i satisfied with the coverage i'd have to say yes but when it came to the war issues it was like who's telling the truth you could between the channels there was uh the casualties were differently the amount of missiles launched were different and it was almost too much information over-communicated well that's true but uh i uh my personal opinion is that the uh the various network news medias were uh trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military true i agree with you now i can appreciate that especially after what happened in Vietnam yeah which is a is a joke uh but i mean let's face it today's today's uh means of communications we could uh very well a newscaster could very well give away away a piece of top secret information um-hum and uh pat himself on the back for for uh making a big scoop yeah that's a good point uh but i would have to say across the board i'm i'm satisfied with the way uh the news is is spread um of course here at Texas Instruments uh the rumor mill runs rampant the secretary's probably are the best resource of what the layoff status is very true i find T News very enlightening and i check that everyday and of course with that goes along the the stock price of TI yes yeah yeah yeah yeah i agree with you i i'm glad you mentioned that because i think i have to since i don't have the opportunity in the morning i'll probably catch the the head lines on T News that's a good point of course T News is is more or less headlines uh i don't think much of of their sports coverage um-hum yeah true kind of short all they give the scores yeah least but uh that's right i'm not yeah outside of of uh pro football i'm not too interested in other games uh other sports anyway um-hum but uh the the T News is is a good way to keep up to date i think they do a pretty good job selecting the most important items well that's great yeah i do i surely do they do they surely do uh anything anything else cross your mind uh i guess most of us go by the audio which is the the television television or the radio uh-huh um yeah but you need to continue to read so you you can people learn to read you know well i spent twenty years in professional in uh commercial broadcasting ten in radio and then ten in uh TV and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits and of bits and pieces of news on the air hm uh i mean there there are times where uh video uh reporter actually will risk is life life and limb i've seen it happen time and time again and uh well i remember one time up in Nashville Tennessee was one of the fellows fellows got mixed up in a with a riot going on down there but he was lucky he got out of it hm for some reason because he was carrying a camera uh they left him alone ouch everybody got excited um-hum that's tough that's tough well i've enjoyed speaking with you nice talking to you too Jim did you get your catalog on your your your gifts no oh yeah i just got mine in the mail so it kind of inspires me to keep calling oh well i'll have to be looking for it then yeah they're not to shabby they're pretty good is that right well good yes sir have a great day bye-bye you too alrighty ladies first oh no well i don't find a lot of time to watch TV and a lot of the time i find it during the day when i'm rocking my little girl to sleep so i watch a lot of reruns old shows hm like Dick Van Dyke and all those old crazy shows Barney Fife i guess yeah yeah i really enjoy watching Andy Griffith well something well so are you a homemaker i guess that's the the right term nowadays yeah yeah i guess so yeah i am i stay home with two kids and yeah well my wife we have a new one in the house and she's she's stays home too also huh um i guess i have a wide variety i like watching the TV for things that are interesting not so much the the boring the uh the things that aren't for example like the Cosby Show to me is just kind of like a waste of my time and and Different Strokes and but i like Sixty Minutes Prime Time Live um course i have to watch cartoons on Saturday morning but not the Ninja Turtle ones i like the old-timey ones Tom and Jerry uh-huh yeah you sound like my husband he really likes Tom and Jerry and uh Bugs Bunny and all his friends and all those guys there you go that's right Johnny Quest you know the good ones um now i'll if i'm ever home during the during the day on a vacation day i'd i have to catch at twelve o'clock the Andy Griffith Show because he's just you know he's one of my idles and then uh yeah yeah yeah but i don't know it just seems like that nowadays everything's so electronic you know and magnified and and animated that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings and and so uh um-hum um-hum um-hum uh now i do with the Cosby Show i have seen it a couple of times and and i do i i like the show i just don't watch it because of the timing but uh some of the crap that's on TV nowadays and yeah yeah yeah it's bad i do watch the special shows that they come out with the the Nova stuff and and the nature shows yeah yeah but um i think there's enough out there to pick from i'm not we don't have cable to the point of of of the HBO or any of that stuff and but uh yeah yeah well i find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children because with two kids and you know i don't want them watching something that i don't think they should watch i i used to be really hooked on All My Children and i watched that for like um-hum sure oh me oh ten or fifteen straight years oh no and then i had well you know i'd eat like at lunch at work we'd have a TV or whatever and then um as my kids got older and started you know recognizing what was going on and i thought this isn't really very good ouch fifteen years bet they hated that so i gave it up yeah i had watched it i had watched it since it started so it was kind of but now i'd you know i didn't know who the characters are and um i'll turn it on every once in awhile don't recognize anybody so i guess that's a good sign oh goodness yeah really i'll watch oh i i used to watch uh i can recall though this might age me uh date me here i can remember staying home when i was five and six and my mother watching The Edge of Night uh-huh oh yeah well see you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched The Secret Storm and The Edge of Night um-hum uh-huh uh-huh Secret Storm though i think they were back to back on black and white okay i mean i'm just a youngster and i was like oh my gosh yeah yeah we used to my mother watched all that stuff too and As As the World Turns i think As the World Turns may still i don't know if it's still on or not it was still not too long ago well you know still be on yeah yeah now they got a lot other crap involved and so i don't know you're right i think some of the tones uh of the the the daily prime time is is questionable that could be uh yeah yeah yeah i have to agree with you you know keep them on that channel eleven channel twenty one the nature stuff you know yeah right yeah yeah we do and it's real interesting too the difference in my kids like um my oldest loved Sesame Street and um-hum those kinds of shows my my younger one doesn't she's more into Walt Disney kind you know we watch a lot of movies that we've got on VCR you know on tapes and stuff she's more into the animated stuff where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing so um-hum um-hum hm uh yeah well but uh we do a lot of kid watching well sound like you got your hand fulls there and i do appreciate speaking with you sure it was fun have you gotten your catalog yet no i don't think so yeah i just spoke to the gentleman i just got mine the mail and i inspired me to make more phone calls oh well see i haven't really i've had a few people call me but i've never made one so yeah i need to get brave oh really check out your pen number yeah yeah that's what i need to do have a good day bye-bye thanks good bye what kind of fishing do you enjoy well uh normally i like to to go out fishing in a boat and uh rather than like bank fishing and just like you try and catch anything that's swimming because i've had such problems of trying to catch any type of fish that uh i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing so you like fresh water uh-huh uh-huh i've never tried like with deep uh sea water fishing uh-huh because you get i get sea sick but one of these days i'm going hoping they'll have some kind of medicine so i can go out and go uh deep sea fishing now that would be nice oh i see well i was raised on the Texas Gulf Coast in the summers and during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast have you uh um-hum and so i thought fish came out of the ocean oh my goodness and anything that was fresh water was muddy uh-huh so i didn't learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties wow so i had i had always been a a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun um-hum um-hum oh i bet it is there's so many different ways to catch fish you know at night you can um-hum go walking in the shallows and gig flounder and things like that which isn't technically fishing but it's a lot of fun uh-huh so i i grew up fishing uh-huh what area lakes do you like well uh now i haven't done much fishing here in Texas uh because i moved from Ohio oh i see uh but uh we did a lot of fishing when we were up there but down here i have a brother that likes to go over on the east in East Texas and do fishing and i can't remember what the name of the lake is and he was just here this past weekend i could have i i think he mentioned it again but i couldn't remember what it was um i want to call it Salt Fork or Lake Fork i i can't remember but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places oh oh oh uh i think i know where uh Lake Caddo or something like that i you know that may be it that may be it and it if it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places they hold tournaments there and everything yeah yeah yeah and he said that he has never gone anywhere before and he's fished all over the United States in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen so i would love to go over there they were talking about going over there and some time this spring and i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing and uh and catch some bass i would love to do that but they have snakes over there and i'm not too welcome around i don't i really don't want to share a boat with a snake uh-huh uh-huh i just i i i don't see it yeah i just i don't i think that i perhaps would let them have the boat or something i'd make some quick arrangements that's true and i've heard so many stories about the snakes uh-huh you know when they pull in there's a snake instead of a fish and things like that that i'm just yeah oh i don't know what's the largest fish you ever caught yeah um gosh i think it was only like three and a half pounds and for me that's big that's why i'm saying i love to go fishing because i've never caught anything really really big um so because it's always been you know in the on a lake and uh i know they have bigger fish than that but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me on a lake yeah on a lake on a lake that's not a bad size fish yeah no that's a good size fish i i would be impressed i mean you know yeah yeah so uh but yeah i'd love to go catch catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing i've never done that uh-huh i've i've seen it uh and and i have no problem going out in a boat uh it's just so dreadfully expensive and there's just so many other ways you know when you live down there yeah it's not a treat um-hum it's what you do every day you know that's right that's right uh one of my favorite things was we were forever catching crab and steaming them yeah you know out on the on the beach uh-huh and you know just uh pitching them out on uh on uh what am i trying to say newspaper um-hum and and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and and that's it wow uh-huh yeah and uh the the other little creatures would take care of what was left that's right that's right so going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do right right well do you live like along uh Houston no down there no no i live in Dallas well i meant when when you were when you were growing up i mean like Galveston i lived in Dallas oh okay but you uh we had a house in Port Aransas oh okay okay it's a little fishing village that is that's close to uh South Padre oh Corpus okay corpus well uh South Padre is on down the bend okay okay it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down it would be in that region um-hum um-hum small island yeah yeah i i've been to Port Aransas but it was when i was a child uh oh okay yes because i have relatives who live in Houston so when would go and we would go to Port Aransas or then on down to Corpus or further yeah like what your talking about because i was just wondering we went to Galveston this this summer even with all the oil spills and everything i mean i was was it bad oh it was horrible i well never ever go back i don't think uh and yeah and that that's true um oh i hate to hear that uh you know the the water was murky and i would hate to think about catching fish or anything there huh-uh huh-uh no i wouldn't want to eat them you know so yeah no no no you went to Galveston uh i have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water um-hum the uh what is it the Flagship yes uh-huh is it still there it sure is yeah yeah it most certainly is so uh so that it it was it was certain things that were enjoyable about it but uh i don't i think it's lost a lot of it's appeal i like that place that then because of all the oil spills that they have had and uh it always smelled the entire time we were there it was i didn't realize that had happened for some reason yeah we went swimming one time in the whole week that we were there and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool because the water was so awful and well of course being raised on the water i'd never swim in it yeah yeah huh-uh swimming is for swimming yeah pool that's why they call them swimming pools uh-huh uh-huh that's where you swim you do not swim in the ocean no no not anymore no i've seen what comes out of the ocean and i have no desire to share any space with anything like that but really huge sharks are down there i mean uh-huh incredibly large sharks uh-huh uh some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night um-hum it was incredible the size of them that we would see on the the next morning they would have them strung up across the wow uh-huh and it you know so if strung up their tails would still hang on the bottom of the uh just wow wow yeah now i never knew they were that that big huh kind of kind of nothing i won't have anything to do with yeah yeah right well it was nice talking to you well it certainly was um maybe you can get how many have you had very many of these calls um yeah almost everyday how wonderful yeah almost almost every single day from when they started it how wonderful yeah maybe i'll be so lucky okay i enjoyed talking to you okay bye-bye bye-bye camping uh is a pretty vague term it seems to encounter or cover a lot of different kinds of of uh shall we say over night trips or sometimes not even over night uh anything from no provisions to uh going with what you can carry on a backpack uh maybe even a tent um-hum go up to state parks with six shelters and little screened in areas and then travel trailers and all the way up to conference center type campings that have uh you know air conditioning like hotels with uh uh ski boats and whatever else may be around some people uh they they still call that a camp so i guess you could go camping and do archery and riflery and all the things that kids do at those camps but then go to their little hotel air conditioning room at night right um-hum so uh i've been through most all of that i've not done much of the no provision survival type but i've done backpacking in tents and state park shelters and travel trailers and uh camping camping with nice air conditioned rooms and i guess of all the all the ones i kind of prefer the air conditioned ones and the the not so roughing ones with more entertainment than uh survival in mind huh uh one of the times that we were at a uh state park we went up into Oklahoma and went to a place called Broken Bow and rented a few canoes with a church group we were with bunch of college age kids and we took these canoes into a river that would feed it that would bring us back down toward drove up upstream and then worked our way back down toward the campsite that we were at um-hum and you just never can time those things right with the water the way you would like them to be uh we got there and the water was really low we we ended up carrying the canoes over portions and at one point even though i know your not supposed to do this i stood up in the canoe and reached my paddle up as high as i could and i could not even touch the branches that were over the the uh river part there and you could see debris in those branches where the water had just been a couple of weeks prior um-hum huh so it was you know ten or so feet uh higher just a few weeks ago in fact uh a few weeks prior to when we got there and the camp the people at the campgrounds told us that uh asked where we were from and we said Dallas and they said oh well we had a girl die just two weeks ago in that rage of water huh well that's encouraging but they said oh you have nothing to worry about you'll have the opposite problem you may die of carrying your canoe and sure enough it uh it was a little bit laborious instead of a a six to eight hours worth of canoeing we ended up only surviving about uh half the trip and it took us us about ten hours so we we got in our car half way and and went and got the rest of the vehicles and brought them up stream and loaded it all back up and went back to the campsite exhausted but uh i have had better camping canoeing trips uh as it were uh like the Guadalupe down in South Texas it's got some real nice uh um-hum canoeing uh water in it have you been camping much um-hum i mostly do uh back packing uh as opposed to any of the other sorts um-hum um though i guess a bread and breakfast or something might be a suggestion for you if you like the air condition type that's true uh-huh the uh yeah i've done things uh i guess mostly upstate Michigan the Adirondacks White Mountains um Appalachian Trail kinds of things uh i prefer going out either with one other person or by myself for about a week and i guess i just look at it as i time i can get away from it all and hum kind of rely on my own resources a bit although i guess i haven't gone survival camping where i scrape together all my food i've always carried it with me but uh um-hum still it's you know nice to get away from civilization every once in a while and yeah enjoy the wildlife i wonder if uh being from uh Dallas area i i wonder if if it's just this area that's doesn't encourage that type of camping i i seems like back packing goes well with mountain and sceneries sceneries worth seeing by foot where as here your looking as you know you can go two hundred miles and your probably in the same kind of environment you were in when you left so um-hum huh uh unless you go over toward East Texas where there's a considerable considerable amount of woods or if you go uh extreme south part where there's some some things worth seeing by foot uh the majority of of camping experiences around here seem to be geared toward entertainment where you're you're looking at the state parks all seem to have something of a um-hum a either a lake that you'd go canoeing or skiing or whatever kind of sailing boating you want to do uh um-hum but there's not a whole lot of trails built in a lot of state parks there are in more of the the eastern part of the state where there's woods worth worth seeing but uh that's interesting i hadn't um-hum all the people that i know that do back packing usually go up to Colorado or go up somewhere and you know get away from the state to actually do that kind of uh camping um-hum yeah i end up well yeah i mean i do a lot of like even weekender kind of things i go out for just one or two nights uh it's not my favorite thing but i can do it a lot more often so like over at the uh particularly in the uh the fall and spring when the insects haven't come out yet uh where they're already gone uh you know i spend almost every weekend up in the mountains and i guess i live about five hours away from some place to go hiking where i am now that's not too bad um pardon me that's not too bad at all no no it's not bad and uh yeah i mean if it's if you can find somebody who's uh you know willing to go out for several days you know and can handle that sort of thing uh which isn't everybody you run across obviously who's willing to um-hum you know put seventy or ninety pounds on their back and go hiking uh but uh it can be a lot of fun yeah and uh i there's certainly other people who go out uh canoeing i mean there's usually lots and lots of ponds particularly uh for canoeing and you know there are places you can drive in and park and they've got the usual kinds of campgrounds and stuff but uh you can also just you know bushwack or go on semi trailed areas and just get three days from any place that's civilization huh and that's kind of fun yeah that would be one of my very first experiences of uh tent camping if it were with a group of people we went up to a state park that was um-hum oh the campsites were uh not perfect but they were you know basic rail road ties and laid in sand so it wasn't just the actual terrain and it had a somewhat level and it had a place to stick your tent and some um-hum um-hum you could uh drive a stake in fairly easy and and get the thing nailed down but that's usually a little windy on a lake edge and uh the very first time we went up there with this group of people we all set up these tents most of which were borrowed and we were having to figure out you know how this particular one works and how this one works and it's eleven o'clock at night and it's you know by the head lights of the cars and um-hum and about uh oh a little after midnight we got all these tents set up and i laid down inside one of them and was just about asleep when a little voice from outside the tent said uh asked if i was doing all right and i said huh yeah yeah doing doing just fine you know it's a little windy but i'm doing all right and and they suggested that i come out that mine was the only tent that hadn't fallen down yet and sure enough after i got out of there a little bit it blew down and the winds were just terrible and uh then it started to rain so we didn't get too wet but uh it rained just for a little bit then went on and so after all that was over we put them all back up and woke up a little late the next morning but uh when we finally got back from that that outing one of the uh parents of one of the kids had asked how it went and said that he was listening to the the radio and they clocked a ninety sev en mile an hour winds on the dam right in front of that lake and there's really nothing to stop it it's uh thirty or forty miles wide it's a huge uh oh boy lake right on the border of Texas and Oklahoma there and and it had a the little little part that we were on was the peninsula with no trees so we were just stuck out in the water with uh nothing blocking us from this wind it's a wonder we didn't lose a lot more than that but uh i'm sure that was just huh um-hum the top speed of the wind but it it did manage to take all our tents out yeah it's funny when you talk about you know this it sort of reminds me that every time i'm telling somebody about like a camping trip and i've i've done quite a few say with my sister is the stuff that you remember isn't you know really so much the uh the normal everyday you know oh this is a nice scene or something like this it's it's remember when are we had to put up the tent on the side of the hill and we kept sliding down to the bottom of the tent or you know when the tent's blowing down or when you wake up in the middle of the night and there's a hurricane and you know it's yeah yeah we can laugh about it i mean your not laughing about it then too much i mean you know afterwards it's it's it's kind of a nice memory to think gee i survived that we'll always need the uh feather bed as it were yeah that's for sure yep that's true on that same lake there's another portion of it that's uh real uh carved out the the the shoreline shoreline is uh up against rock and it's it's pretty far cliff i'd say shirt or forty feet worth and the campsites are up top and then you go down and there's a little path where the little rail road ties again will try to stop the erosion on the path and little stair steps all the way down to this beach um-hum and that was uh a that particular campout okay i guess that's it uh yep i was just thinking about what movies i've seen lately mostly uh we go to uh the second or third run movies i guess what the ones that we call the dollar used to call the dollar movies yeah uh so we see uh the ones that have been out for a while i was trying to think what the last movie that we went to see was probably Russia House with uh Sean Connery and uh yeah yeah sure found it quite enjoyable myself uh uh had also seen the Hunt For Red October you know with him in that and um-hum God i don't have to say kind of caught me off i'm more of a looks good in the paper commercials look great on TV um um-hum uh i did see Red October yeah uh this is going to be i've seen a lot of video lot of lot of video VCR stuff um yeah man oh man i have to say uh Chevy Chase uh Christmas you know the Vacation Christmas yeah thing was one here recently we saw at Christmas time um God i haven't been in a movie since maybe Superman Batman maybe Batman might have been one yeah well that's yeah yeah well well i didn't even see Batman so that's uh that's pretty good so it's been or no let's see uh Dick Tracy i did we did see Dick Tracy so that's i haven't seen any of that stuff really yeah so uh so you so then you're not a uh uh not a frequent movie goer either well i love it we uh got a new baby in the house and and and she just turned a year old so it just kind of put the clamp on things um oh yeah yeah so so you watch a lot of videos yeah then uh stop by and get them at you know for ninety nine cents and bring them home but yeah that's right what uh what do you find uh that you're looking at most in those uh the i mean are they are they the comedies and uh that kind of stuff comedies and the PG's and the no skin uh um-hum we're uh know like we saw Sally and uh well Billy Crystals in it we saw that one and which was video that's that's probably the last movie i went to see yeah that's probably the last one yeah yeah uh-huh yeah we we saw that one uh we find that uh that uh if you can get into those dollar movies you know they're uh they're a dollar and a half what is it dollar and a quarter dollar and a half now quarter Promenade yeah and uh at the Promenade yeah and uh you know we we find those pretty good they're not uh it's not so far you know from when they were first run that you don't enjoy them sure occasionally you'll find one that's you know some of the friends will be talking about them that you wished that you'd seen them so you could talk about them sooner but uh i mean fifteen bucks to go see a movie with two with a couple's a little ridiculous yeah that's that's a little bit too much so yeah and some of them that turned to flops we saw other other other night we saw um Lady in Red but um-hum okay which is not that old but you know it was bounced around the VCR cabinet there and um yeah yeah but yeah we i used to really you know i'd just pick up the paper and we'd go see a couple you know three or four movies a month but no we haven't i haven't been to a movie in it's been four or five months uh-huh yeah but uh yeah we we find even uh you know even looking at the dollar movies which are you'd think those are the ones that uh are coming back around because they were good the first time um-hum and we don't find a lot of those uh you know they'll be running uh four to six of those on a weekend um-hum and you know two weekends three weekends out of four maybe two or three two out of three or three out of four there won't be anything that we want to go see um-hum and uh so then when something comes up they'll usually stay on a while so we we still get a chance to see you know one of them that we want to see but uh we saw Avalon and uh i think we went in to see Avalon because we couldn't get in to maybe we wanted to go see Ghost and couldn't get into Ghost because the line you know they sold out um-hum um-hum um-hum we went to see Avalon and uh i really was not that impressed with Avalon it uh really you know it's uh it's one of these uh more i don't know melodramatic and and i don't know uh not satirical wasn't funny at all but it was kind of drab i don't know had a had a lot of hidden meanings in it i suppose but uh you know ooh my it's got to be something fun yeah you don't have to think yeah sure yeah and uh right but uh i really enjoy uh the espionage type of movies the the uh um-hum The Hunt For Red October and Russia House i had read uh the Russia House book before so i i i thought it was a real good movie um is it a good movie great i enjoyed the book quite a bit too so that's that made it made it more interesting to me let's see uh a lot of it the dialogue was uh a little difficult to understand because uh Michelle Pfeiffer had a was speaking with her Russian accent you know the the actress Russian accent so um-hum it was part of that was a little hard to understand probably overcompensated a little bit right and uh so you if you knew what was going on you could kind of anticipate what was going to be said so i i had a little bit advantage there over my wife she had not read the book um-hum but uh and well i think the now it's all coming back to me what was the one not The Deep but The Abyss um yeah the last year i think yeah we didn't see that one i'm not uh i don't see don't go see too many in well i would but my wife doesn't like the the uh the science fiction semi horror type stuff you know um-hum things that uh get you on the edge of your seat a little too much for her yeah i'm not much of a Rotocop man Robocop you know myself yeah this one it wasn't heavy hi-sci you know hi-fi because it was a lot of it was actual stuff that takes place and they had of course the breathing apparatus which was liquid and and then all a sudden you know when you actually met this thing and and that that was you know towards like the last third of the movie only really got strange but it was uh um-hum you know it was cold in the theater and it's wet in the movie and they kind of just it was it was comfortable it was easy to go in you didn't have to think a lot and and uh and there is nothing worse than going to see a movie where you have to follow a hidden plot yeah and it and then you leave the movie like with your brain you got a headache trying to follow this damn movie right well it's it's bad enough that you know if you got a little back problem or something have to sit in those seats and wiggle and squirm around and usually come out with your back hurting anyway so yep specially those intermission movies yep right and course those those dollar dollar and quarter movies you might catch a spring too so yeah that's right got to be careful well anyway uh i guess if uh if you're don't have anything else to talk about i guess i we can hang up on this one they're great okay okay i appreciate it thanks uh-huh thank you sir bye okay all right there we go yep so what's what's your prediction on North Carolina and Duke well i don't know about North Carolina but well actually North Carolina i think North Carolina's gonna to do pretty good i think they'll go to the finals i mean my gosh uh look who Kansas beat to get to meet North Carolina i mean they they beat uh Arkansas i know Arkansas was good i can't believe and they beat and they beat Indiana they beat Indiana they creamed Indiana i can't yeah i can't believe they beat Arkansas i thought Arkansas would go all the way to the finals well i i thought so too they they just had a letdown in the second half and they couldn't recover yeah i don't know well UNLV they say UNLV may be the greatest amateur team ever they beat Duke's ass last year yeah big time i i'll bet they could hold their own in the NBA yeah think so really seriously i i bet there're some teams they could beat yeah like the Hornets anyone can beat the Hornets yeah possibly yeah actually i'm kind of a Lakers fan myself yeah me too i like uh oh the um Magic oh yeah him and Worthy and uh AC Green's pretty good yeah yeah he's good coming off the bench now of course the other they got Sam Perkins um-hum and that that helps i'm not much of a NBA NBA fan myself oh okay well you remember Sam Perkins when he was in North Carolina don't you oh no sure don't see he was a teammate with James Worthy and Michael Jordan uh-huh the the three of those guys were the three pillars of the national championship team North Carolina had back in eighty two i think when Jordan was just a freshman yeah didn't know that yeah in fact uh Jordan hit the winning basket to win by one point with like sixteen seconds to go huh they they gave him the ball he took the shot if he makes it he's a hero if he misses it he's a goat he made it huh well he made it yep hm hm so how about what do you think who do you think's gonna win the final well i really don't think anybody anybody can beat UNLV they they might beat themselves but i don't know they're at such a high level of intensity yeah i watched the they they would have to have a really off day and somebody else would have to have a really on day and if that if both of those happened at the same time you might have an upset yeah they can keep on the pressure all the whole game yep yep they're absolutely relentless pretty good well they're so close to an undefeated undefeated season they can taste it and they wanna make history so i don't think they're gonna lack for motivation yeah Duke'll be mighty mad though well i mean it's it's no disgrace to lose in the final four oh yeah well the disgrace they won't lose lose last year well UNLV's kind of in a different league from everybody else it it's kind of similar to back when UCLA was winning seven titles in a row from sixty seven to seventy three back then they they called the invitational um yeah with Kareem well with him yeah and with Bill Walton and they used to call it the uh the UCLA invitational because they figured everybody else is just coming to just to be there yeah been a while since they had the straight winner yeah i i don't know that any one team's gonna be able to dominate for that many years in a row huh uh partly because the really outstanding many of the really outstanding players leave college before they turn seniors yeah like Jordan so you don't yeah yeah so you don't really get to keep the the nucleus of your best talent for the whole four years huh well this has been fun i've enjoyed talking with you okay God bless and you have a good day now bye-bye all right you too thanks bye okay so regarding this proposal um personally i guess my my initial feeling is that it it would be a great experience for kids um i i don't think that they really get that sort of experience working with the community uh-huh through school through college i i just don't think people have that opportunity anymore yeah probably not as much so i think it would be a great way to keep kids busy so that they you know they they don't get on the wrong track um you know so that they they have someplace to go after school and they feel like they're producing um i mean who knows what they may be doing in their free time if they don't participate in something like this you know right i guess my i you know i come out am sitting on the fence but i have some concerns about uh you know if you require someone to do this for a year or two um-hum um-hum that's a big chunk out of someone's life uh certainly you know there could be advantages and things to be learned um-hum um-hum but on the other hand you know how do you enforce it or what if they are just totally against it then does it really um-hum benefit anybody you know um-hum that's true so that's true i mean it might turn people more off than on if they're forced to do something that they don't want to do right i guess a year is a long time maybe six months might be a little bit more reasonable um-hum but i can see a lot of benefits in that it might uh interest some people that had never thought of maybe going into social work or right or that sort of thing um and gosh we all know that there's a need for that or might teach them a little more empathy towards those who you know have problems and need help with things um-hum um-hum that's true well i was thinking too um we usually think of the Peace Corps as going overseas to do something but if they required this where you stay in the US and you know benefit the people here and perhaps too the fact that we have more elderly people now um um-hum uh you know it could be an advantage to them um-hum i think it would be nice if they could you almost give it as course credit um um-hum you know um have it be just like real life teaching in a sense and maybe then uh people are feeling like they're getting something out of it too but that certainly everyone else would be getting something out of them participating and and i mean i i even think that that sort of experience is worth a lot more than reading a textbook sometimes yeah yeah well and probably too even those who might initially be opposed once they got into it then they you know would see that hey this this is giving me some benefit as well i mean they they might not express it in words so much but just sort of get in step with with uh what's going on and and really enjoy it um-hum right um-hum yeah when i was in college i worked um with a group and i actually ran a Big Brother Big Sister program hm and besides just you know having this extracurricular thing i really noticed that it gave people a sense of commitment you know they learned that they need to if they make a a if they have a responsibility especially if it's dealing with another person you know someone else might be relying on them for something um you know depending on them to either be somewhere or take someone someplace or something like that yeah you know that that you really learn to to be dependable you know you learn that when someone's relying on you you need to be there uh-huh i think a lot of our young people need to learn that oh it's really it's true oh older ones too i know a few of those yeah well i i work at a in a personnel agency and um i've just found the work ethics of people to be disgusting yeah i mean you know i'll someone might not show up for work and you'll call them and oh they overslept or oh they just didn't feel like going to work and so i lose my job i'll get another one um-hum yeah i don't understand that either that's that's tough i i i know i mean i wish i was lucky enough to not want to work you know but um i mean perhaps that this sort of training early in life before people develop bad habits might not be such a bad idea but yeah but you know it is it is a commitment and perhaps these people would rather be doing something else just as constructive and we're making them do that yeah well another thing too is if you have uh some young people who are really gifted and who are leaning towards maybe the uh math and science and that sort of thing which they say we have a shortage of yeah um-hum taking them away from that which they are centered on might you know be a a bad thing to take a couple years out of beginning you know their life in that respect they might you know get off on some other track but you know it's hard to say um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah yeah it is i don't know i think it's a very interesting um discussion you know and and there's certainly uh lots of pros and cons around it um-hum um i i wish i had that sort of choice i mean maybe maybe it could end up being a choice and things that um you know what the problem is that now it's seen as almost a punishment like when somebody um i don't know remember wasn't it Zsa Zsa Gabor that had to do community service work for like a year yeah oh yeah and she didn't get around to it very much right right or something like that and a lot of um you felonies felony people you know have to do this sort of community service um-hum and i think it's getting the wrong sort of uh um connotation with it it shouldn't be looked at as a punishment right it shouldn't be looked at something to do to make up for other things that you did yeah i i think it needs to be community service needs to have more of a positive um light towards it and have it look as something you know that you did because you wanted to do it because you saw the benefits out of it and not as something that you know oh you you did it instead of going to jail for three months or something like that i mean that's that's a feeling i get now and yeah i i wouldn't want it i wouldn't want to be one of those people that's being taken care of somehow knowing that this person is doing it to get out of a sentence or or you know because they were bad in some other way yeah yeah but i guess that's not a terrible alternative if you've you know you've done something that's not too terrible but they want to slap your hand a little bit so um-hum but bad enough right yeah that's true better than ju st sitting in jail all day not doing anything but but yeah i agree with your point it yeah right yeah it might not make the other person feel like you were really wanting to be there yeah really important yeah that's true well this has been interesting well i yeah enjoyed talking to you all right bye-bye you too take care bye-bye hi Phil how you doing pretty good how many children did you say you had i have three i didn't say i i have three of them yeah two uh i have the girl is the oldest and then two boys wow you have three children boys girls i have uh three as well uh mine are uh uh twenty five twenty four and twenty one the numbers keep changing so it's hard for me to remember yeah well you're doing a lot better than i can i can't rattle them off like that i know my youngest is eighteen he's uh as i said in a senior in high school but i have a uh my oldest son he's uh out seeing the world right now he's in Australia at the present time wow so you don't get a chance to to spend much time with him then until when he comes home well he's yeah he's been gone for about seven months now we're expecting him to be getting home here before too much longer hopefully wow i uh unfortunately didn't spend enough enough time with my children uh where i i had a lot of things that i thought that i needed to do that were more important than than spending time with my children in fact when they were younger uh i was attending school ouch yeah and then i found myself short of cash so i uh also went in for a part-time job so by the time that i got home after my second job um children either in bed or just getting ready to go to bed and the only time that i got to see them was on weekends and on weekends i had to do my homework so it uh it yeah you know it took away a lot of of time from them we did go out to you know to the places that you typically take children to and we had a lot of fun but it seems as though the time went by so fast that right that i i didn't really enjoy it as much as i could have if i worked at it a little harder i'll bet that story's all too common i uh it's it's unbelievable how fast you know you when when you get to the point where even your kid's age they don't want to spend time with you anymore and you know i yeah they sure develop their own interests i can i can remember when my children used to beg me to go with you know even to take them to the store or take them someplace and and it just gradually goes away until you have to ask them do you want to come with me and then they start saying no so it can be pretty sudden too well it it's not sudden it's just that it probably doesn't hit the average person uh until it hits them over the head yeah maybe so uh uh because you because even even my oldest uh child when he comes uh comes to the house he's still he's still my my my child and and i don't think of him as an adult yet and uh that that's one of his complaints yeah i don't think i uh i would have to say i probably didn't get to spend as much time as i would have liked to either uh however i did you know uh early on i was in the retail business and i worked late hours so i saw less of them then but then when i changed over and got into electronics industry i uh uh-huh i did have more time and i tried to spend some more time with them and uh you know we did things as a family we went camping quite a bit and we uh you know took trips went to see my folks in Florida and and some of those kind of things so you had a bunch a bunch of kids in the car that must have that must have that must have been fun yeah we did we did quite a bit of that just traveling and we had several Volkswagen buses there for a period of time in our later years then we did when we were camping and stuff and that made it a little easier or a station wagon well camping is one thing that i i could never get used to uh i i used to take the kids to go fishing and things like that but i never went uh never went camping uh-huh that may be the difference in our part of the country we live in it's a lot easier to get out outside all year round uh well pretty near all year round out here yeah yeah up in uh New England it's uh uh you know three or four or five months tops after that you're in the house because it becomes so cold out here that uh and sometimes the weather gets to you so you don't want to go outside and drive around yeah i guess uh i can think of a uh uh things i would like to have done differently on uh on the kids though well i can think of of some enjoyable things that that i did with the kids like we used to go up to uh New Hampshire quite a bit and go to the uh uh the White Mountains area and and visit all the you know the nature trails and things like that um-hum but i wouldn't sleep on the ground i went into a hotel but i used to take the kids to uh you know the things like uh the places where there are animals and you go in and and feed the animals and things like that and uh yeah uh-huh oh yeah petting zoos and things yeah hey you know and the and the kids used to enjoy that as well and i like children in fact uh one of the things that i notice a dramatic change was that that uh like if i'd be in a supermarket and i'd see a cute little kid i wouldn't think twice about patting the kid on the head um-hum well as time grew by and i think i had my daughter with me one time and she went strolling away and i saw this kid and i patted her on the head and the mother turned around and saw me and took the kid away you know pulled the kid and i and i turned around and i realized my daughter wasn't there anymore so all she saw was a an adult standing there patting her kid on the head so i i i didn't realize it until after uh you know after it all happened what what the uh the oh yeah oh oh the sort of person uh it was uh really something our kids played uh ball it wasn't it was like you know Little League and uh it was Dads Oaks Dads Club which was a like a Little League uh-huh you attend a lot of their games yeah we used to go to the games and we had uh i never did actually coach i'd go do some of the sideline stuff and like that but i never did actually coach but they tried to get me to do that i but we'd go you know and watch them practice and uh-huh and uh pick them up and carry them there and that kind of thing did you spend as much time with your daughter as you did with your sons uh i personally don't believe i did no for one reason being like i mentioned i was in retail when she was younger uh-huh and then you know she being a girl i guess she probably uh spent a lot of time with her mother more so than with me yeah i i uh i felt that myself myself as i as i grew older my child grew older that i realized that i didn't spend half as much time with my daughter as i did my sons because uh i'd want to do the things that i thought that they would like to do and it would always be the things that i wanted to do without realizing it you know things like uh you know fishing and and doing outside things outside and my daughter didn't like doing those things so she ended up spending more time with her mother than uh um-hum oh yeah uh than with myself and i think uh she's closer to her mother today than than she is to me because of that yeah that's probably the same case in our family too yeah it's unfortunate because yeah you know even even though you you think of them as a whole family when you do things sometimes you separate them without even realizing it yeah a lot of cases daughters getting get real close to their dads too you know and uh yeah well she was close but yet whenever i wanted to do something it was always something something different than what she wanted to do yeah yeah um i spent a lot of time with her when i was home uh she'd always be the one you know sitting on my lap or being close to me and the two guys would be off uh uh playing someplace but it seems like whenever i wanted to do something like go out for the kids and uh she'd always say well i want to go to my girlfriend's house or i want to stay home and do this or she had like little projects she was working on at home and things like that so i i kind of missed that um i my daughter especially uh being with her is your daughter the uh oldest no she's the the second oldest she's uh twenty twenty three now oh middle child you uh you have you ever heard much about that theory about the uh you know how their different their their position in the family relates to their uh character you know some of their personality traits and things like that uh no i can't say that i have mannerisms and personality yeah yeah i believe it's true it's my experiences uh what i know about it and then observing it with my kids at least and then like some other people's children too it's uh you know it's uh you know the older kid is uh is more always more prone to be more like responsible and that kind of thing uh-huh yeah i think you force it on them and and the youngest one tends to be the one that's spoiled yeah it is a natural development i think it yeah and uh in our case he he's real sensitive and real uh thoughtful and uh the youngest one is more sensitive that's same with my family and it's it's strange yes i don't know if yeah i don't know if that relates to that or not but well it just so happens that my youngest is uh extremely sensitive uh where my oldest one uh you know i can scream at him and yell at him and he'll look at me with with my oldest yeah my oldest daughter is hard headed as can be but if i say the wrong thing to my youngest son he he will he won't cry anymore because he's too old but he gets hurt he bruises very easily and and i can feel that yeah right that's that's Matthew he's it's boy uh he was always he just he'd keep it to himself a lot of times but he'd really kind of well up and yeah and be ready to cry or whatever he's gotten now to where he can take it better he'll dish it back a little bit but i remember when i first took my kids out uh fishing and again i was with my two sons and not with my daughter but uh no i was with my oldest son uh my youngest son wasn't old enough or i didn't think he was old enough to take out and uh uh we caught this fish it was uh it was a fairly large size fish and he was very very proud it of he put it on the backseat on the floor and it was waggling around and we we came home and he uh he wanted to show his mom what he caught because it was his first fish and he wanted to put it in the bathtub so she told him no he couldn't do it but he did it anyway fill the water filled the bathtub full of water and uh huh uh put the fish in it now after the fish died from being handled so much uh we brought the fish and he put it out in the swimming pool so after he realized the fish wasn't going to come back uh to life again we went out there and they buried it uh and uh you know we did did it together and i i come in the house and i wash my hands and i turn around and i did something and i saw the kids out there with sticks digging it up again and i went out there said what are you doing he said i wanted to show my friend the fish that i caught yeah so he's so he's out there digging it up yeah that was i'm sure it was a powerful experience for him it's something he'll remember yeah well it was his first fish he didn't he didn't want to hide it he wanted everybody um regarding health care it's funny because i have a sister who lives in Europe and in Europe that's the way it is health care is just um-hum they have socialized socialized health care right exactly and um the the interesting thing is that it seems that they don't even think about it it's not anything that seems to be um you know costing everybody a lot of money it's not a major topic of conversation it's just something that's done and accepted how do they pay for it how is it financed well um i think the government subsidizes most of it but i i believe that that again just people are taxed oh a little bit more but it's just interesting how something you know that we consider just such a major issue is just in such working order there yeah you know what do you feel about it well i feel like something needs to be done here and i'm definitely in favor of the government i just think medical you know medical costs have as i've seen over the years just go up and up and up and already just this year yes you know i'm a single parent and you know i have to pay for medical insurance and it's just outrageous my son you know has got allergies and he's got this and he's got that and he broke his arm i mean and you know it's a thousand dollars here a thousand dollars there um-hum um um-hum and you know even though the insurance is paying eighty percent of it you're pay an arm and a leg for the insurance first of all and then you're still paying yeah the twenty percent and so um-hum the twenty percent and and the sad part is that people to to you know combat this they just won't go to the doctor or they won't fill their prescriptions yeah or they can't yeah they just can't i mean that you know that's the alternative yeah i've been in positions before where i've had to wait a few days you know to have a prescription filled because i just didn't have it um-hum um-hum and i don't think that that's fair i don't think it's fair you know to the kids and and to the people that are sick and i know that you know i know um-hum every city has you know their you know their free hospitals or whatever and i know a few people that have had experiences in those um-hum i've been fortunate enough not to but i mean you could go down there half dead and still wait you know it's hard to see a doctor from what i've heard oh i know i know oh yeah it's true and i don't think that that burden should be put on companies either i don't think that they should have to assume the responsibility of paying for the person's health care well yeah there's a lot of people that um you know don't work oh yeah um-hum you know and don't have it you know any other means they've and so they either don't again don't have it or they have to take it out themselves and pay an arm and a leg for it um-hum um-hum you know i'm thinking of you know i just did my tax return for the last year you know if your medical bills are more than a certain percent of your income um-hum um-hum you know it's worthwhile to itemize and and last year i was the first year we reached that mark um-hum oh you did where my medical where it was worth it to itemize for medical expenses because they were just they were that much of a percentage of my income that it just wow um-hum um-hum you know i just did it it's very frustrating a hot topic for me i know well and well you know you're not the only one though um i'm in a situation where when i started my job they were paying full benefits i thought great you know can't get any better and then slowly each year you know now they're down to seventy five percent and then they went down to fifty percent and and i understand they have to do that with the prices going up and up um-hum um-hum but um you just might as well knock of a couple thousand dollars from your salary you know to pay for this medical care and then i i don't have kids so i'm not worrying about family coverage oh at least at least but once you get into family coverage it's crazy oh it's out it's outrageous and then a lot of companies you know offer you know you can have a certain amount deducted pre tax from your pay check for medical expenses but not covered by insurance but it it's just crazy yes you know that's something that's something fairly new and not a lot of people take advantage of it but it's you know it's use it or lose it and i um-hum um-hum know people at the end of the year you know that have had that money checked out regularly and then it's like well let's see i guess i could go get a new of glasses you know right they have a hundred dollars to spend in December i know what you mean you know get a big crown done you know things like that but yeah we do that too we're fortunate though this year somehow how it's only March and we've already used up our entire amount i don't know if that's good or bad i know yeah um do you think that that that the insurance and all they've got in Europe does it cover dental or is it just medical i don't know um i think it covers a portion because like i said my sister lives over there and they they just they just never have to worry about it i think it might not cover full dental but it does cover some and again it covers you know um-hum major things it won't cover cosmetic type things you know if you choose to do something but um it's just like all in it's just all in practice it's all in plan i think that we could learn from that yeah what motivates people to go into medicine are the doctors you know how how do the doctors i don't know i really don't know i know that they do equally as well there as they do here i mean doctors still have that same status they do so they're getting paid i don't know i guess they're getting paid for it one way or another and and i would imagine although i don't know maybe there still are private practices there i don't know yeah i yeah i don't know either i don't know but um it would be great and and if only i mean health is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with you know especially that makes a good society when people are healthy and they're not you know they're not stealing for money to pay for their doctors' bills yeah you know they're they're going to work every day because they're not sick you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now yeah i definitely agree and i remember back in high school being on the debate team and that was one of the subjects one of the debates should we have you know national health care and i remember debating for it yeah um-hum um-hum well at least let them start off gradually you know fine so they won't jump into paying full health care let them pay you know partial and each year just you know let's increase it from there yeah yeah right i don't know but i i don't know it's going to be hard to switch i think that we're going eventually end up end up that way though i just don't see how we can yeah i think it'll take um-hum it'll take a while maybe our grandchildren will know it i agree it'll take a while but i think we have to be headed yeah um-hum have to be headed in that direction um-hum well it was nice tal king to you yeah maybe one day we'll all have health care nice talking to you too first person from not from Texas that i've talked to it's what you're the first person not from Texas that i've talked to oh i know like i said everyone's been in from Texas all righty well take care okay bye-bye okay you too bye-bye okay well i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows okay and they kind of are in different spectrums i think um one of them's Quantum Leap and the other one is Night Court and i think i think they're real different i mean i don't think they have anything in common uh Quantum Leap has i mean Quantum Leap is kind of okay a comedy in its own way i guess but uh mostly it's it's kind of science fiction and it's um adventure and things like that um and then Night Court is just pure you know weird fun you know just um-hum it's it's nothing serious about it at all so i don't know why the two of them happen to be my two favorite shows but they that's the way it is so it's funny that those are my two husband's my husband's two favorite shows too and i enjoy both watching both of them but i used to didn't like Night Court um-hum and i and the only reason i think i like it now is because i've seen it so much now i'm involved with the characters but yeah i used to think um Dan Fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me and and i told my husband that's the whole point but i i just it's he is yeah that's right i mean i find him degrading at times and i guess that is the point but sometimes it just well they they really have changed him though if if you've watched it this season um he's becoming i mean he still is in his own way degrading and everything but uh he's involved in that charity and uh it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has in fact there was one show that he even turned down a date with some you know beautiful woman just because the idea that he was his mind was on the ozone layer and you know global warming and all this other kind of stuff oh and he you know was too depressed you know to so that was part of i guess his character building or whatever but um-hum i i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character i haven't watched um which of course he needed i think uh yeah i think so which in Quantum Leap you get even though the the person is involved in so many other people's lives you still see a a real person in those situations he gets um he's doing amazing things but he's doing them within the bounds of what of normal person would do and i think that's i like that um-hum right right that's that's good point so what do you what do you consider your favorite shows though um i think my favorite show is Hunter and i i like the old series series better when um okay Deedee Deedee was in there yes yeah i agree and um so uh and then the the blonde that they took out the one that got killed yeah i can't remember what her name is but uh yeah i didn't enjoy her i i she was too much of a opposite of Deedee and i think that's what they try to do but i think we wanted to see Deedee there or somebody like her um-hum well but see i read an article about uh in TV Guide about uh about Hunter and about his latest you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them uh-huh and they say that uh that there was absolutely that there was like a a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use i mean you know uh the second lady uh-huh yeah yeah the second one the blonde uh you know if you think about it they didn't really interact hardly at all i mean they were never partners they didn't yeah she would go her way and he would do his and i think that's what i didn't like yeah and uh and and even even at the beginning Deedee and and Hunter and would decide that one of them would go do this while the other one would do would go this but uh it seemed like it was almost two different organizations um-hum you know like like Hunter was the boss and and this other girl was not and you know you kind of you're wondering you know well when did this happen you know right so yeah i i i kind of agree with that and i like the new lady better but i'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there i'd just as soon have the the police story without all the romance well i'm afraid that's what they they really wanted to do um yeah i think most shows were doing that and then they went away from it and now they're starting to go back to it and maybe that's what the public wants i don't know but i just um-hum i like the the cut and dry solve the mystery and that's what i always enjoyed about it yeah well see there was that spark between Deedee and Hunter for a while but they they like started it and then they'd pull it back and they'd start it and pull it back and that really made it a very interesting yeah uh show to where you never really knew which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good but um um-hum you know it's it i guess you know you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they don't you know get together or whatever and so i guess that's what they decide to do yeah just go ahead and quit the wondering and and yeah but it's it's always been a formula uh for TV that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married that the show ends up well you know dying yeah a a good example of this and uh you know this is uh probably well maybe it's not a good example i've been watching Nickelodeon all last week uh because they had uh what they called Maximum Smart they had Get Smart for uh ten hours a day from seven o'clock at night until six or until five o'clock the next morning uh-huh oh all the Get Smart episodes you could ever see well the the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them got married and that was i mean that was the killer the series died right after that because well go ahead um-hum yeah i didn't i was going to say i didn't ever watch Moonlighting but i heard that's what killed it that that uh interplay died when they got married and so the show died um-hum the same thing yeah the it it it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know the minute they get married everything's supposed to be cut and dried and um-hum right and well of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the character's uh uh personalities um um well especially after they get married um halfway through yeah yeah couple of examples would be um well like i said this one about uh Max or Get Well Smart uh the female character uh Barbara Feldon um-hum she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who everyone always solved the things and and figured out and kept Max from getting real messed up well toward whenever they got married she got dingy oh you know why would they do that yeah it it made no sense i i'm guess it's going falling back into our traditional stereotypes which a lot of shows yeah unfortunately that's probably true yeah which kind of like in the big soap opera shows which i don't enjoy because of that um-hum but well do you watch um what is that show uh Who's the Boss it's uh that's on Tuesday nights i think i've seen it before but i don't watch it regularly usually Tuesday nights i'm out so yeah the well i yeah i hardly ever watch it but uh as as i've seen it they've they've done sort of the same thing to where they've they started to let them get together and then they pulled them apart um-hum and i think they're thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them uh get together then you lose part of what the show's all about so i always thought that was kind of weird um-hum yeah it's funny how we uh we we romanticize people uh like well for instance when i was a teenager you know you romance um-hum romanticize a rock star but when he gets married then you don't care anymore or something like that and i think it's the same with your characters on TV hum right well do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages a secret or at least they keep it quiet probably yeah i know it affected me when i was younger i'm not into rock stars too much lately but yeah i mean yeah now like Madonna and Sean Penn now i don't particularly like either one of them but um um-hum uh their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together yeah uh or at least that's the way i look at it um-hum so i don't know it would have been hard wouldn't it yeah i would think so i i just the the publicity in and of itself much less the i mean when you get married you've got relationship to develop in the first place so um-hum having twenty million people watch you do that yeah it's it wouldn't be easy yeah so hum well that's kind of interesting yeah so um well i guess i guess that's about all we need to do isn't it yeah i think we've covered our time it's been good talking to you yeah it has Becky i really appreciate it oh you're the first man i've talked to everybody else has been a female so this is a change well i think i've um you're the second female i've talked to you've had a little bit of variety huh okay well thanks so much bye-bye yeah it's it's kind of nice so uh-huh bye-bye where do you get most of your current events oh well when the war was on i was watching the T V a lot uh-huh but um i haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed down yeah yeah i was i was uh we don't have cable so we were watching C N N a lot and then trying to switch thank goodness for remote control uh-huh yeah we were switching from one station to another and in between keeping the radio on yeah C N N coverage was really good it was extraordinary yeah we um um and then you know couldn't wait for the newspaper reminded me of when i was younger the uh the time of Watergate and just couldn't get enough of it yeah yeah but uh it kind of get wrapped up in it yeah um i it was the first couple of nights sitting up and watching T V late into the evening and you just wanted to get the latest news what was happening yeah kind of like watching the Olympics huh kind of like watching the Olympics yeah yeah you just couldn't you couldn't put it down you couldn't put it down yeah after a while though it started getting a little repetitive it ran out of news it did yeah it was like you know that what was it two steps forward one step back yeah and uh but occasionally you know you'd stay in tune just long enough to get the latest different tidbit or a different angle and uh you really became addicted to it for a while right right do you uh normally read the newspaper every day i try to um the newspaper comes uh in the morning and i leave for work at seven huh yeah yeah and i usually don't get a chance to sit down until after work the what the Post pretty good newspaper uh-huh and at that point i try at least try to get through most most the front section and maybe you know one or two other sections yeah i don't i don't regularly watch news or uh newspaper i would say i get probably most of it from my friends you know they finally told me hey there's a war going on oh okay uh-huh where do what what newspaper do you get uh there uh just the Raleigh local paper how does it how does compare have you can you compare like how does it compare to the Post oh it's it's it's not even a comparison yeah that's funny because every once in a while if my husband and i have traveled or something um and we pick up a local paper we're really shocked even in a major city at how local it is it's really provincial yeah yeah the news is the same way the news local news here is kind of lousy is it really i mean it's not much different than when i lived in Roanoke Virginia which is really small town that's that's maybe because we get so you know we're so jaded with the Post uh yeah which is really international and and it keeps reminding me you know that this we're we're really in an in an isolated different situation here and i keep saying no wonder the rest of the people in the world vote for in the country vote the way they do i mean yeah that explains it but uh i probably do watch more T V because i get home and in between say cooking dinner or something if i can catch a five or six o'clock news right right i watch that usually uh before we settle down uh depending what time we get to bed we'll usually watch the ten or the eleven o'clock news we have a ten o'clock news here at night and that's ideal uh-huh um yeah because because by ten thirty i start to fade so uh i'm in graduate school so i have a really weird schedule and i don't know i really don't have time for T V and newspaper just i wouldn't i wouldn't have time to read it so i'm what are you studying like yeah i remember when i was in school yeah finding the latest thing out from my friends is usually the most uh time effective yeah yeah no i can remember way back back in those days when i was in school the i think the only time we only really watched the news and this tells you how old i was was during the Cuban missile crisis yeah uh i we could just we were all centered around that television yep what's neat is seeing history happen you know that's exactly right and i'd i guess that's it yeah although i do worry that how easy this one was might be a bad lesson uh to the to the younger people um you know than there is the other generation yeah um in North Carolina there was a lot lot of service men from here you know and people really saw that oh that's true yeah yeah saw it first hand that was probably the best part of the news was the uh some of the person human interest stories yeah some of it got a little i i don't know i thought it was a little too personal that they were digging each other life uh-huh yeah yeah little too much maybe does it does it bother you that uh at this point in your life that you're not getting more direct news or uh no not really what are you studying i'm in computer science okay yeah um i guess i see it as information age yeah how old are you i'm twenty five okay then i'm see i'm about twenty years older yeah and i really do i do rely i do miss it i do rely on the news and uh i i guess i regret i don't get enough local really local we get some local papers but i guess i'm more interested in the national or international news uh-huh it's almost getting to the point where there is there's too much that overload news overload yeah you shouldn't even worry about most of the stuff i mean i don't know it's a little near sighted but uh yeah but well it's hard i'll i'll tell you though it is hard when you go to vote i mean there are so many issues and there're so many people running that you know unless you have some way of evaluating it yeah yeah and i guess the news does help well it was really nice talking talking to you okay okay did it work out your first time all right i hope so okay alright bye-bye take care bye-bye have you had to put anyone in a nursing home no but my husband's mother was in a nursing home um and she was in there she got sick and they put her in a nursing home because you couldn't we couldn't afford a nurse to you know all all day nurse yeah twenty four hours yeah well at least as they told us uh two shifts oh you know that's sixteen hours because one would come in the morning and one would be at night i mean in the afternoon and then that night it wouldn't need one yeah yeah you know because she would be sleeping so i would be here then yeah that would seem like that would be uh more expensive than a uh nursing nursing home wouldn't it well the nursing home is covered by uh social security see oh and the nurse at home isn't oh okay i got you and the nurses aren't no see you have to pay that yeah i didn't know that and oh yeah if you put nursing home and that's another thing i you know you got to find a good nursing home is very hard to find because the people don't care most of them don't care some of them do care the work that you know the the nurse aide that what the problem is i think it's the nurses' aide they don't pay them enough to keep them there and to do the things that they need to do now well my brother in law was working with uh in one for a little bit and uh he just he couldn't handle the things he had to do uh-huh you know uh cleaning up after men uh men and women using the restroom and stuff he he he couldn't handle it oh yeah it's gets bad some of them and then it depends on the nursing home and how bad it is you know because they have some nursing home that don't have anybody that's not walking you know yeah and it just depends on how bad that person is well seems to me if a person gets into that area they i i don't know it seems like if you're going to get in that area and spend the time learning it because you do have to go to school on some of it yeah uh you ought to do your job yeah and um and if you can't if you can't i think they should get out of it instead of mistreating the people yeah i i've heard a lot of bad things about them mistreating people and uh well i've even heard of some people being sexually abused they steal yeah that and they steal yeah they steal from them uh oh yeah i used to take uh every week you know i have to threaten it which it doesn't make sense for me to have to sit there and threaten uh people um that work there i didn't yeah you know like i bring her i bought her a blanket and i had this girl hand crocheted her a lap blanket you know because she sits in a wheel chair but she can walk they just sit them in wheel chairs and i told her uh i came up there the following week and it was gone i said where is it she said in the washer i said i tell you what when i come back it better be here because they went to the washer we didn't find it i said you all better find it yeah and you know bedspread her bedspread she i took her a bedspread because she a comforter because she was always cold yeah and so uh you know then i had to put write the name on the whole bedspread i'm talking uh like it's in each square it almost you know on both sides so that they can't turn it over and put it on somebody else's bed all over that's that's not right huh-uh i've i've only known two people in a nursing home and you know it was my grandmother and grandfather on my father's side and i just heard through my father what was going on and uh yeah well see this this one i i is more or less first hand you know she just died um we buried her February but she had been in there at least i know for seven years eight years and he didn't want to put her in there but he can't afford it yeah and that's another thing you know yeah something i guess you get forced to do make decisions and but you don't have it depends on when didn't you you have a choice the only thing i can say is you have a choice of where they go sometimes yeah sometimes you don't and then you have to check out the nursing home and the only way you're going to check out a nursing home is to actually put them in there and check on them every time but don't tell the people what time you going to come in just come in uh yeah you have to do one of them you know spontaneous things like maybe three o'clock in the afternoon or one o'clock in the afternoon and stuff like that because they're not expecting you yeah yeah you know they expect you Saturday like on Saturdays Friday you know Saturdays and Sundays and Friday and stuff but not during the week yeah hum-um it gets bad it is nursing home i think is sometimes i think some people put them in there and then they just die that's about what it's for and it's really not some people don't need to be in there you know that's what i've heard too you know i heard that they just put them in there because they don't want to mess with them that's right and i don't think that's right i think they should have a place to some of the people that don't need to be in the nursing home with nurses they need to have a place for them like a retirement home well yeah i've heard uh some things you know uh i i don't where i heard it from it might have been a movie or something where they made a apartment complex into a what you're saying for people who can take care of themselves but they they uh need a little help in doing it yeah don't yeah and see that would be okay you could have somebody check on each one of them every day you know go by and see what they need yeah each of them have their own little apartment or little little place to live you know even just a little room or whatever yeah well do they share rooms in nursing homes sometimes yeah it depends on the patient and and i guess sometimes the availability of that of the room and how they done built the hospitals because i know one lady like she had a roommate but the woman across the hall didn't have one um get my purse uh but it it it you know it just to me nursing homes are um bad news bad news unless you can find a really good one and those are rare but there are some good ones and there are some bad ones i mean well i'll i'll say something i said in the last conversation i hope i'm never in that position where i have to be put in one uh from all i've heard about it just not and i've heard i told my husband well is this weird because see what people don't understand is even the people that work in the nursing home they will get old one day yeah and everything that they do to somebody will come back to them that's the way i feel yeah well if it ain't uh well you know uh or maybe that won't not make it that far in life for what they did to somebody but well yeah i have my beliefs in the hereafter and i believe that uh God will take care of them that's the whole that's what i think i think God will definitely get uh you know uh there's two people that i know you should not mess uh abuse and that's a child and a someone person that's elderly you shouldn't abuse anybody but but down right true them people them two people are the most helpless people you see what i'm saying yeah you know they can't really defend themselves like somebody grown uh say my age you know yeah or mine yeah i got you there because i can tell somebody to go leave me alone but they so old or you can force them to do it if you know yeah you can force their hand more or less but see somebody that old they don't know yeah uh and then what they what are they going to do and if they tell anybody people always say oh they're just senile you know huh-uh and that ain't right neither no it's not so it it it gets bad you know it just depends on like i said the nursing home now my grandmother was in a nursing home in California before she died but it was a nice nursing home for you know it was one of the nice ones yeah but now my mom and them had to pay for that too yeah i was going to say you have to pay something like three and four times more you have to pay more you know social security covers so much and then um you have to pay some more and she chose to pay some more well if she you know since it was like my my grandmother had thirteen kids so they all you know paid their month which was better but see my husband's a only child yeah and then he'd have to pay it all yeah yeah i know what big families are like and how they can get together if you if they're really cooperative and wanting the best if yeah see and then there's another thing she told me is you have to make sure everybody cooperates because like by her her being there if someone if one of her brothers didn't send in their check she would have to pay it yeah you know and wait for him to whenever he decide to pay it you know yeah well i know my mom from a family of at least sixteen i've lost count uh and my grandmother just died sometime last well about two years ago um-hum um-hum and uh they was all talking about pulling together and paying for the uh hospital costs and stuff and uh you know there's some of my family that's not exactly in the homeless level but you know darn close yeah yeah and uh then there's others who is uh-huh lots better off just pretty oh yeah see that's what that's what gets me like well just like my brother he has got his five bedroom house and in California with the swimming pool and here i am renting a house barely making it you know well in California too i've got a friend that lives out there and uh she's got a little two three bedroom house with a garage a double car garage and it's costing her a thousand dollars a month um-hum California is high yeah and then you know it's like i tell him you make more money than i do than i could ever really think about if i made as much money as my brother i would be just like set for life that's what we keep saying you know but not him he's never happy and i think that's that's why he makes as much as he do is because he keeps thriving for more uh well that's which i probably if i got what i wanted i'd be okay you know well that's a good initiative uh i guess if but and i guess okay um so uh um uh do you have any favorite teams well i kind of like them all i played for about eighteen years all all the way through college and then uh kind of hung them up after college but oh i was going to say you played pro ball right no not quite not quite huh made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but well that's pretty good anyway uh being in Rochester you probably like the Mets yes i'm actually a Met's fan i'm i'm one of these people who's actually a die hard Met fan and an avid Yankee hater oh boy it the i think it's like one or the other isn't it i mean you either yeah it's it's i i i find it very strange um more people you know real Met fans don't like the Yankees and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason yeah i never found i never quite found a New York fan i've always found a fan you know of of either one or the other and so that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox oh okay by default because i went to college also in Boston i see yeah i i like the uh uh i guess if i had to pick a favorite team i'd i anymore uh well as i kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia oh i'm from New Jersey originally yeah so that that's sort of close enough yeah well we were thirty miles south of them so oh so you were pretty close right yeah right down the river but uh so what are the Mets going to do this year without Strawberry well i don't know um there's there's a part of me that says that you know i'm i'm sort of glad Strawberry went away you know when when he sort of went away i started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well but he really wasn't worth the baggage you know yeah um i think they're okay i think they're you know i think they have enough people who are who are who are still in their prime you know um i mean certainly if you look at them compared to let's say you know um um-hum just eight years ago or something they're they're they're they're you know they're sort of in in good standing whereas you know um i think yeah i certainly don't think that they're the eighty six team anymore uh well i was going to talk to you about that eighty six team that was that was the year that uh they beat Houston in uh extra innings right yeah i right they were either beat Houston in extra innings and then and then they actually won the series by by sort of a sneaky route um against Boston yeah yeah when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner to Buckner yeah i felt real bad about that but hey what can you do hey the guy's making millions he ought to be able to perform right that's right well actually he he he was supposedly um there was there was something wrong with him at the time and i well his knees were bothering him yeah right and i and i understand that and i say hey if the guy can't play you don't blame the team that uh hit it to him you blame the team you know for putting him in yeah for having him out there that's right so sure so i i i was uh i was also i was in school at Boston at the time oh oh boy so i it was actually wonderful because where i was there were half Met fans and um half Sox fans yeah i think we were all pretty much uh Astros fans in the in the National National League Championship Series but there's like two fellows oh yeah from uh Brooklyn and they they were you know they were they were pretty much without having to say it they were pretty much Mets fans yeah yeah well i guess they were uh i guess they must have been scared no not really they they were they were pretty much thugs they weren't scared of very much you know after the uh well that's good well yeah Brooklyn boys i guess yeah you don't expect them to be uh much of anything but thugs no i know i was born there um yeah really yeah so i i was i was also born in Brooklyn so i so i can call myself a Brooklyn thug although i'm really not okay okay well i'm not to say that all folks from Brooklyn are thugs but these two were definitely thugs and they were from Brooklyn so i'm kind of hoping i i i guess uh anymore i pretty much pull for the Rangers though they were uh they're they're they're they they have the i think they have the best facilities in the major leagues yeah i love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium it's great well that that's actually i think that makes something because i think and and and as much as sort of fan support helps yeah you know it's good to have um the only problem is it's not large enough it only holds about i think they squeezed when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player they they squeezed about forty thousand people in there yes it is kind of small yeah so they're they're they have plans i mean the the owner tried to move them to Florida but uh right they ended up sticking around in Arlington and they're going to build a new stadium in Arlington as a matter of fact not even in Dallas so that's oh that's oh that's great so that's something that we're looking forward to yeah that'll be nice i mean that that i think tends to just keep i think stadiums have worked tend to keep people happy oh yeah case in point Toronto and yeah exactly yeah have you seen a game up there uh i haven't been to any Toronto games yet but um oh boy i saw i i was up there on business uh last June and watched a game in the sky dome it was just phenomenal that's that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think of stadiums yeah well i i mean to get up there i mean the the best i've been up here so far you know up in in in up state New York is uh is um yeah uh-huh a Rochester Red Wings game now is is Rochester where where is Cornell University uh Cornell is in Ithaca Ithaca uh yeah so Cornell is about um somewhere uh about two and a half hours south of south and east of us okay so if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of is uh yeah well Rochester's like right on the shores isn't it yeah we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city yeah okay okay um but that uh well they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the lights of Rochester on a clear night oh really i never i hadn't actually known that yeah well um but we have our own um our own triple A team here yeah the Redwings which is the uh farm team for the Orioles so everybody hopes that uh they go all the way around here they're the they're the big team in Rochester yeah okay yeah those games are fun to watch you you you watch those games oh i yeah i actually we we we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they're fun because they're yeah lots of really big you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know um and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know um um-hum um-hum especially you know and i'll um i'll make a day game or something but they really seem to um people really get into it i mean i yeah i can't i i again i can't make any predictions about them but i suspect they'll go uh they'll go far yeah we used to like watching my my folks lived down in Beaumont and uh on on the campus of Lamar University they used to house the the Beaumont Golden Gators who were a double A team for the Padres i think but uh they they were fun games to watch yeah those those are those are always the i i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes sometimes well there's definitely a lot more hitting yes it's true well it's one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are uh uh you know i guess i guess when you start pitching real well well move them up bam you know there goes the little the uh worst team yeah yeah yeah but um so what so as far as the major league teams i don't know it the Rangers have been you you know every year they they always knock on a door early and then just go into their skid about you know the end of June but they they've got so much young raw talent it's just amazing and then they just haven't been able to put anything together uh well the way i the way i see it is i mean um you know i i can use a Met analogy here um-hum if you'll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of well trained you know back to the you know maybe eighty um eighty four or or eighty three or or eighty five you know when they were first when they weren't quite the eighty six team that that that they were um yeah um-hum right i that that probably gives the readers a good shot for you know this year or next year i think it you know the young talent really sort of has to build itself up yeah i mean they've been they've been young for a while and they're almost almost starting to age a little bit here i just um yeah they they're they're really hurting pitching wise i mean they've got Ryan but you know who knows what he'll be able to do he's been last year he started having some nagging injuries and right but that that's if if but it'll it'll be interesting to watch i hope to get up there we we usually try to get to opening day game there's several guys from our church try to go up there oh that must be nice yeah well i i guess we're probably oh maybe a hundred fifty miles south of Dallas well see that isn't too bad a couple hours no not too bad about it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there yeah well it'd take me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium so so i don't know i don't that's probably because of the roads you just don't yeah we we've just got a freeway we just get right on the freeway and just go north yeah well actually we can we can i can take a highway the whole way down but it's still it's um well it's so crowded up there it's it's almost four hundred hours i mean i mean it it's almost four hundred you know barring traffic it's four hundred hours i mean i mean four hundred miles four hundred hours right four hundred miles golly barring traffic so it's um it it's uh you know it's it's a heck of a drive we are substantially north of New York enough that uh we don't get to go play yeah um too often well i don't know you're you're you're like a boat ride from how how far is it across the lake to Canada Toronto Toronto oh Toronto's only about two hours yeah Toronto is i mean i i want to go see yeah you do you drive there or do you take the ferry or what um i can i've actually i've driven but i've heard about the ferry as well haven't taken it yet though have you taken it yeah yeah it's a it's a beautiful city yeah um i i really love i i think that's one of the most uh enjoyable things about being up here i'm only up here for school i really like it um-hum so i so and then and then you go back to New York after school uh no probably south maybe Texas actually or New York City oh really some place south and warm i don't i'm not a warm i'm not a big uh i'm not a big uh cold fan well what what kind of weather are you having right now uh right now we're actually having uh it's getting nice i mean it was in the high fifties today but three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm oh boy yeah we've been up in the oh seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple weeks ago already oh that's great we're it's yeah well about that same time branches were falling off ev erywhere and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks golly because of the ice okay it didn't make the national national national national news too much which i find really weird hum but um we were i mean um you know all schools were closed for almost for for over or for for a week golly there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive huh illegal yeah because they had so many power lines down and so many uh oh yeah and so many things like that so they were okay well personally i don't have any children i'm twenty two and i'm doing my Master's at NC State so uh uh children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now oh uh-huh well no they wouldn't would they no so what what how do you spend the time with your children well both of mine are boys they're eight and eleven oh okay and they and we're into sports i mean as a matter of fact that's what we're doing tonight yeah what what are you doing uh baseball has started oh okay do do they play like uh like does the eight year old play baseball oh oh yes we start here at uh five okay and and in in in his league do they have like a pitcher or do they have a standing ball or a machine or what up until it's coach pitch until you get nine which my little boy will be nine in May so he's going to be with uh regular pitching and my eleven year old of course you know is pitching okay oh okay yeah i i used to play soccer when i was that age up in New York so uh-huh but yes we're into baseball and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball we even have peewee basketball here so there's always something yeah and how about how about like on the weekends do you do sports or do you go out both if we're not doing sports we go somewhere do you go uh how about like for uh do you go for long vacations like a week or something when they have school off oh yeah yeah yeah in the summer or like in the Easter time like around now no usually in the summer time and where do you go different places every year we have have you been out of the country no oh okay well first they always say get to know your country first before you leave i mean i i lived in places like when i lived in Washington uh Washington DC i never went to the Washington Memorial and then when i went back to visit i went to the Washington Memorial uh-huh you know i've heard we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often and that must be the thing they really hadn't either they went to the Memorial you know because when they go it's on business it's not really just to getting to sight see right right well it's it's a beautiful city and but the problem is like first example when i was young they they took me to Las Vegas and that was the most boring place on earth oh i bet it is too uh-huh oh now my husband and i we go different places but our children but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close yeah did uh did like did you go to Disneyland oh yes yes yes oh okay so but um now i don't know but um but let's see when i was eleven i went also to the Caribbean oh that that was fun that was and uh then after that i my sister lives in Turkey so when i was like fourteen fifteen i went i went to Turkey and this Christmas i went to Turkey but basically oh it's uh for the past couple of years uh i since my parents are are well i'm from Argentina and my parents live down there so all the traveling i do is alone uh-huh and uh we were never much of uh a very uh family thing you know may like go skiing in Vermont or something uh-huh that was uh that was a lot of fun but what happens is we used to fight a lot so there's never much of a family family thing you know one of those hell family vacations yes yeah yes oh yes but we try you know uh i try my husband also we're involved in everything our kids does because uh yeah my dad died you know when i was less than a year old so i always just had a mother so i always thought when i have kids you know i really want to be involved with them yeah well my dad all he all he wanted to do was get money for us so he could buy us material things and uh-huh things yes that is yes and and to me you know it's like now i'm twenty two but i still feel you know it's like yeah we never threw a football or something and the way i was brought up and he wants me now he like he you know like he wants to be best friends now and it's very uh-huh best friends now yes hard for me because you know it's like you grow up to be twenty years old and it's always the same man and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old uh-huh and he wants to be best friends but uh you know it's like yeah i can only express myself so much because you know of everything that he taught me you know that my family taught me which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say i'm sorry you know it's like uh-huh you know i love you and let's go out and do things together when i don't feel like it you know um-hum yeah and so that's uh that the same thing that you know its like when like like i've seen my uncle and his family you know does everything together and you know his kids are you know when his little girl was five years old and everything they uh they would go to the beach and she could go to sleep at two in the morning oh uh-huh yeah you know and uh i was brought up the same way if if it doesn't matter what age you have if just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning you can stay up you know but his what he does is when he gets home he separates his his work from his house yes uh-huh yeah yeah you have to i mean you honestly do now i have friends that i love to death but and they have children but their children does anything we have to take them and yeah yeah you know to do it and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while because you're saying well i work full time too you know yeah yeah but uh it's just it's just something that you know my theory is you know when when you have kids and all you want to do well what i'll do is you know it like i mean you might have a problems but it's not your kids problems you know and you got to try to to be with them as much as you can and to you know like thing is is that you know like if yeah oh yeah uh-huh if they would ever happen to have a drug problem suppose that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying i got a problem problem uh-huh you know and uh and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time you know first of all you're coming to me and let's see how we can get rid of the problem you know yeah yeah yeah yeah and that's uh that's very that's very hard to do because once you're best friends with your parents then i think everything go a lot better uh-huh yeah uh i agree with you very much so now we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college and we knew time wise or and money wise too would it would not have been a good idea to had them then yeah yeah my my father was raising four kids oh well three kids before he had me so it was uh you know you're trying to support uh four kids and it's pretty hard you know and i and i told them listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids yes uh-huh yeah he goes yeah but then i wouldn't have you i go yeah but then you would have a lot of money you know that's right but you can't take this money with us though that's how i keep looking at it yeah but you know like four i mean four four children is expensive especially when you consider like especially for for me which i'm paying out of state tuition i'm paying you know three thousand no what is it two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester oh yes yeah uh-huh oh and uh you know people say you know it's expensive for to send kids to college but if if an everybody would be a little bit responsible you know it's like what what does it cost it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose that they go to a state college and they live at home uh-huh you know and well it costs two hundred dollars for books but you know seven hundred dollars a semester a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead you know like oh yeah if you can't if you can yeah i mean it's like if you plan a year ahead you can probably save up seven hundred dollars you know one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college you know yeah what are you wanting to be oh oh excuse me what degree i mean what are you wanting to do after you get out of college well i i'm doing computer science computer engineering oh that that's my husband's into uh computers yeah and and now i'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home uh-huh because since i'm an international student they want to send me back to Argentina well my dad wants me to go back so yeah and you don't want to no no no no because if you go back there then you can never get out oh like you don't have any money to to get out uh-huh so uh and uh i was thinking you know like oh my God you know i go back there and then and then i might get married there and then i will have kids there and then i'll never leave the place you know hum then you'll never leave yeah oh yeah i know and that's that's what happened to my brother he came to school up here and then when he went down there he was just so bad off you know from not being able to stay up here that oh uh-huh his life just went down the drain so well maybe something will open up for you yeah i i've been calling a lot of companies there some of them are interested well at least for a year and a half i can work so uh-huh well maybe well i've enjoyed talking to you okay bye-bye i'll do it all right same here bye-bye okay well uh i guess uh you're pretty aware that it's uh been uh a little warm for this time of year oh yeah it uh the humidity's a little higher it is this is muggy today like it wants to rain but it don't know what it wants to you know for this time of year uh-huh you know about a month from now this wouldn't be so bad but uh boy for the end of March this is uh this is funny no really bad yeah funny weather but bad because that means it either means one or two things it's going to be a bad summer or a not too good summer and a worse winter next year oh jeez well that's a good way to look at it i always do that i got to do something like that with the weather well if you do that then you'll only be pleasantly surprised probably if it's anything but that that's right that's uh that's uh but uh i i guess the winter the winter wasn't that bad down here really no see that's it was a mild winter that's why i keep saying oh no yeah looking looking forward to a really bad summer and hot summer yeah i think it's going to be really hot this year well hopefully you know if it's humid now maybe it'll i remember last year it rained an awful lot or uh you know for the last couple of years it's rained an awful lot and maybe that'll help to defeat some of the heat yeah um-hum and if uh if it rains a lot but uh but uh if it rains if it rains any more and gets really hot then we have this problem with mosquitoes oh yeah you're right yeah yeah i used to live in up north up in the upper midwest and uh see and we had had mosquito mosquito problems that's for sure well see i would prefer the cold i'm from southern California oh really but see the heat out here ain't nothing well you know it's it's that easy to say but boy when it's forty below and you're shoveling snow and it's forty below it's uh no i don't want to get that cold now it uh that's just the bad thing you either you either have to take the take this kind of weather or uh or take the really really cold weather i don't think no i don't want to go no where up north no where does it go in any any where north of the Red River huh-uh i don't even want to go anywhere yeah that's about it that's uh i that's what i've heard people say is they'll never go north of the Red River again that's right it's too cold up there um-hum and then last year that's when they really had that cold spell um-hum you know it was like um record breaking below temperatures and stuff in Alaska where your gas your car was freezing while it was running you know the gas oil or the gas would turn to slush huh-uh see i can't handle that yeah i i know what you mean because uh because you got to have like little oil heaters where they plug in the uh plug in uh your car um-hum yeah and uh that's not good that's not good at all and uh no something happens then what well i guess the only thing to do is to hope that this is the worse that it gets this year yeah it's not that bad right now i just hope it don't get any worse yeah or if it if it does get worse it doesn't stay for very long that's about it i'm just waiting because see it's tornado season oh that's right that's right because yes it is it's tornado season already already hit Oklahoma and probably right down here soon so um-hum you see this is this is tornado weather boy people don't know it but when it gets hot like this yeah and you know like they're predicting the weather to be cold well when it gets cold real fast um-hum um-hum get a northerner through here there's your tornados that's right and so they're predicting this weekend probably drop something like thirty degrees i say huh-uh see that ain't right that's right no no no it's uh but that's that's tornado season yeah and i guess i guess that's shows what they say about Dallas if you don't like the weather just just wait a day yeah it'll change on you wait a while it'll change that's right that's about like it is too because yesterday was really nice um-hum uh-huh and the wind was blowing but today is muggy but the wind is still blowing but you know i don't know the weather well anyway i guess that's about all i got to say about the uh the weather that's about it that's about all you can say about the weather okay talk about it but can't do anything about it uh okay that's right all righty thank you bye-bye all right bye-bye i kind of like mysteries like Agatha Christie and that kind of stuff oh Agatha Christie how about John D McDonald uh John D McDonald you ever read him no i'd actually i plead my ignorance knowledge lack of knowledge i'm not familiar with him what is he is he an American novelist oh yeah he's very he uh of course he he's dead now seems like most of the good ones are uh-huh yeah i know they don't write anything like they used to the classics but uh he he was he does quite involved mysteries John D McDonald and have you been reading him a long time or oh yes since well way back in high school that long we won't talk about that oh yeah yeah that's matter fact that's one of my favorite hobbies is uh reading yeah i'm that's one of mine my husband's a little more inclined toward that but i'm not real uh interested in self-improvement books at all i think everything's too topical nowadays yep for when i read i read for enjoyment or escapism and i yeah and i like a lot of things that are uh have to do with politics and uh history there was one a few years ago called the Public Palace about what goes on at the Pentagon oh yeah did you read are you do you interested in stuff like that or well i have i have i have been in the military so i'm well aware of the Public Palace yes oh okay then you probably know even more than i do yeah it it was quite it was quite amusing i used to i was in Viet Nam for a couple of years plus extension and i don't know have there been any good books books published on that i know World War two my dad was a uh paratrooper in airborne O hundred and one um but i don't think they have done anything good on Viet Nam and uh um-hum they've got several out uh there's one called Embassy House by uh Profit that's quite good i was involved with the Phoenix program and stuff of that that nature uh-huh and is it true i mean is it um it's fairly facts whoever he talked to knew what uh the had had been in the program uh it was probably factual he's kind of overdone a lot of it but um but you have to do that to make the books um-hum um-hum i i kind of one of my interests is um i've i'm interested in law and uh i just got a book for Christmas called Law and Order it's the history of the justice system and tracks um the the history of uh crimes and of um things that have impacted just the the you know evolution of um how we punish people and why things are um judged the way they are um i hadn't heard that one i hadn't uh got too heavy into law and order deal most of mine i'm afraid i go either mysteries or uh action adventure stuff oh action adventure i probably you're not talking your Danielle Steele female by any means but on the other hand i won't uh i can't Sidney Sheldon's does come off the shelf for light reading he's uh i read those uh actually i think my favorite author really right now is uh William Johnstone um-hum he writes the uh action series um-hum i've heard again i'm not familiar with reading him but i've heard of him he's got about twelve out now and it starts out with uh you know after the big war and everything's blown up and he then he's kind of a real positive yeah it's kind of it follows his his travels throughout the world there's one a book i just got i got it as a gift and i just started it's a little bit heavy but it was kind of interesting it um was on the best seller list for a while there it's called The Closing of the American Mind a little bit heavy about political philosophy oh yeah um-hum those i those i can read for a while but i got to stop and go you know walk around something that's kind of what's happened it kind of does happen yeah uh i'm trying to think of any self-improvement books i've read i've tried to do some of those but after after after after after i read them a while i thought maybe i don't need improvement that bad after all yeah that's exactly right it's kind of like all the talk shows i think i got to get they kind of drag on did you read that one uh let's see uh that the Arab guy wrote that the Abdul is going to come uh oh um no i didn't but i i i have it and i haven't read it yeah we got at TI to drive into town and almost buy it undercover at the time they were doing it that's exactly what happened to us we were living um in Minneapolis at the time and we were getting ready to come back to Texas um and i went i mean into a Waldon's and stood in line for like six hours it seemed like but i haven't read it there is a good one out though that we've had for a few years that i've actually read more than once it's called The Kingdom of Sound oh yeah okay and it is really really good about the um Saudis and just tracking their families and the Arabian culture i've read that i got uh i got the interested in when Saddam Hussein came to power i got interested in him and started reading some of his some of the books on him the man's it's well written actually and i think there're going to be more huh oh yes the man's just probably totally insane that's too bad that's not the topic i know self-improvement i think is the only one i got something like that when i got i'd been out of school for quite a while i think um back when it was again real topical um yeah uh women my age about then were maybe having trouble with parents or mothers and a friend of mine bought me something called My Mother and Myself and i tried to read it and i went this is i did the same thing i went this isn't anything have you read Tom Clancy uh yeah yeah in fact i just started her a friend a friend of ours turned me on to that i always i always looked at spy novels and i went eh military stuff just never really did anything to me unless it was history which one did you get the um China the red the the i think it was the right author you'll have to help me out here Hunt Hunt for Red October Hunt for Red October the one i went to see the movie for yeah yeah that was good uh he's got i was a little bit bored with it compared to some of the other stuff that i've heard he'd done he's uh that's one of the better ones uh i've got i think my favorite that he's done is is A Clear and Present Danger uh-huh yes that one i've we actually have that one my husband's read that it that one seems like it might be a little more interesting it's pretty factual he's got one out i'm trying to remember what it's called it has to do with with airplanes uh boy and i started in reading it a friend friend of mine whose a pilot gave it to me he said uh he said it's a wonderful book you'll love it i started reading it and he went of course he goes into such great detail uh-hu h that's what i i was impressed with how much documenting he does you know and i and it lost me how much how much um he's so much like Michener he's not as bad in terms of going into so much depth but he he's i like the way he writes and if it's not something that moves with me in the first two or three chapters something like that i just won't keep it you know i can't uh i can't stay with it too long either but that that i i read about fifty pages and then i just said i can't take it that's i just i can't keep all these buttons you know knobs and dials and gauges that are supposed to mean anything i don't want to i can't understand them and his action anecdotes weren't very good at all he he had he jumps around he in that particular book i don't know how his other ones are but in that one he jumped around a little bit um-hum in terms of subways and just just the general transition and i mean it i didn't you know i really you have to be interested in the subject too i think that was part of my problem yeah oh yeah it's there was just too much detail there for the for the neophyte anything to be real interesting yeah well it's good to talk to somebody i don't read as much as i used to um my husband's a TIer and i'm in journalism so i do a lot of writing um during the normal course of my job and it's kind of um sad when you find out the you know i thought i would get more toward reading and i'm getting less yeah it's well there's so many authors out now though of course i've got several favorites that i collect uh Eric Van Lustbader Lustbader any of all years um-hum he's got several out that i like and uh matter fact and what line does he write under what title does he he's got uh he's kind of um mystic oriental oh he has one called The Ninja uh-huh and then then Michael The Siren Black Heart then there's uh yeah i think uh i think you'll enjoy him oh that might be kind of interesting is it uh The Ninja is of course The Ninja and the Michael are you know one and two of the volumes and then he went off and wrote uh The Gem Zero and The French Kiss and several others and The White Ninja has just hit paperback i understand um-hum and does he uh in terms of their in terms of their practices and and their culture i mean does he document it or is it strictly oh yeah oh no he no he's he's heavy into Japanese culture oh okay he's heavy into Japanese culture uh along with uh the Ninja the arts of Ninja and all all the various uh martial arts does he tell it in narrative form or in third person how does he present it it's uh it fluctuates you kind of get flashbacks uh you get some flashbacks but you can really tell it's a flashback because the print goes to italic uh-huh and then you still get information too and then you get information too and it's kind of in a flashback and it it's told uh more or less third person singular and what's his name again Eric Van Lustbader Van Lustbader okay yeah spelled as you would expect yeah it it's you know Van and then Lustbader B A D E R Lustbader i'm going to write that one down yeah because he's he's very interesting i think i think you'll enjoy him looking for something different yeah it's you know you walk into a store and you just like you said you're overwhelmed by how much there is and you just i don't know if you're like me you you you're much more voracious in terms of how much reading you're doing obviously but i go in and i like yeah to me it's like being in a bakery but then i just don't find anything i like i pick up like eighteen things and then i'm not sure so i walk out do you like do you like kind of like the historical western or something of that nature uh no that's more no that's not i do actually i like Asian cultures that why i was that's funny that you mentioned that uh you'll then you'll like O'Leary he's he's he's quite good at it i've got into one that i didn't think i would it's a i'm not it's a kind of a historical Indian novel thing by Donald Colesmith um-hum um-hum called The Trail of the Spanish Bit and it's called The Spanish Bit Saga i thought that was uh do you like Michener at all yeah he's good did you ever read he wrote Texas a few years ago yeah i read that one uh-huh that was good and Poland yeah and i've done some of those yeah i like i like things that are those are a few of the ones i can take of his i like it when they actually are giving you information in a novel format i guess would be the you might try Colesmith try and find his uh Spanish Bit Saga it's called the it's called The Trail of the Spanish Bit is the first yeah by by Donald Colesmith he's a he's a Trail of the Spanish Bit okay yeah professor of of English in Emporia Kansas and uh he he's been a doctor and a gunsmith and um-hum oh my all kinds of stuff and uh he he writes it's history from the Indians point of view starting back when they first got the horse when they first captured the Spaniards um-hum and it just kind of follows forward and i got i got hooked on it and there's like about sixteen or eighteen do you believe in uh capital punishment you know you you're talking to probably one of the the sixties late sixties and early seventies original hippies now living in suburbia raising kids um uh-huh yeah i don't know i have a i have a real gut response that says nobody's got a you know a right to take anybody else's life on the other hand i have seen an awful lot of i've lived in major cities and i have kind of come to the conclusion that there are certain people that should just be shot yeah well i think uh that based on um certain crimes it uh is merited uh there was a case just recently i don't know if you uh if you heard about this in uh New Hampshire i believe about the uh teacher school teacher who hired her uh one of her high school students to kill her husband and they found her guilty and gave her life with no parole yes and in a case like that uh where well you've got a moral problem and an economic one uh yeah when when she's going to be in prison for the rest of her life with no chance of parole what good does it do anybody and the taxpayers are going to be footing the bill for the rest of her life she's a young young woman uh in her late twenties i guess so i just something like twenty two or twenty three i remember reading that and being horrified early twenties well i could be yeah uh had she had any previous criminal history now that's the of thing i'd have to kind of look at um i don't know i didn't hear that much about it uh just the uh the verdict that they had in Texas if you're going to sentence somebody to uh to death what is is there a specific criteria that they have to meet um i don't i don't really know about that uh uh if well uh i think i think it's it's only it only applies to certain a very few types of crimes uh murder and i think kidnapping could carry death penalty as well i'm not sure what how what the range is for uh for the crimes that uh would merit a death penalty um if you were on a jury would would you be able to to give somebody a death sentence uh i think it depends on what what it was they did and if the evidence was uh uh if there was no doubt in my mind that that person was guilty of that crime um-hum and if they were uh if if if i had no doubt that uh they would be a hazard to to the rest of uh the population as long as they were alive uh yeah i could probably go along with that how about if it was uh a seventeen and a half year old with a a list and all uh of what do they call it uh criminal as long as your armed over the history of a violent crime well i guess you've got a choice either you do life in prison or you can institutionalize somebody forever uh where they're not a threat to to the rest of uh the population or or you can put them out of everybody's misery uh i don't know it's it's a real moral dilemma yeah i mean i come from the Catholic church and they they uh are definitely opposed yeah see i come from a Catholic church background too to that type of um-hum and always thought you know that being raised in the midwest you really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than uh shoplifting right yeah and it was very easy to maintain this stand that you know that that life is something that you have no right to to take when you see all the people who are convicted of these crimes and they get out of prison after a few years all of the sudden here they're they're uh committing the same type of crimes all over again other people are victimized what do you do about it i don't know you know there was a oh what was his Gary Gilmore did you ever read the book that Norman Mailer wrote The Executioners Song no i never did Gary Gilmore was the one who was arrested and uh found guilty of i think two or three murders in Utah Provo outside of Provo and he was the one that was petitioning to have have you know himself executed uh-huh okay when you read his book with all the interviews this guy did with Gary Gilmore you know it sounds like the guy had about every turn given to him every rehab opportunity given to him and even interviews with his mother she said that you know for for as a small child he's basically was amoral right and when i finished that book i kind of thought you know what do you how do with a person like this well some people just are incorrigible and there's no way that they can ever deal with society and abide by rules so in in a case like that uh given what crime they're guilty of uh yeah i could i could justify a death penalty for somebody who just has no chance of ever reforming or coming to grips with uh living in normal society see i would i always come look at it do they have could they be put even in life imprisonment could they be put to useful labor um yeah i believe so could they do road work and those kind of things and now and then you get somebody like Charles Manson who just even hasn't a guy around well people who tend to be say on death row they i think they're kept in isolation all the time i don't believe that they're given a chance to uh do anything productive or even uh mix with the rest of the prison community and then what do you do about the the thing that you know the the the was it one tenth of one percent chance that they might have been convicted erroneously right well it's it's it's real small but uh like i said i mean the death penalty could probably be justified if if the evidence if there's no doubt no i never have have you ever sat on a jury either have i and i'm one of these people who votes regularly and i'm always registered wherever i've lived and i have never been called i know several people at work who've been called on juries and they absolutely hate it part of me says that i'd kind of like to do it just to see what it's like to be in that position where you are playing you know life and death with somebody else could i bring myself to do it well so much of it is game playing with the lawyers they're plea doing their plea bargaining and and uh give and take type situation that uh they're playing with people's lives in effect uh by offering uh to uh uh offering to announce their guilt to a certain degree on a crime in order to get uh a lighter uh sentence sentence yeah have you ever lived in a in a well but Dallas is i'm is are you calling from Dallas uh yeah i'm in that area uh-huh okay have have you ever been a victim of a crime uh yes i have uh automobile uh vandalism you know when we lived in Boston i had eleven cars stolen my gosh yeah some of them i had for two days and you'd go to court and you'd see these kids and then and yeah what they did is they usually hired kids to do this because you uh would get a you know a lighter sentence or no sentence or probation or you know something trivial and it'd be the same damn kids right sure over and over and over again and the first couple of times you know i felt really sorry for them but after a while it was like you know shoot the little shits right then and there then i felt really you know guilty about feeling that way yeah yeah i'd i don't have much sympathy for people that are uh uh victimizing others on a regular basis you know if it's a one time offense and and the kid learns his lesson and uh shows remorse and promises never to do something again and they take some steps to educate him in the matter uh it's it's one thing but when they're there over and over again and uh guilty of the same crimes uh nothing seems to help yeah yeah i you know i really don't know what what i would do in that situation if i had to to make that judgment i think i would i think i'd be very easily swayed by fellow jurors uh yeah well i think it depends on what the crime is uh you're not going to sentence somebody to death for stealing a car uh if it's first degree murder or uh boy if they ever catch this guy in in Richardson and Coppell who's been uh you know abducting the the young girls i don't think i'd even hesitate right no something like that is just uh unforgivable and then you get you know what do you do with you know people that are you know chronic child molesters yeah well i don't know where even a psychiatrist says you're proba bly not going to change them they're always going to be you know at risk in society and and and i think you know having kids has probably really right changed you know my thinking on this i don't know i really don't know yeah i think people like that when they do get put in prison with the other hard core prisoners uh the child molesters in particular are not looked on kindly by the other prisoners they don't get a lot of respect and they they probably tend not to even survive in that uh type of environment because even in prison they have their code of ethics i guess if you can call it that yeah but the code of ethics that's learned in prison is so so bent and twisted that you wonder when they get out of there even if they you know claim that they're are rehabbed sure well yeah they don't have any really useful job skills uh lots of places no they don't even have social skills oh i don't know i really don't know i i think that if somebody asked me i would hesitantly say yes that i could could hand down a death sentence um-hum uh then the big you know my big problem would be is what if you were in a in a state that absolutely did not allow it well and you were on a jury with some heinous you know criminal who had you know just wiped out an entire family right you've got life without parole something like that or parole in in uh fifteen twenty years sure well case like Charles Manson he's uh he's been eligible for parole a couple of times already his case comes up every few years now i guess and uh people have to uh stand up and uh denounce him again and claim that he's not fit for society but we're that close to letting people like that out of prison so i guess a good question to ask is do you do your own work or do you do you like to do it yeah well i um about a or just over a year ago i bought my my own house so this has been the first opportunity i've had to uh be working on my own lawn and garden and uh you know back when i was a kid you know mom would send me out to weed the garden i i'd hate it you know now i sort of take pride in uh in the yard and you know how the how the place looks and uh so i don't mind doing it so much anymore yeah yeah so do you have a do you have a garden or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn well it's yeah it's it's primarily just uh like landscaping a little bit you know i've got some uh bushes around the foundation you know the foundation planting things like that and then there's some uh uh just some little flowerbeds and my mom grows she's an avid gardener and she starts her own stuff from seed now and uh she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the winter time and and starting them uh she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden they have a huge yard and a huge house and so she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras well that's pretty good my my sister is very over zealous too she's got yeah some really nice flowerbeds she puts a lot of time into them this is my first year in a in a house where i thinking about doing some flowerbeds and stuff oh we i've always had crude ones at my father's but this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house his house is more like a farmhouse its not on a main road yeah uh-huh my house is on a main road and it has nothing i mean nothing but uh what i do do is now i've always done it at my father's house yeah we have my sister and i have a couple of gardens i think we figured out total um this is for vegetables about two thirds of an acre so we each have a third of an acre we do uh-huh geez that's a that's more than that's a lot that's more than than the property i have right here that you've got as a uh a garden that's amazing yeah well it's my dad's and we've had it for over he's been there for a long time so right um it just happens they built a shopping center next to it but um they put up a nice fence so we still have a lot of privacy oh geez and we grow a lot of food uh-huh uh i enjoy it um the gardens are kind of old you have to step down in them now that the uh-huh and we've tilled them so much but they're still we we my sister uses plenty of fertilizer i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing boy i wish this phone would stop screeching are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line yes i'm trying i don't know if it's my phone this is bad it's not getting any better yeah i can't even hear what you're oh okay geez it's gone i don't see i don't think my phone really does that but every time i have this phone is a little weird i mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times well i i don't know there was well whatever it was there was a second there i couldn't even hear what you were saying but um yeah i was beating on the phone going can you hear me so yeah i guess i was having a hard time there too i thought it sounded well guess we better stick to the subject for the benefit of the people uh uh doing this work but um yeah yeah i mean that's a uh heck of a plot you must have uh a lot of different stuff you get out of it especially up in Vermont there you should have uh some really nice soil yeah we we grow a lot of um the basic corn corn potatoes uh-huh she likes to really get into her pumpkins and see how many she can grow basic corn potatoes and uh acorn squash are good winter keepers yeah i mean things the way we grow are carrots and uh cabbage that sort of more less goes to waste you know we eat it we just too much she she starts her own plants she plants a lot of tomatoes um-hum uh-huh i let her do a lot of the planting and putting and i i do a lot of the uh a lot of the the back the back work and stuff but she does she helps me a lot too she puts a lot of financial she plans it all out uh-huh beans like to be near certain types of plants now they they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like uh peas i don't know something oh really is because of like the cross pollination or no it's just like something like an onion and a tomato would go together but you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans i guess it's it it's just what scents it gives off they just don't like each other huh i mean she she reads all kinds of books so i wish i knew more to tell you why but what huh my mom uh put uh cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once and they got cross pollinated by the bees they yeah and we ended up with these these like things on the cantaloupe vines that i mean were looked like round big huge round cucumbers oh that's really weird and and yeah i mean there these were like some mutant i will put i've put my uh cucumbers are down at one end of the garden and like like i'll make an L shape i've put cantaloupe so they've been pretty close together huh but i don't think the vines they don't really they don't have to be touching or anything like you say they cross pollinate just by bees no it's just the like the bees and insects will do it oh um either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something i know some something weird yeah this year we didn't this last season it was it was too wet up here uh-huh we lost a lot of oh uh root things our oh uh our squash and our potatoes and we got half our yield it was really bad because of the water oh well yeah when i uh my family used to live in Littleton Massachusetts and when we moved in there we had a uh really wet backyard and uh my mom wanted a vegetable garden so we trucked in uh i think it was seven what was it cubic seven yards cubic yards i think that's how they measure dirt but yeah yeah yeah seven yards of sand i got to shovel it all yeah i i have to do that i want to make some flowerbeds and i'm going to have a seven yard truck come in lots of fun with some topsoil uh-huh and i'm going to a my problem is i want to use those railroad ties to build up a planter but i don't know if the creosote in the railroad ties is going to do something sure to uh you know if i want to grow a tomato or something in there i i mean i guess it'd go for my flowers but right well it seems i've seen a lot of people use them you know for flowerbeds but i don't know what whether they'd have creosote would do anything i mean yeah i don't i don't i just don't think you i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird but i don't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering um-hum and i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated well you can get um you can get pressurized lumber yeah but they put some kind of oh that's right there's even there's bad chemicals in those too chemicals in there too yeah well i'm not really worried about it it's mainly for flower bed so i'm not going to not going i'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there alright but i yeah i do want to have a raised bed i've never i my flower gardens have always been like on the ground right they don't it just looks so much better when it's up against the house tiered up well not that you can see it a little better and it stands out yeah this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch and i can tell you there's nothing around it cement foundation all the way round it not a shrub not a bush there was a lilac tree and the landlord cut it down and said yep that's one thing you have to do summer keep that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding and i'm looking at him like jeez people would kill to have a lilac bush oh geez yeah and he's cutting it down so that's all right flower beds are all right anything as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding rub up against the siding uh yep that's what he's worried about the trees or a bush because lilac bushes they they grow fast some people uh would really like to have them and then the people that do have them they spread and they sprout all over their their lawn um-hum so they're kind of a pain but you know people who don't have them think they're great and people who do have them right curse curse right another thing i have that um is weird is these a locus tree in the backyard as a matter of fact there's three of them very badly trimmed they aren't trimmed at all uh-huh and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back which we said we'd do if the trees hang down so low and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it so yeah because it like i i think i've seen those before but i don't remember what they look like they're a pretty tree but you just when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns so we're going to get a chain saw and we're going to limb limb it extensively so it the trees up overhead so it'll give you room to get under it sure yeah because i can just see brushing up against it that it would rip your skin it's worse than a rose a rose bush yeah hm many times worse because of course it's a tree oh a chainsaw is always something very nice to have yep my uh dad used to work on them so i don't think i'll have a problem my husband will have problem borrowing one even then you got to get him to if he's going to do it you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it well if that's not the problem it okay what okay opinion do you have about what was what happened well it's it's a real mixed um feeling about it uh it's really good that we did well and that uh um-hum we we went in and did what we set out to do i i have there's there's been like a lot of things said about if it was a political well if it was a war for oil or a a war for ideals and seems to be real mixed between those two things um-hum um i don't know i think the the the guy should have been ousted out of there and now we don't seem to be as interested in in doing what's right um-hum um-hum as we were when we started the whole thing yeah see i feel like i don't know i feel like the motivation Bush is a member of the Trilateral Commission and he's a member he was a member of the Skull and Bones at i think at Princeton or Yale i'm not Yale Yale yeah and uh his motivations are i don't feel like he was absolutely on the up and up with us on you know the motivation the true motivation he talks a lot about the new world order right and most Americans probably don't really know what that would mean and i maybe i'm being maybe i'm assuming too much no i don't think most would i really don't and so i feel like the real motivation was something that uh most people would have absolutely no idea and that that motivation is to um you know to establish a one world order and to break up the monopoly power of the Middle East will so that they will submit under the uh one world order i mean that's what i felt so i'm like going hum am i glad we went over there and did that um i think God's ultimately in charge and right you know i'm not afraid of what they've done i'm not afraid of Saddam Hussein i feel he's lost and you know he needs to get saved just like the everybody else but right you know i just i guess i have kind of like hum kind of real cautious in the whole thing because i know that there's a motive that hasn't been openly discussed or revealed to anybody and uh that's where that's why i really don't have a real right set opinion because i don't know everything i don't much you could watch news all the time but you don't know anything hardly and he did talk about that though he did uh at least he did mention it right you know what i'm saying i don't think most people understand what he's talking about when he talks about that new world order so i don't know what do you think of that it's it's it's a whole monopoly that needs to be broken up that's for sure it doesn't it's they have far too much influence over there and they're so unstable that it makes it hard for um it it makes it hard for us to deal with them i have that same problem at work um-hum our our plant is so unstable it makes it very difficult to laughter to plan ahead or or do anything that that's uh-huh productive uh-huh yeah and i can understand why he he felt he needed to go over there on the other hand it's too bad that he couldn't use this i i i know that oil's real important to our life style but it's too bad he couldn't use this as um-hum um-hum a launch to say let's conserve more because he never said that um-hum uh-huh during the whole war he never put out like a conservation a conservation effort for oil um-hum but the motivation though see wasn't didn't have anything i don't believe it had anything to do with the oil because i think i i feel like the real the real motivation of the war was to break up that Arab power not to disperse the oil but to they were a big problem for the the unifying of the EEC the European Economic Community which are gonna become i i i mean they're gonna be um-hum they're gonna put us under if we don't become part of the new world order next year the United States if we don't i mean we're going to be in big trouble because when Europe unites unites that's why TI's building plants in Italy because they're going to have power like we can't imagine right and so the i think Bush wanted to break up this other power thing and it looks real good but in the end i just see that ultimately who's going to be in charge of this one world order you know what i mean is is George Bush really any better than Saddam Hussein or does he just look better do you know what i'm saying i mean i think one person right in power that's not really seeking God and wanting to do good for the people and not deal for selfish motives is very dangerous and i don't see that this one world this new world order that him and Gorbachev keep talking about i just don't see that um that's just a real good thing but i think it's something that's going to happen but i guess that's what i feel happen with the war and that was the motive of the war was to try and break that up and so that they could be you know get more power over that Arab lands when they try and next year really start pushing this new world order well he talks about it all the time i mean right i mean that's all he talks about but anyway there's a good book by Larry Abraham um you probably have heard of None Dare Call It Treason and Call it Conspiracy right well anyway Call it Conspiracy is a real good book and he talks a lot about this i've heard him interviewed some so i think it's kind of interesting but anyway he probably has a new book out that i don't know about yet because i haven't heard him in a while but i don't know so that's kind of my thing on the war i'm kind of like nah it's all power plays you know there's so much stuff going on we don't know about oh yeah it's you know i'm like going hey Peter Jennings you know he knows a little bit but he doesn't even i mean we would all die if we knew what was really going on i mean all of America would probably go into coronary attack well they would yeah i know i agree oh my money's in the stock market oh i can't believe they're doing this but it doesn't change anything so i'm just like i don't know just i mean i would probably most people probably think i don't even have a high school education you know because of my attitude about it but i just feel like there's so much going on that you know hey i'm going to pray about it and if i feel led to vote for a certain person i'm going to do it but i'm not going to get all up tight about all this and stuff you know hum-um because i know at first we were watching the news a lot and man it was like gosh we were like all the time and i thought gee you know God's going to protect Israel i mean he starts well you can't yeah he starts nuking Israel man he's in big trouble i mean we'll just we'll hear about it you know what i mean if anything major happens we're going to find out so let's chill out and just do what we need to do so yeah that's where i got to too the first i got chills up and down when i heard the on the radio and the first time they started doing the bombing um-hum i know it was kind of exciting at first but and then i know the first night of the bombing we had it was a Wednesday and we had home church and we had a surprise birthday party planned for a sixteen year old yeah exactly and so when we you know we're on the way to home church and the bombing's just begun you know and we go into this birthday party for a surprise party oh and so it was you know we just went from one extreme to the other you know and it was like kind of sad it was like man this is really hard you know i want to watch the war and so and so imagine the sixteen year old yep boy i had a surprise birthday party and a war started in Israel that'll be a good story when she's thirty won't it right it will be well well anyway well i guess do you think we're finished i guess so i think so too i don't know if we did what we were supposed to but yeah we did they can do a lot of research we get along good too some of the callers you don't along with that good you know you have you know what i'm saying yeah we talked yeah isn't that funny i bet they're going to do a lot of research on that oh yeah well yeah one one guy i talked to about about colleges he was very opinionated and i know uh-huh it was difficult really he probably had those glasses on like you know those Annie Hall kind of glasses i don't know what you call it John Lennon glasses that's what they are the women i call Annie Hall glasses but yeah real thick yeah is i don't know if they're Annie Hall glasses or not i just i don't know i always think of Annie Hall when i see them but yeah i think they're versions of that really i know the female version of John Lennon's but yeah yeah i know i talked to some guy who was i talked to some of the yuppie types you know and they're pretty interesting but yeah they're real opinionated but i guess that's better than nothing you know yeah yeah but anyway yeah it's been interesting though all these different people and some of them are real friendly you know and it's like yeah man when i come to Dallas i'll call you you know and then others of them are like they just wanna go but then some of them have babies crying in the background too so there may be other reason than you know that but well anyway are you in Dallas right yeah i'm in Dallas i didn't know that people from other parts of the country were doing this yeah i had a guy from Rhode Island that we talked about fishing so and uh oh i had some i've had people in Massachusetts and Vermont they work at TI up there do you work at TI no my husband does see mine does too in Dallas and um yeah but no there's there's TI's up in Rhode Island and stuff and that guy talked about fishing and i asked him if he took his wife and yeah and then he didn't have a wife and i felt bad but well i'm sorry and he goes we're divorced well i'm sorry it was real sad but he was pretty nice and stuff and then him and my husband started talking salary oh no how much do you make up in Rhode Island so i was just going wait a minute we're supposed to be talking about fishing now stop but yep anyway is that funny but we did talk about fishing though so but i guess i'll let you go i'm going to finish my dishes and if anything happens interesting in the war maybe they'll have another thing and we'll get you again all right bye okay all right thanks bye-bye okay well like i was saying Burlington's crime it doesn't involve children and what you see on the TV's from you know in Washington and New York so what i believe the people want the subject is is big city crime which is something that i don't have any first hand experiences about but i have you know concerns and i have a few ideas of um um-hum how to combat it i mean i don't i don't think uh ideally you know you need money to do everything so that's one thing that um-hum that's one thing that that's that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money so right yeah well when uh we lived in San Antonio i grew up around San Antonio and it's always been a very large uh city and increasingly growing it's has kind of the split population um there's a lot of retired military uh individuals that live there and then there's a very large Hispanic population there and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is Hispanic uh gang crime in the city and that is uh been the worse thing that we've seen happening uh oh does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the more the uh retired people's community or does it stay in the bad neighborhood um the majority of the actual gang crimes like the the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies rape and uh car crime there's a very large uh or very high percentage of car theft and San Antonio San Antonio's not far from the border to Mexico so a a lot of the uh cars go to uh you know hack shops and they take them apart and a lot of them go over the border especially like Mercedes a lot of those those in the the Z uh the Z cars the Datsun cars end up over the border and uh so that's a big concern if you live there is to really lock your car up very much so very much so in fact um for a while there uh they had downtown if you were to come come to a stop light they had a a rash of where people were uh when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up so now ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car until they get down there and once you've reached the the river walk area which is the tourist area it's usually pretty safe during the during the day if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys and um you know or or alone if you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the the river patrol cops it's very nice but at at evening um again you they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice but you don't want to get off the beaten track um there's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight and so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage um alone oh my it sounds like um San Juan Puerto Rico we were there just well for a lay over and um well it wasn't a lay over we were we had um-hum we were we had we were staying at the other end of the island and we drove into San Juan to catch our plane it was at night and this boy really wanted to go on the beach and they look at you crazy you don't go on the beach well it's a big tourist town um-hum um-hum you know don't they don't people go for a walk on the beach at night and they said no it's very safe in the daytime but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk um-hum um-hum and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary you know and get off the beach it's just so sad you know it is just really so sad you know it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more um in San Antonio i don't know what the answer is uh education i think is a lot of it um so many of the kids are are drop outs um uh there's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives they they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels i think education helps a little bit there um they again i don't know really what steps there are that they well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young and what we have here in Burlington which uh-huh it doesn't cost a lot of money but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids they set up uh-huh uh-huh kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow they have a big brother big sister program they have bottle drives they have cleanup outings uh and they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer and they have gyms open and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs uh-huh after school you might keep them but you again you need that one on one uh-huh like a big brother trying to keep the younger kid you know tell him hey stay in school it'll get better you know so that your mom doesn't have a job and uh-huh she doesn't work you don't know you can be better than that You don't have to live on the you know for a street life uh-huh that's good that sounds like they've got a lot going on there but yeah but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here i mean um they can deal with that scale uh-huh they might have five hundred troubled youths when you have five thousand troubled youths plus when you're getting into the well the kids now it's twelve years old and they're uh-huh selling drugs and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh it's just it's the morals of the people which i mean i guess we everybody's responsible for the society but if i had a child that that did things so bad it's not they don't care about anybody these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy uh-huh uh-huh and we don't have it so we deserve it and we should take it uh-huh yeah i don't know how you combat that i i don't know where you start or with a lot of these kids um so many of them all they see is just the gangs and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school yeah well i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too we're talking these kids are fourteen years old The parents might be thirty years old oh yeah uh-huh and i'm thirty years old and i'm kind of irresponsible but i have the morals that keep me from you know if i was going to go out and drink or do something i wouldn't do it in front of my child these people you know they bring their their Johns home and they bring their drugs home and the kids are just sitting there in the same room uh-huh it's just that they have absolutely no no morals and it's really sad uh-huh and i don't know how you combat that i really i don't know what the answer is to that problem you know but i like your idea of education i mean if the parents aren't supplying it they've got to get it from someone else from the schools uh-huh uh-huh yeah and what do those kids do they get it at school and come home what do they do then i i feel i feel for them i don't know how to make it better for them or you know unless because it they can't remove themselves they can't just leave and say okay well it's not acceptable i'm leaving the big city mom and i'm i'm going off you know when they're ten they have to live in it and yeah it's really sad like if they did have a big brother big sister program those those people trying to help the kids the parents might have hostilities towards them uh-huh right i think so and uh you know like you're judging us and i'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true uh-huh it it it's i'm glad i don't live in a big city uh-huh yeah just because i mean not just because i wouldn't feel safe it's just because that i would be reminded every day of something that i don't see and i might see it on a you know a Sixty Minute special yeah uh-huh no in San Antonio it was like every day it was just a matter of who was shot that night i know it but San Antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not i mean they have all kinds of nice write ups about it uh-huh oh yeah but but any big city has a bad section but there's a lot of them it's very prevalent a lot of the crime is very prevalent yes they're very bold it seems uh-huh very much When we moved here to Monterrey it was a big change because it's such a small community we're just above Carmel and um there's hardly most everybody seems pretty well employed around here and um those that aren't there's Celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers and there's a lot of crime there um migrant Hispanic farm workers people that are down and out and uh they all seem to congregate in Celinas not so much here in Monterrey so it's it's pretty quiet you know we walk the streets at night and uh people run in the park and you know you're just have your normal smarts about you then you really don't have to worry or really even uh even in the worst crime areas in Burlington i i can walk the streets i wouldn't i if i did it every night uh-huh i think there would be trouble in our house so you wouldn't get confronted or anything right but i don't think you would uh someone might grab you mess around with you but they're not going to grab you steal your your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities uh-huh yeah i mean that's what you your going to have to expect that to happen people are just totally unfeeling like uh uh-huh oh uh-huh uh i didn't know that about Burlington i'll have to keep that in mind anyway uh uh do you work for a large corporation corporation well i did uh and i'm currently uh consulting now so i'm with this you know a smaller organization um so my benefits are uh-huh pretty basic uh medical um i don't get any profit sharing and stuff like that so i uh i work with a medium size company and we don't have profit sharing but i would enjoy it since we uh it's a service based organization so yeah it would be nice but yeah what uh the current climate is i saw a little flyer and uh i thought it was interesting uh is they are now offering you know flex flexible benefits where you have more control and allocate uh like you can uh pay for uh vacation time if you want to take more vacation you can just buy them out or something like that so i can can do other things and uh that would be nice they actually have a software package that sounds like where you can manipulate different things to see what it costs to you for those benefits so it sounds like they're going to get very more flexible to meet individual needs which i think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite a few different objectives well people with families have different objectives than single people or no no i've got a family two children yeah are you single okay uh yeah alright do you have children are you single but no i i'm uh single i'm uh never been married so you are i no i said i've never been married i'm only i'm only twenty six so oh you never have oh yeah that's there's still a lot of time for that i had already been married and had one child by that time but um i still got a few years we uh we've we just kind of started young in life but uh uh we uh my husband's still with the same company for ten years and as a result and it has worked out so he's got a real nice benefit package but um it's uh it's nice to be with a big company for that reason i guess so what are the most important benefits to you oh the hospitalization um is the hospitalization medical care benefits is what we like the best um because it's a good well rounded program it's you know just eighty percent and then uh the deductible's reasonable i think it's three fifty a year for the family uh-huh whereas with my company they pay fifty percent and the deductible's i think five hundred a year and it costs a lot more i'm with a smaller company though the but the medical stuff itself uh so the health plan you're with it only it only covers fifty percent that's right ouch that's the worst i've ever heard yeah it's not very good it's usually the eighty basic eighty twenty yeah besides your initial deductible that's what varies the most i guess uh yeah yeah or you can go with a HMO you know Health Maintenance Organization where you pay a certain amount a month ha um and then five dollars every time that you go in or two dollars everytime yeah co-payments that's what they are yeah co-payments type stuff yeah well i think uh obviously i think the the medical is the most expensive or it's the most important um-hum uh coverage uh of the you know you may not even go in to the doctor for a long time but you know if something came up obviously you you know to get covered is important um-hum um well if we one of our children is just is just turned two and her first eighteen months of life God well she had one operation she's been to the emergency room a couple of times i mean she's she's just expensive the other one wasn't nearly that expensive but the but the baby just one of those yeah kind of sickly kids that has a lot of accidents uh-huh how about any matching programs you ever you know what i mean where they contribute contribute contribute like a hundred percent of up to four percent of you salary into a 401K no oh yeah yeah my husband's got that available that's great is it is it a hundred percent or is it fifty percent i think it's fifty percent up to four percent or maybe it's fifty percent up to eighty percent okay yeah i'm not exactly sure but that that's a nice i think that's an important benefit yeah that's great uh i don't get that option i i i was at a company that had that and i didn't make enough to to be able to put anything in it so i had to leave so yeah it's nice we uh we we do a lot of our savings in that manner and then the rest of it through a universal life policy which is but uh money that you can touch but it's tax deferred and yields a higher rate in general than what we can get in CD's and gets life it's a it's a term life policy also uh-huh with an annuity yeah yeah yeah that's what it is you know about insurance i didn't know anything about insurance until i had got until i had children yeah i i the only reason i know a little bit about that is when i was in school still uh-huh i was down in Florida working and uh during during the summer some how i got a hold of involved in a a marketing organization that marketed uh replacing those uh whole life policies which aren't very good insurance policies people are losing you know and it losing money or not doing as well as they could really and uh the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with annuity an annuity and uh uh-huh they would uh you know analyze it the person's current policy and get a computerized computerized you know statement of uh what would happen you know at this age this age this age you know uh what your benefits would be and uh the difference between you know the term life with annuity and the whole life uh-huh was you know there's fairly big discrepancies discrepancies you know so they could try to replace those so i got involved uh on that end and picked it up but i never did tell anyone back at school and i never i never uh did anything with it but uh so i know a little about uh the right now i just do a little basic life thing on my benefits but you know i don't know what i get out maybe twenty thousands or something just to cover me and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out that i know you know some family that but uh i'm not worried about that i don't have anybody to to until you get your dependents it just doesn't matter yeah well i like the idea of having that chunk of money uh to help anybody cover my end you know you don't want to be a burden to anybody else uh yeah right right and uh but as far as being able to really leave anything so i think yeah i mean i'm not looking to to leave anything there may be a a certain amount and you know that's fine but uh uh you know to get that coverage and know that i'll get you know uh you know flown to wherever i need you know already i need to go i guess i haven't made any decisions like that i guess you know my family and father would do that but uh are your family see i've i've kind of moved around from my home originally and um and my family's out in Florida now most of my family and i'm out here in Phoenix so oh but uh anyway as far as benefits um what else is important important uh obviously i think uh a profit sharing is is uh is uh is a important benefit especially in the long run for the long term i've never yeah um i've my husband's company does a little bit of profit sharing but my company doesn't and i'd really like it if my company did they turn quite a profit at times but it's not part of uh what's available so yeah smaller the the companies it's either the smaller company you you you're in to into the consulting side and they'll you'll finish up a project and you'll get the little bonus that type of thing um-hum um-hum um i guess you could technically consider that profit sharing um but um most you know most medium or small probably don't do that much profit sharing and while i was at this other corporation they never had any profit so it didn't help any to share yeah they couldn't share any and i guess they had a little bit one year but yeah i wasn't qualified qualified for my first year something you know after yeah so so have you have you been just been out of school what i guess four years yeah little over three years now yeah at uh it uh quite a different world isn't it versus being life before real world life in college versus what okay did you vote in the last uh national election yes we uh uh i haven't missed a one since i've been eligible to vote oh that's good uh did you get to vote at the last one i voted in the last national one yeah i'm not sure if i got the last local one oh uh-huh yeah and sometimes the the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that uh they should be yeah and you're not sure where to go and vote and all that right and uh there's usually nobody running against you know the incumbents right or you don't know what they stand you know where they stand or anything like that right so uh but i i feel that uh a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting yeah i think you're right and it's it's they're and also they're fed up with the system and they say well why should i even vote yeah or sometimes they don't like either of the choices right for the candidates so they think well you know why vote right the lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it oh i know it the last gubernatorial race was oh that was awful yeah really especially in Texas it really was yeah it was a mess but uh so i don't know i it'll be interesting to see how the next uh few years go yeah um did you think it's a serious problem that half the people don't vote or yeah i think well it's it's definitely a problem and i think it could get worse yeah you know we get this lackadaisical attitude and say huh you know why should we vote and then uh you know it could uh it could lead to some serious things yeah it also seems like maybe another another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting um-hum right uh yeah we can get uh you know if we get someone in there like that then you know they could make all sorts of changes if they were you know had enough pull yeah it's kind of like in Louisiana where that uh guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected kind of scary when you think about that yes um-hum yeah and uh who's the other guy LaRouche uh LaRouche LaRouche uh that uh is sort of the uh socialist not socialist but communist uh he's so off the wall that uh he's gone in and tried to get into city elections and uh but he's got he's been put away for uh credit card fraud i believe oh gosh yeah Lyndon LaRouche that's it yeah and uh so yeah yeah people'll will sit home and assume oh that guy would never get elected next thing you know you've got him um-hum right if you don't go and vote then you know very good chance that they they will because a lot of the people like that yeah they'll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say well you know this guy's got everything together you know i like what he says you know it'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him right yeah and uh you know i think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because because uh the guy did get elected correct that's what i thought yeah i think so right yeah he sure did and uh so you know it uh but you know they can always fool us you know they might do a good job yeah i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or um-hum something like if you have if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long i think that discourages a lot of people oh yeah what we do usually is uh vote uh absenteeism uh-huh and uh i know here you know you don't have to have any reason you can just go and vote right and uh the polls are open what was it a couple of weeks uh the hours are good and it they're even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays uh-huh and so you we've got plenty of time to go uh because uh down here in in Houston it's uh the lines are long yeah i'm in Dallas and they're long here too so so uh but uh yeah i voted absentee one year i really was going to be gone so i i did it but uh it was nice i would be tempted to do it again uh-huh well uh i recommend it because you just walk right on in and there's usually not anybody in line right and uh you know that vote's just as good as you know the one on election day yeah i think they should change the whole system so that it's easier i think i think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle um-hum yeah um i've yeah i've been involved with uh some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the of the Republican party and it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the uh how the uh uh-huh the not the ballots but uh my mind has gone blank i've been wrestling with a child all evening uh what uh how they develop uh what the candidate stands for the you know the views and uh uh-huh you know everybody gets to vote on you know well should he be for this and uh you know on and on and on and uh it's it's interesting yeah that would be i usually vote a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out what every but you know other than the major candidates what they stand for on on what issues so i just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so i'll go ahead and vote huh um-hum uh right and uh there for a while that would that works we've uh but that i i know i have uh i'll stick to uh to uh you know sometimes i'll stick to a certain party depends on the guy uh-huh but uh if it uh gets down between two then i'll i'll vote for the party if i know you know something about the other guy or you know they're both just as bad then i'll say well yeah i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party and um but yeah you know that's not uh the best way but no i guess it'd be best if you knew what each person and what they stood for and why and everything but right right but it gets to the point where i mean you've got to have the time find the time also to read read about the guy and and be able to find the information about what he stands for right and try to determine if what you read was objective or not and right or what you've heard on TV which i think is just outrageous i i don't agree with how the uh media handles elections yeah yeah i you know i'm i'm tired of hearing about the polls you know you know this is how he stands such and such a day yeah they break it out it's just it's just ridiculous yeah i think it could affect the outcome you know could make it unfair um-hum it really could and uh uh then how sometimes how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an an issue into the ground which is good and dead and they keep dragging it on and it could hamper the uh outcome of an election for the guy that should have won oh yeah yeah so uh yeah the press has a lot of power they really do i i sometimes think that that should be limited more yeah oh but boy you try get into that you'd really open a can of worms oh yes or they uh you know i i agree with the freedom of of the press and that's you know all the amendments but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things yeah seems like they should regulate themselves a little bit and i don't think they ever care to no they don't well i can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting and well i enjoyed talking to you to talk about well it was good talking to you um bye all right thank you bye-bye okay well budgeting is a sore subject in this family yeah me too i know exactly what you mean we've actually uh uh tried uh budgeting is very important to us we we try it every month and um i think it's good i mean it it gives us a sense of uh uh of of staying in some semblance of control but uh we we do have uh we never seem to be able to stick with it no it's really hard to do that i mean it's i don't know i guess um we do kind of have a budget um but it's kind of funny what we what we do i guess is we try to proportion uh who pays what according to the salary that we make uh do you not understand what i'm saying we we pay a percentage no um which is kind of strange a lot of people don't do that but hey we find that it works you know now i'm sorry what is what is this again well okay um like i pay a certain percentage of my pay check to the bills and he pays a certain percentage of his paycheck do you understand okay i guess i didn't really explain that too well oh okay oh i see oh sure yeah okay yeah yeah that makes perfect sense yeah well yeah uh we ours is actually very detailed um we we've got categories for everything and uh we we figure out how much income the both of us are going to have in a month and we take every penny of that and we allocate it under all these different categories unfortunately there's a big category called miscellaneous oh that one gets used up quick is that it and uh miscellaneous that's the one that kills us every time miscellaneous is never what we figure it's going to be it's never what it was last month and uh and uh you know it's it's the one that's always the killer that's um but i uh you know it's uh in fact when uh we pay our check when we when we you know write our checks we even categorize our payments and i mean we even get into that kind of detail um so so oh wow that's really that is pretty detailed so we i mean we do uh when you know whenever we go through the process of paying the bills we know exactly what category we're paying it for and uh we have a pretty good sense of where our money's going we don't have any control over it but we have a real good sense of where it's going well but you know that's good too because i've been in the situation in the past where i didn't know where my money was going and that yeah that's hard to you know you can't keep up with it and it really gets you in trouble you know and yeah well we're we're at a point where we're trying to accomplish a lot of things right now and uh like my wife's going back to school and i'm going to school and we're our kid we've got the kids who are at the stage where they need to take piano lessons and and uh you know play baseball and and do all those fun things oh yeah and uh i think i think we'd be totally bankrupt if we didn't do something um and and what we've proven to ourselves what we prove to ourselves every month is that we're spending more than than we make so it's it's kind of depressing to see it in black and white but uh yeah yeah that's easy to do it's very easy to do and it's i don't it do you find it easier to i mean do with a budget do you feel like you're you do i mean i know you said you have better control but right do you feel like you're really saving anything i mean um well no i i i think um i i i don't think we're saving anything i i think what we're doing is we're we're we're making it possible to to well and the fact what it is is it's making it possible to live beyond our means um because oh well that's you know what if we didn't track it we'd we'd totally blow it i think is what it would end up um um so you know we we do know that we can tell when we're getting to the point where we've just got to uh hold back on something uh we can we can see a cash flow that says this you know we can't do this right now because the money's just not there we we we're going to have to put it off for a week or a month or whatever the case so so yeah it you know it's um um-hum we uh you know we're not going to get this budget isn't going to make us rich but it is going to prevent us from going into poverty uh but yeah which is easy to do yeah uh-huh but we look at it sort of as an investment in the future too you know i'm going back to school my wife's going back to school too our lifestyle right now is meant to position ourselves so financial the these financial problems won't be problems uh in the future and uh so yeah we've that's that's the we're look we look it as as yeah we're living like this now but it's a short term investment for for a better lifestyle later on right well that's good i know what you mean about the school because that's what i'm trying to do also and we're trying to build it enough so that i can go to school full time because right now i'm going to school part time yeah right we're going we're going through the exact same thing yeah so you know trying to budget is again you know at this point we're trying to budget enough so we can yeah save more um you know so i can go to school full time sure you know it's it's not easy to do but and no i i don't know that we'd ever be able to get to that point but uh um but it's something to work for oh oh it definitely is and i tell you what if you work hard enough it'll happen because because i can we can see it you know i think it's going to be a couple of years before i can do that yeah yeah sure that's i think we're in probably in the same position but you know but at least i can see a little bit of the light just from you know doing this you know budgeting and stuff it really helps yeah right right yeah but yeah um and and and it also makes it possible you i think before we did any kind of budgeting we we were in a constant state of saying we can't afford anything right you know we can't do anything we can't afford anything and now we can at least say well we can fit this in it doesn't really work very well but we can fit this expense in and so by being a little organized we can we can allow ourselves some things that we couldn't before yeah it really makes a world of difference doesn't it yeah it really does i know i've been in like i said the same situation you know where i've i've been in a situation where i didn't budget anything just spent money and spent money and spent money and it doesn't work it doesn't it really doesn't uh makes a big difference right that's right that's right it it it yeah i we i think that uh part of the the reason we we we got so almost fanatical about budgeting is that that there were those years where we lived that way yes and we're still paying for it oh definitely you know and so the only way to get out from under that is to is to do some kind of budgeting yeah um yeah you don't want to especially when it comes time and the kids are grown up and they're they want to do things like go to college uh you don't want to say we'll still paying for the mistake we made twenty years ago you know and right yeah well that's that's a big that's really important because i do have a college fund set aside for my kids yeah you know and my oldest one is um almost going on nine so you know it's not that many years you know before she's going to be going so i hope that you know i can continue the college fund because it's yeah that's right that's right i know it's important that they go to college when they get out of high school right well you know i we're we're we're trying to put money away for that too and uh um um you know you just can't count on them being totally brilliant though though they are but you can't count on them being totally brilliant uh so that they can get scholarships and and things like that um it's you know right no that's true i mean it doesn't always work that way you hope you hope that they can but you know you can't plan right yeah that's right right that's that's the way you have to do it right no right right or at least loans that they pay off yeah yeah well no that's that's an important thing to me and that's why it was very important for me because i didn't go to college out of high school it was important for me to budget in uh yeah a um college fund for them because it was just so important i said i don't want them to go through what i went through sure right they have to have a college fund so well you know the the i'm i'm also hoping that this budget process will rub off on them because uh when i grew up i had no right exactly no involvement in finances whatsoever you know and so when i became an adult and i was responsible for yeah for the money i had no skills and no background and no tools and and uh so we had to learn it the hard way and and um right yes i know exactly i was the same way so we we're trying to get the kids involved with that that you know when they get an allowance uh part of that's supposed to go to savings for instance very good yeah and uh um yeah and they understand our the our process uh-huh you're that's that's that's strange because ours all of their money goes in savings if they need something we buy it for them oh yeah and all their money has to go in their savings account oh you know which maybe i'm being a little bit too harsh but but if they need something i buy it for them yeah yeah you know i mean if it's an absolute need sure you know if i mean if they want something occasionally but most of the time if it's a need i just get it right yeah okay we we can uh be recorded while we talk about it okay well is your does your city have mandatory recycling uh recycling no we don't have mandatory we actually we're kind of slow up here and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer and it's all voluntary so that's interesting cities have a mandatory recycling um there there's some places that are strongly encouraging it then that the city will pick it up that's been one of the arguments here i'm just sitting here looking we've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff but we have to carry it um some distance and some places um you can sell your uh recyclables and um for example um our church was was collecting newspapers yeah when when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing we got like a penny a pound for them well it turns out that so much the problem in Texas is that uh they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to uh reprocess it oh my that it requires an extremely it requires uh essentially a paper mill to recycle it and so the value has gone down it turns out it wasn't worth it for the church to do wow i didn't i didn't realize you would think now up here i i suppose they send it all back to the mill and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of uh actually there is one in northern Vermont so there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here i didn't think that you know in the large city that if the next recycling if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it's a lot of money to transport well yeah well see that's in in Dallas there there no plan to build i think that there's some in East Texas there's some pulp mills but uh you have to go to Houston and uh it's interesting and then there's places that'll buy metal and they still buy aluminum can in fact that do you have to buy metal copper is a very good one to collect even aluminum yeah so well do you do do you do recycling uh we do do recycling and our city will pick up our recyclables they have these little blue bins um i don't recycle personally i i'm saying i want to do it oh but i don't get a lot of magazines i don't get a i don't buy the newspaper but i do have a lot of uh my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cardboard a lot of different papers and cardboards well do you do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans yes but we have a bottle return a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles we've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years oh so it's worth taking them back well see we don't have we have we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles oh they should definitely get um the nickel returnable it's great for the kids because see a lot of the kids get the money from it and it's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes oh that's interesting you know that you know that there is a down side to all this you know about no good deed going unpunished that uh my mother sells um trees that they make paper out of and so every time i recycle newspapers uh in fact there's uh there's a uh Kimberly and Clark the the makers of kleenex and such yeah has a uh a big paper mill in fact i almost went to work for them i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me but it's twenty or thirty miles from my house every time you recycle that's one less tree my mother can sell and uh so it's a question should i be diligent and um um and recycle and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood uh uh yeah i see that but it it it's an interesting point though that uh you know everybody's so anxious to recycle and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment but uh but it takes away employment from the resource that its using well but in general i think it's a good idea because there's like the glass you can't argue that the glass it doesn't biodegrade and and uh the plastics obviously they don't i do too uh they don't either so we might as well recycle those yeah like i say it's not a very controversial thing everyone thinks we should do it it's just that we're so lazy i mean like personally i don't want to clean my i just have can cat food i don't want to clean the can and take the label off it and put it in a separate bin yeah you know i'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash well that's what we've got ours we we started about New Year's we decided we'd get ambitious we took one load over there and now we've got these containers filling up with stuff and you know it it it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these uh containers over there well i think i i would be like when i bring my bottles back um if if if they're pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them over and bring them over now if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if you said wash all the cans and things i wouldn't mind if it sat around too much but if if it stunk or something i wouldn't like doing it but um i produce quite a bit of trash my you know house and i see it but i don't see so much that i can recycle like i say it's a lot of different type paper and cardboard i'm not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper yeah um pretty much and i and i don't know how they sort that but if if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i would i would have a recycling center but now it's just me and my husband so i don't know but every little bit helps right yeah i know what you're saying like well we have it at work we have a very aggressive recycling at work and i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin see some people the recycle bin is on their way out what instead of carrying your newspapers when they get done with them at the end of the day they throw them in the trash well do you have separate trash cans at your desk um no we don't but other other offices do they have a box for papers well we have we have one that's recyclable and and then for uh lunch sacks and and waste food and and they gave us a list of things that aren't recycle and it turns out it's not so bad i i i get a lot of reports that that are covered in plastic or plastic like Saran Wrap or something anyway and then uh and cardboard there's a few interesting that we're we're recycling computer type paper yeah and and and uh one day they'll pick up uh the the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper and then the next day they'll pick up the other so oh depending on how much uh you know and there's a lot of uh actually it works pretty well and then we have uh uh waste uh cans for aluminum in the in the break areas at work and so well that's that's a really good idea because um like our uh fruit fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit it oh they're they're thinking about putting a deposit on them because pretty much you have to you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because most yeah probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they're beer and soda but when they sell juice it's some strange quirk in the law you don't have to have a deposit on it and even like the you know a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it but if it's got soda in it it does so it's a strange that's an interesting distinction that yeah they should they should clean clear that up it wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on uh on the uh juice cans as easily as the soda yeah so but redemption centers are a big thing up here they get a penny a can they handle they give you five cents and the when they return the can to the distributor i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can well see well see those of us that don't have state income taxes yet that's the big debate here in Texas that they their the legislature wants to put one in and it's interesting what people get upset about uh yeah it it really is the the is bottle is bottle return down there a heated debate well no the the big issue was is is uh when we moved here a few years ago is whether it was okay for you to uh drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck oh yeah and throw it out the at the and at uh so well we well well well here you can't can't drink we're we're now civilized now you can no longer you you cannot drink beer and drive but uh but it was it was actually legal well yes well i know i was in Atlanta and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand but here let me put that in a paper cup for you so that was strange but i think if some people they have they say well we're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these um the the recycle center you have to deal with the can and then you have to to recycle it and their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits yeah see how they handle it and see if it's a good way and then do it that way because as i like to say people are making money on it the cans do are worth something well you know the other well the other thing is it also is is a is a a good habit uh to uh just to conserve resources you know whether you know because when you get in the habit of doing that you think in terms of of uh of of things like saving gas okay so are you a freshwater or mostly freshwater uh i yeah i i used to fish uh when i was real young down in Galveston with my parents and freshwater i never really got into that too much because you have to get in the boat really to do anything and i didn't know anybody who had a boat now so i don't fish too much in saltwater um-hum most of my fishing has been in the saltwater oh really huh mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish oh neat and uh huh i have caught one or two small sharks oh really and uh yes what'd you do with them put them back you didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do no no no i love shark steak but uh the ones i caught were never large enough to uh really do anything uh do they have a limit on sharks i mean is that like a a sport fish can you actually catch those and there's no limit is there a limit i have no idea i know i my home is in uh Pensacola Florida so uh-huh it's they do a lot of shark fishing in that you know in the gulf right and um a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf coast from i guess from Galveston to Mayport they have uh shark tournaments and you know there's part either as part of or separate from the uh bill fishing tournaments they usually have so i have not done uh much freshwater uh fishing not right oh really oh for you know lake lake fishing for bass and so forth but uh maybe some what they call uh brim and those sorts of things but right uh-huh nothing i think i've been trout fishing once uh i've never fly fished have you fly fished uh no i haven't i don't know that i could do that that looks awful tiring well i've tried it once yes uh a friend of mine did you didn't like it no i could never get the hang of it it looks complicated to me it's a rhythm or something uh-huh i usually ended snagging my uh fishing partners or catching tree bass right did you that would have been something the trees along the bank yes almost got an owl once but uh so do you do you fish mainly for trophies or do you do you eat what you fish oh no no no no i used uh when i was uh working in Florida i used to do a lot of surf um fishing uh-huh mostly for relaxation right you know there are there are people who fish and then there are people who catch right well i'm a fisher you just like to sit down and watch it right that's right i i've never caught that much but uh really oh and occasionally we'd go out on a you know uh full day trip you know three or four other people and do right either again bottom fishing or for grouper or i used to catch you know i've caught a few right worthwhile snappers red snappers and gray snappers and so forth that's nice what about you you a well most of my fishing is done at um area lakes around here freshwater lakes and um-hum um most of it i haven't been really in a long time last time i went i actually was in Galveston trying to saltwater fish and it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle that was real fun um but um i went fishing at i don't know if you've ever heard of uh Lake Worth it's a fairly new lake in Texas oh yes and uh we went fishing there last Memorial Day and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep i was so excited and um that's really about it mostly just the lakes around here and i i fish to take home and cook i don't i don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching i get a little bit of relaxation from it but mainly i um i want to say i brought something home i want to say i did this i was out there for a reason the last time i went uh bass fishing uh i was with my daughter a friend of hers and well a friend of mine and his daughter we i was the only one who did not catch a single fish my daughter caught fish his daughter caught fish he caught fish really everybody but you i did not even i did not even i have been i was out on a party boat a few years ago and we we were grouper fishing or you know actually we were uh snapper fishing everyone on the boat was catching snapper snappers except it had to be you you couldn't catch one to save your life guess who i could i that's right i would go from one side of the boat to the other and uh the uh the party boat captain could not understand you know he even even he started baiting my hook and holding holding the uh the fishing rod how funny just hoping maybe he could fool them right and it was it was really really really bad uh i as i said i am a fisher i'm not a catcher but uh right i enjoy it though i don't really get out as much as i uh as i would like too and uh yeah they do of course you know here in um we're only just a few not a few minutes we're you know forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in Maryland right and they do a lot of fishing there of course what i used to like to do though is uh go snorkeling for scallops in some of the bays or uh oh yeah or oyster for oysters that would be fun and uh that i was able to do uh when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom right hand picked that's right the weirdest fishing experience i ever had and uh people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught we were in uh Rockport which is close to Corpus um-hum and we had been fishing in a canal they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area and uh we'd been fishing in the canals and all we were catching were catfish and we were pretty bored with that so we thought well maybe there are some crab in here we'll try to catch some crab so i got my chicken neck and all my little net and everything and something i had a rock to weight it down something grabs and just runs with it and of course there's no hook so it can't be a fish i'm sure it's not a fish right um-hum and crab they don't bite like that they don't just run with your food so i netted it and it was the ugliest fish i've ever seen in my life It had real teeth like human teeth and it looked archaic i i had no idea what it was i called my father long distance just to describe the thing and it had the rock in it's mouth it not the chicken but the rock itself is what it had grabbed they say it's a dogfish from everything i've described it was brown with these little white dots and it made a loud kind of almost a croaking noise like a croaker does hm uh-huh uh-huh it it was the strangest thing it oh i'll never get over that to this day i don't want to get in the water anywhere around salt water because i'm sure one of those fish are there well we used to i guess the weirdest thing i've ever caught is uh in some of the inlets and the rivers around Rehoboth Delaware um-hum they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker i don't know if you've ever heard of it i've never heard of that one and it has a huge strong mouth and they actually uh use their teeth to open oysters that's where it gets its name obviously huh um-hum and this is the ugliest fish i have ever seen and i mean and they come in all size you know i've i've caught them from you know three or four inches long um-hum up to uh i guess the largest largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long but just huge ugly things just terrible huh can you eat them no no ooh i i don't think i'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly but they just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them that's like this dogfish it was it scared me to death um-hum it was ugly it really it didn't look like it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died well the first time i went uh surf fishing was in and i threw my line out and the first thing i caught was a sand shark which was probably a foot and a half or uh two feet long and scared me to death i i had never seen anything and then i was fished fished for another half hour or forty five minutes caught a few white fish and so forth oh and then i felt something relatively heavy and i thought oh really here i'm really going to get one and i pulled uh uh interestingly enough in my younger days i taught school for two years while my husband was getting his business established and i find the changes uh in the school system um-hum i think a lot of them very positive uh since his retirement the first of January in nineteen ninety i've gone back to subbing and of course subbing is a very different endeavor than teaching uh yes it's very difficult and i've after almost two years i've become a little bit disillusioned and i'm not real sure that i'm going to go back to it because uh of discipline uh although i've never had a problem with it i guess i've just gotten a little tired of fighting yeah what what do you said you think there're some improvements what do you think the improvements have been i think uh the quality of education in the high school system here is better i think the teachers that we have now are more professional and i think the students are more education minded than they were twenty years ago um-hum i think the problems that i see in the system uh are i i tend to see more in uh large inner city school districts that uh and i've i've noticed that uh suburban or rural schools tend to have much fewer problems at least what i from what i hear than than than the inside the city school districts uh-huh uh-huh and so i think the problem isn't so much the school system as in the things that go on around it in the community itself that spill over so to speak yeah um-hum well my my personal opinion is that so many parents especially those parents who are in a lower income and have to spend more of their energy on work they say okay well i i don't have to teach my kids anything the school's going to do it for me and i think the school can't uh-huh do that the school can only exist as something to help the parents out not something to take the parents' place um-hum i find that the school uses the parents as an excuse and the parents use the school as an excuse however um that that can be yeah we're in uh as i said a small town in Indiana and it's a WASP community with a student body of five hundred in the high school so the setting is very different than it would be in um-hum Dallas or Chicago or even Indianapolis which is a couple hours south of us uh but to me the the more gifted or the higher intelligent children are more geared to learning than they were they're more into the school system than they were twenty years ago and uh i find the Say No to Drugs campaign here um-hum to be i think very effective unless i have my head in the sand uh-huh yeah um that you know kind of goes along it it it's a small enough school where people can know each other and and they can work together to thwart off problems when when you've got a high school with you know three or four thousand students uh-huh um there's just no it's it's very difficult to keep track of them all uh-huh oh sure there are high schools as large as our community yeah which makes a totally different situation i've i've never felt that pouring more tax dollars in was the answer to solving any school problems or most of the school problems yeah the i i find that i i haven't seen any cases where that's been very effective and that seems to be what people want to do is just you know put more money into it and i just don't have a whole lot of confidence in that uh-huh i also you know i consider for example the the teachers the National Education Association you know they i would like to see them be more of a professional organization rather than a union because we need you know we need to we need to uh instead of worrying about saving jobs or raising salaries i think we need to worry about uh how well the job's getting done uh-huh isn't that the way with most groups though they become a self-protection thing uh of saving jobs or getting more salary uh um-hum yes i do i do find that the majority the majority of teachers in our group are very professional but then of course we're a stable community and many of them have been in the system for twenty years which i just can't think you'd find that in a large city school yes um-hum uh but you know back to the idea of parents i my my personal feelings is that parents need to be taking more responsibility i think the way i like to look at it you know a lot of people look at well whose job is it to teach the kids well it's the school's job i think whose job is it to teach the kids well primarily it's the parents job uh-huh uh-huh because the kids spend more time with the parents than they spend at school and the school is just there to help the parents uh-huh uh-huh so i think the the number one responsibility is on the heads of the parents and and we need to get to the idea well if the kids are are doing poorly in school then the parents need to take some sort of responsibility and and take some sort of action instead of just complaining about what the school is doing or not doing and sometimes if the parents don't like the way the school is being run the appropriate action is to have the choice to take that kid out of that school and put him in a different school except we don't have another school yeah that's in in small communities that's a difficult choice but then the small communities are the ones with fewer problems uh-huh because they have fewer students yeah it's it's the big cities that have these kind of problems and there i like to see that the parents be able to have a choice saying i don't like the way this school is being run i want to send my child to someplace where they'll be properly uh uh-huh properly taught and properly uh trained you don't find that parents are getting more involved in your area some parents are but some parents don't have the opportunity to do that as easily you know people that are working two jobs or single parents uh that sort of thing um-hum um-hum uh-huh i think single parents probably contribute a lot of the problems in school systems because the system's really getting sixty percent of the student's day if if the mother or the father certainly would have to work and they're not getting home until probably five o'clock at the very earliest and the student's out at three um-hum i think really uh the school does have more of that student's time because eight hours of the time that the student is with the parent they're going to be sleeping and certainly the parent needs some social life besides uh yeah um-hum and you know what it feels like to come home after a long day at work you you just you you want to rest for a little while and and maybe the children uh don't want you to rest they might need to be dealt with yeah yeah and it's it's a difficult problem and it's one that well basically i think in in in large measure it's it's it's up to the parents to take the responsibility for what's happening to their childrens education i think uh-huh uh-huh And we did have we did recently have a a group here formed called Students for Academic Excellence that was formed by concerned parents and they see that these these kids are getting honor jackets and they're getting certificates and they're getting uh more access to scholarships uh on a par with the athletes which uh this was formed i think probably in the last three years and that's been a very positive thing for education itself because so often the emphasis is on um-hum uh baseball basketball and football and it gets away from what the school is established for originally um-hum yes and here here in Texas if you don't like football y ou're considered a heretic uh well this is basketball in Indiana so yes that was going to be my guess uh-huh We do all have our sport In fact we've been on a real high here because our basketball team won their regional for the first time in the history of the school So sport is uh has been really first and foremost here in the last month But we hope that education is first and foremost for the year nice talking to you um-hum alright well thank you for the call uh-huh bye bye hi Kay hi i uh was thinking about salaries and benefits and uh was wondering what's the most important thing to you besides a salary in a job uh-huh well um i we just recently graduated from Rice University and uh we were going through a lot of job interviews and things and some of the things that were important to me my uh when my husband was looking for his job was um hours you know we he had been in graduate school so i was used to his not being home at all so i was you know didn't want him to have a job that yeah would make him kind of be on call all the time and have to go in at any time and you know even on the weekends and and um and things so that was important to me and also insurance uh-huh for the family our family because we'd like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it sure yeah i don't ever want to have to worry about that that's real important to me um you know we have that that Aetna uh-huh um that's what we the insurance that we have right now when we were in Colorado they had um a different type of HMO there that i really liked a lot um-hum us too um-hum it was um not that kind of HMO's where you have to go to their they're sort of like clinics you know uh but this was just an HMO where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular um-hum hospitals and all that but it was with a certain list of of doctors that you know participated in the HMO um-hum and um you know then you only had to pay the it for us it was a five dollar copayment every time you went to the doctor and uh three dollars for the prescriptions well that's nice uh-huh that's good and uh i especially liked the prescription especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time that those prescriptions can be very expensive um-hum oh i know we just went through that ourselves we just you know were like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things oh i know especially if you get what is it Seclor i think that that just about breaks the bank right there um-hum the yes yes it's pretty bad well yeah and we um we were interested in having dental dental insurance too because um well having been in school we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff and um-hum do you we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over and do you have the basic plan or do you have the the other one we have um you know we're at Aetna with uh an we have like the medical the dental insurance is separate is that what you mean and i don't think it's the basic i think it's the other one right the one that's like you get additional they'll pay a little bit more i think for the different procedures we just have the basic right now and um-hum uh-huh for most things it tends to cover it we don't have too many major um expenses at this point but we have been able to find doctors dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays a couple of times we've had to pay oh i don't know three to five dollars but that's not that bad uh-huh no that's great yeah we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too yes and let's see besides insurance other things that we looked at um well my husband does not like to commute very far and and we don't like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or something um-hum no we don't like that either so we kind of looked for where where the uh his office would be located and how far well he's uh you know he's at the one that's at um is his office in Plano seventy five at uh six thirty five and so well by living in Plano we're just about fifteen minutes away and uh-huh uh-huh oh that's not bad especially especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didn't want him to let you know to like we had some job offers in the New York area and we thought well you know he would be really commuting right oh yes you're not kidding and not only is it you know trouble to have to drive but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving that's right and um so that was something that was important to us and because like like i say i we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long that we were anxious to do everything we could to have you know made us be more together and and what other can you think of another thing that you guys looked at and well that those are some of the things that are very important to us too um um-hum we we'd like you know other benefits that are provided um the athletic facilities that that you can sometimes take advantage of um um-hum i think that's that's pretty nice but i have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or or any of that but that's a that's a nice benefit to have um-hum that's true that's really important um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement i think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be having having now but when when could uh your salary increase and right is there was there somewhere to go yeah that that's one of the i think the hard things right now i mean they're going through some some tough times to say the least uh i know many of us are thankful that he still has a job um-hum yes that that we can make our mortgage payments and yeah that's really true uh uh one of the drawbacks i think of working for a big company is often times you do have to follow pretty rigid um guidelines um if if an employee is especially exemplary i think it's often in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say hey you know this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing a lot of times um-hum smaller companies have bonus plans where i think in a large company it's hard to do that because there're just so many people to deal with and you have to have guidelines if you know for salary increases and things like that um-hum just one of the things that that happens when someone when you're dealing with a large company uh-huh but but well we also were interested in um you know being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some uh opportunity for um-hum for friendships that way so that you would feel happy going to work everyday and rather than thinking oh i really i can't stand these people i but uh so that's something that was important to him and right thinking he could um work under those how long has he been in his present position oh just since last last summer it's only been not even a year yet so uh-huh well i was going to say it sounds like you you picked out a lot of good things you know for him to to have to uh to choose in a position that has a lot of thought put into it in a big company though you also get moved around a lot he may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some time or or we may be having to drive to Plano you never know yes we're oh yeah you never know we're hoping that that won't be the case we i think one of the most one of the most deciding factors of why we chose um this area is that um my husband was raised in Irving uh-huh and so he we have a lot of family here his side of the family and being when we were down in Houston we were isolated i mean it's not that far but people would have we didn't have anyone in town that was our family and although we had really good friends and and we had church and school support and things um right we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that yeah we're very so that really made a big difference i think in why we chose TI and chose to move this way we're very far from our families and it's really hard families little children and um they were the only grandchildren and so our our families are are are really far away in fact this is a little off the topic but yesterday my mother happened to be on a train going from Phoenix to back to Chicago and it stopped in Dallas for a half an hour so um-hum i loaded the kids in the car and we went downtown and met her train for half an hour and brought her a little snack and an Easter basket and i think it it made her trip a little bit nicer oh that's nice yeah and it is i think it is important to you know want to be close to your family and yeah i mean it's it's hard i mean to to just for us to snatch a half hour like that is is a special occasion for us so um um-hum well that's definitely the way we feel it's nice it's nice that you can have your family close like that we're really enjoying it i wonder what it would be like i mean i i wanted to be close to family but i also thought that it would be harder to be close to family but it's turned out really good and i think that you know we're really satisfied with that choice and yeah sometimes it can be we you know kind of felt like um it was worth it to us that's good but anyway well i my children just ran out the door so i need to go check on them but i've really enjoyed this conversation conversation and and uh nice to have met you and you have a good day okay bye-bye okay well i have too okay you too bye-bye okay well um discussing air pollution today i guess um-hum um uh well give me your first impressions uh i don't know there's a lot of air pollution yeah um i think industries and companies provide a lot of it um-hum and with uh i guess with the oil burning over in Kuwait and stuff that would have a lot of air pollution in it uh puts a whole yeah gets a whole new picture to what real air pollution can be but uh that stuff going on over there what what uh what part of Pennsylvania are you in um i'm north of Pittsburgh so okay okay okay so it's it's it's amazing too you know you with that with the oil wells burning over there that's that's the exact same stuff that's coming out of cars every day just in uh just in a little different grade i guess yeah but uh in Dallas we've got we've just uh brought in a whole new set of uh requirements on inspections and things like that for cars because uh people just don't use mass transit and stuff in Dallas everybody loves their car and you see an awful lot of uh one person vehicles on the road on during rush hours that seems to be our biggest problem down here um you know there's uh there's a lot of industry around but uh it's not it's any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air it's typically water type situation yeah um we have a couple we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff and i know there's a lot of air pollution going in there and like they they get fined whenever they do the air pollution but um-hum the fine is nothing you know it's like nothing to them yeah it's it's yeah like like two hours of output or something like that yeah that's true that's true yeah yeah um-hum yeah i uh i grew up in South Dakota so i was never i was never exposed to anything of of the of the sort um uh-huh there were always the EPA people and what not were always telling us that uh farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that but we just we just never saw the results uh um-hum there was there was dust in the air during uh planting seasons and what not but uh that that was all we ever saw and then five years ago i i moved to Dallas and i suddenly start to understand what uh burning eyes uh and all that stuff is about that i'd always heard about it uh it's it gets it's real depressing um in the morning sometime uh just you you can tell if it's a good day or a bad day by uh how far out from downtown uh you you can be on the road and still not see it oh my God and uh yeah you know i mean it's not uh i don't think Dallas is considered uh a a real bad place for for air pollution but you you can tell you can tell the differences in the days when it's when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a a foggy misty color uh-huh and uh it it's a little it's a little disappointing sometimes that you start to realize what you're breathing uh yeah but i i don't know what they can do to really prevent it you know like how can what can they do about the oil burning over in Kuwait what you know i mean they fine the the industries but you know that doesn't seem to stop them there i don't know what else they can do right right it's it's that there really isn't a whole lot it's it's one of those uh it's one of those things that if they do a little bit and uh and every you know every every little bit does help i i do believe that um but i also believe that uh the earth is is a kind of a self-regulating system and uh it will clean itself up eventually it the whole idea is not to not to push the limit too hard i guess let let the you know let the natural natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible um-hum yeah i i yeah i just don't understand you know what else anyone can do about it i don't think it's something that people really think about either um-hum you know it's i mean i it it should probably be a big issue you know because it's it's doing a lot of damage but i it's something you know i don't think many people really think about it because it's nothing they i don't think we really have too much control over it right and it's one of those things it's it's it's so hard to measure uh what what what the damage is it's it's kind of like uh um-hum oh i guess it's kind of like kind of like cigarette smoking you know it it it it could go on for years and years until they they start start to see some results and people can actually actually say yeah it's it's it's doing it's doing some damage and and something's got to be done um-hum um there's you know there's a lot of things like that it it it you can uh you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks but until it breaks you don't really know that there you were doing anything to it yeah exactly but uh well i really don't know too much else about it yeah well that's it you know i i i think we both agree it's it's one of those deals that uh i just think there's a lot of other problems right now and uh we've done a lot to take care of it um-hum yeah and uh yeah we have tried i mean you know and um i i know where you know where a couple of the mills that have i know i know they put things on their stacks you know to filter the smoke and do all kinds of things but i mean every now and then it breaks you know and and you just got smoke going out into the air for a day or two till you can get it fixed and stuff oh sure sure so you know it's something we we have tried to help but yeah oh there's no doubt about i don't know if you if you ever happened to see uh some of the like Twenty Twenty and what not about uh Romania and East Germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their uh systems had been running for twenty and thirty years um um-hum and uh you know they absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted that's that's the kind of things that uh you don't see in this country and that's that's why i think that you know it's it's i don't know if you can ever do enough but uh i think it's all relative to the to the time and place and i think right now it's it's it's pretty much under control yeah okay well um-hum it's been nice talking to you okay bye-bye all righty well you bet bye okay Jim um can you tell me a little bit about your opinions on capital punishment uh the bottom line that i after four years of working with the state prison system i've come to the conclusion if you're going to give the man the death sentence go ahead and fulfill the sentence understandably the Supreme Court says any time you hand down a death sentence to somebody they get a one appeal once that appeal fails within thirty days execute sentence if you're going to give the man the death sentence don't keep the guy on death row for eight nine ten years and make him worry about it yeah plus costing the taxpayers twenty five thousand dollars a year just to keep the guy locked up well you've you've got a point there but um do you think one appeal is is too stringent no i do not think one appeal is everybody's entitled to one appeal okay now um what do you think about about the death penalty itself do you think that we should have a death penalty absolutely and i wish they would exercise it more thoroughly let the punishment fit the crime in this state we've got a very weird situation going on we're under federal supervision and i agree to a point i agree with how the system works in some respects in other ways i don't for first time offenders everybody's entitled to screw up once we'll give them the early release credits we'll give them the good time credits we'll give them the early parole second trip down whether it's for the same crime or totally separate one you serve your sentence day for day third trip down this is where my views on it goes way far beyond what the law states third trip down if it's for the same offense or for a totally different one this individual has proven that he does not want to conform to the rules of society so you kill him period end of story yeah well i kind of think we're too lenient number one now i work in Massachusetts but i live in Rhode Island so the the legislature just come out and said that because of what with treating the prisoners so-called brutally because uh the state prison's overcrowded we have to release them so they took the offenders with the the minor crimes and they let them go they didn't have to serve the rest of their term and which is absolutely incredible um i think number one my opinion is that the judges are too lenient but yet you get some of the jury trials and and it comes down to the nitty gritty when people are ready to condemn a person they always kind of forgive him a little bit nobody wants to put the finger on somebody and say well that's it you know we're going to kill you so it's got to be up to the judges i think we need we have to put into place judges that are stricter than the ones that are in there now and the other thing is i'm not sure about Texas but like in Rhode Island if someone breaks into your home you have to do your utmost to leave so you can't cause a confrontation with that person you can't shoot him you can't do anything with him i'm not sure what Texas is uh Texas has got it rigged to where i can't shoot the guy can enter my property and i can't shoot him but once he's physically inside my house uh the law reads to where you can defend yourself if you feel your life is being threatened yeah at two o'clock in the morning if somebody's in my living room i feel real threatened so i'm going to come out with guns blazing yeah it's yeah and ours yeah and see in our case it's you have to you have to exit you have to leave and if you have to leave your home to get away from this individual that's what you should do so what choice have you got you know as far as as far as our laws go up here well the the legal system in this country has gone to such extreme measures they've swung so far away from yeah you're fading there there is no such thing as justice in this you're fading away Jim country anymore we only have situation ethics i said yeah the guy robs the liquor store and yeah he shot the owner but he was under the influence of narcotics huh that that should make absolute zero difference you shot the guy you get the death penalty period that doesn't make any right right and so he was under the influence of narcotics at that time when when the act was was performed but he knows he's going to go back and do the same thing over again you know when he's straight so so-called so people like that any one i believe you if you murder someone i believe in an eye for an eye and i think probably uh uh maybe the majority of the people do at least the people that uh that i talk to you go out there and you kill somebody you rob a gas station or a drug store and you shoot somebody you deserve to be killed also that should be automatic death penalty no if ands or buts right right um you're subject to one appeal i i kind of don't agree with you on that i think probably you should have at least two appeals but that's what's got our system bogged down so bad now they've appealed everything to where if they've got one typographical error where in their in one line instead of spelling they've got one word misspelled i mean it's a very minor clerical error they couldn't tell they they'll appeal the hell out of that and that just throws another wrench and it takes two years to work an appeal yeah that's yeah right common sense has to has to set in some place it's just like uh uh organized crime now they know all these people they know that the the leaders of organized crime and all that sort of stuff why can't they do something about it because they can't if they if they tape something they can't they can't bring it into the court as as evidence and they know they just had this uh i don't know if it's been in your newspapers but um the guy that got out of prison here to go to a mafia um swearing in ceremony and they got uh uh somebody and i'm not sure who who it was what organization what law enforcement agency they got a movable bug a a a court order for a movable bug which means that you can take it any place and put it any where uh-huh and now they're contesting that movable bug because they didn't state that they were going to put it in this particular home where this meeting took place so there's a technicality there but they know outright that these people are murderers and whatever else you got and yet they're not going to let that evidence in you know as admissible evidence in court so that has to be looked at too um i don't know who they're protecting they're not protecting the innocent that's for sure since so people that came up with the laws that made all these loopholes and technicalities take a look at your congressmen and senators you'll find that the vast majority of them are practicing lawyers that's true that's true um self-preservation of the species i guess right that's it what they don't realize the time is coming and i see it coming over the horizon that the majority of American people people are getting fed up with their BS and are demanding are going to demand real justice instead of this well the in Texas in Texas we're getting to a point where a guy gets a fifteen year sentence he's going to serve fifteen months and he's out you're kidding one month for one year actually assigned because of because of what because of overcrowding or overcrowding overcrowding huh now the pendulum's going to swing more and more people we've gone too far to the left it's fixing to come back hard right yeah because you look at the statistics now and i'm sure it's in your your newspapers just like it is in ours that every major city now the increase of crime is is escalating i mean there are more look at the look at the people there are being shot now i mean every day there's there's dozens of dozens of people across the nation they just get blown away for no reason you know stray bullets or California they were going out there and they were shooting and they get these guys and they don't do anything with them so i kind of i kind of agree with you i'm kind of you still in the in the uh prison system yeah i've been with them for about four years now how do you like it well all things considered i'd rather be a cop on the street because once i walk inside the gates the inmates have more rights than i do say an inmate swings at me or he's raised his fist threateningly toward me i've got to let him hit me before i can hit him bac k to be justified have it called what they call a justified use of force that's incredible thank uh federal judge named William Wayne Justice do you uh you carry a firearm in when you're in there no in inside the gate i do not carry any weapon at all nothing nothing not even a uh uh billy club or huh what's the purpose of that so they can't take it so they can't take it away from you yeah well i don't know so you going to make a career out of it i seriously doubt it oh it it it all boiled down to when the opening for this came up it was the best deal going it was paying so much more money than what i was making before i couldn't turn it down oh okay is it uh was it uh civil service uh actually really really all right well on this subject i really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home so i've always been involved you know in one uh-huh how do you feel about them i mean since you've kind of been close to that well i've yes well i can kind of see both sides you know i really can um nursing homes to me i i would personally be the last resort you know i really you know if i had to put someone in there uh-huh well i've had a touch of experience my um dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him yeah if it's a have to thing yeah i yeah and uh she put him in but he wasn't there very long before he died but uh-huh um i guess um the one time that i saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay uh-huh but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and that's always kind of bothered me yeah uh-huh yeah well i kind of think that's true too i guess because it's so under staffed you know um-hum that's like everything else though i have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home but i've never actually been there and i know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about uh-huh yeah yes but yeah but still i'm sure there are you know aspects to it that aren't really desirable yeah yeah i know because i've always well my sister's involved in one also and i really think they really do a wonderful job but still there's those little things that happens you know there really is which i think it's a wonderful place you know if it comes to that yeah you know if you just can't take care of them any more well sometimes you don't have any other alternative after all family and friends are usually well family's tied up with uh-huh that's it yeah uh-huh their own lives and things and usually working and other things yeah yeah yeah but i think when the time comes i i hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at it's hard to yes um-hum i think that's important too in fact there's a not just i do too outside's awful deceiving sometimes yes you know there's one uh close to where my mother is but in order to get in you have to be able to um walk in on your own in other words you can't be in you know too bad a shape to start out with but then if you deteriorate um yeah yeah they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time cares yeah yeah but it's always well and they have a long waiting list too so there's always this feeling of well golly gee you know you've got to be able to walk in the door so you can't wait until you're too bad off off yeah but then you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like uh you have to give up your automobile or whatever to oh um-hum and everything you worked for so hard for all your life yeah yeah and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee i'm you know i'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment uh-huh uh-huh so it's kind of a that's a hard one but it is a very nice nursing home now there is some really nice ones there's also you know some private ones you know um-hum but of course i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that you know that's way out of my reach yeah that's the problem the expense of it all is and uh what i another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately uh-huh yeah oh yeah yeah but those who don't have money can go in and get the same care uh-huh the very same yeah yeah you know so i don't like that aspect yeah but i there's i think there's ways around it though that you know like they could put it in one of their children's names or something yeah you know but still a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that you know it's their money this is that's right you know that's how i feel about it anyway well yeah i've talked to my mother about that several times lately and i i said i want you to have control of your own business yes yeah but you know what if yeah my mother's seventy now so naturally she's retired but she's still on her own i mean you know yeah yeah my mother's uh seventy five and still has her own home and everything yeah i think that's wonderful i really do just as long as they can and then on the other hand i've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know yeah that's true they have a lot of people around to do things with some of those places have wonderful activities and things uh-huh they're not lonely you know lots of stuff going on and they'll take them places and oh yes uh-huh yeah so i don't know it's not all bad but i guess once you get ill then you know you really no have some problems if you can't get around and do things around yeah but i really don't know what the other solution would be you know i really don't no But no when the time comes i'm really hopefully we'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents um-hum really do because i have been raised in one you know so there's lot of things i know to look for yeah and i don't think they'd want to go where they used to work either you know i really don't it really would yes yeah that might be kind of tough huh yes and like like i said my sister's still in it and i really don't think my mother want to be there either oh well it's been nice talking to you and i guess we'd better get back to work huh all right bye-bye well you too okay bye well do you exercise regularly Judy um i try to ride the stationary bicycle everyday about five miles um-hum and i love to walk so if i have a lunch hour with nice weather i get out and and walk what about you well um i uh exercise regularly i work at a university and i swim almost everyday uh very good upwards of a mile but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit uh my daughter lives in Arlington and when i go to visit her i love to get out on that bike trail and either ride the bike oh gosh you can ride a bike practically all the way to southern Virginia um-hum or just get out and walk uh or even jog a little although i don't do that regularly but Washington's a great place to do that uh-huh yeah there are there are lots of bike paths i know my son is a biker and he he's done the whole C and O canal i think it's a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts um-hum and so uh but that that somehow takes organization for me it's much easier just the stationary bike you know it's at home i can i can do some of my reading right um but do you live in the District no i live in Maryland uh-huh because i think there're so many parts of the District where it's not very safe to get out and walk right right and that's it um at work we have a a nice campus so i'm able to um take advantage of of the environment here um um-hum the neighborhood also i mean we're within walking distance of of stores and shops so i do now i think um basically is your motive simply um health or because you enjoy it well it's uh it's really both i'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape and uh and most of the time i enjoy it sometimes i don't but i feel that uh that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i don't wanna is also worth something um-hum right i think pretty much you've summed up my my my motivations also and i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising like i'll be really tired and i'll start swimming and i'll actually and i'll actually get energy and i'll be have much more energy when i'm done than when i started i mean i just feel great that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim oh well that's great that's great that's really a terrific feeling because you just go there at the end of the day and you figure God i'm ready for bed um-hum and you exercise and then it's sort of it's painful for a while but by the time you get done you're feeling really terrific right and actually in in summer i like to swim we don't have facilities for swimming in winter but um and and that's true when i go home from work at the end of the day if i go up for an hour in the pool i'm much much more awake i'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening yeah yeah so so are can i just ask you are you Canadian no i'm not Philadelphia no i'm trying to because you have a you have one funny vowel that's probably gonna drive the TI people crazy you say out instead of out you say out oh really no i don't know that but i i must say that um did you know that when when i did do a linguistics course in in school ages ago um the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent hm and it's probably because i i was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California and at and at that point that was sort of a limit but but since then i've been abroad a lot so hm i see it's a mixture i know this isn't on our topic but where did you grow up in California in Santa Barbara oh okay because i grew up in North Hollywood California i went to UCLA and all that oh i see um-hum well very good and i think we've probably know know each other's exercise habits and um it was nice talking to you yes well same here thanks for calling bye oh okay bye bye okay you want to go first well uh topic being the banking crisis uh that's a real hot topic real real mess i guess you must say yeah sure is yeah it is of course you you've you've had your fair share of that down your way too oh yeah think uh probably i guess it's pretty well wide spread nation wide but i think Texas probably uh suffered and or caused the uh the major or a good portion of it no argument here yeah i i think that uh now i'm i'm no financial expert but from what i've read and heard that makes two of us yeah i think there were some regulations on loans that were lifted that allowed savings and loans to make uh riskier uh investments and of course uh oil was uh one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oil when oil went south real estate went with it people were speculating in the future that without anything to fall back on when prices on both of those went went uh down yeah i understood that shaky uh real estate loans was probably the the major culprit um with the oil crisis well also in investments investments in oil ventures as well because it was predicted predicated on uh a certain price per barrel right to recover the costs of the loan and when oil went from thirty dollars a barrel to twelve dollars a barrel then that just wasn't any way to break even yeah i guess that was the immediate cause yeah uh shoot i don't uh i tell you one thing as far as the way they're handling it i uh i feel pretty strongly about this and that's i think they're over reacting as far as the the uh actions taken against their the little guy the depositor the customers yeah yeah i think they uh they went way to far the other way in the spectrum and on the other hand i don't yep know whether they're doing enough in the way of uh you know redressing the situation and bringing the uh the real you know the the presidents of the banks and those people that are uh really responsible to uh to justice on that didn't didn't they just uh put another another thirty billion dollar Band-Aid on the problem last week or something uh i'm not sure i didn't President approved some more money to bail them out yeah it's going to be uh it's uh your and my money that's doing that you know that's unfortunately well that's true of course it just adds to the to the annual deficit which adds to the overall debt of the nation and uh at some point in time yeah it's either going to be repaid or just completely blown off i'm not sure which which one is which i i really think our whole financial institution is a house of cards waiting to collapse yeah well i guess the hope is that uh they can find some way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to uh to help uh get them out of it yeah now i i'm a staunch Republican but uh you know for the last nine years i've heard that that we would grow our way out of uh out of debt and after the longest sustained economic recovery in in i don't know how many decades it didn't happen and uh i don't know what it's what it's going to take to turn that around that's a good point they uh they got a little uh a little hesitation in the recovery here and uh hopefully they'll rebound from that in a fairly short period of time yeah i think ending the the Gulf War quickly was beneficial uh-huh definitely uh let's see what were some of the other other points she mentioned topic wise uh do we think enough is being done to address it i i i guess it had some blue ribbon panels look into it i don't i don't remember exactly what their findings and recommendations were it seems to me like they really haven't uh at least they haven't if they're doing anything it's still pretty much uh uh not out in the open it's uh you know behind the scenes kind of uh right right sure panels or whatever you know committees or investigations nothing uh nothing that makes headlines that much has been done really i don't think that's true although of course the last six months the headlines have been pretty well dominated by the Persian Gulf yeah maybe now uh that we're putting that behind us that we'll be able to to address this in more depth does tend to uh push that out of the front page sure well hey it's been real good talking with you yeah this will be a first i uh usually end up getting uh told i got three seconds to wrap it up or five seconds or something like that oh uh do they come on does something body come on the line and tell you to do that yeah i think uh one time it was i think ten minutes was the maximum and another time it was uh ended by uh oh what's what's the its capacity was short that day or something yeah what's the minimum is that like three minutes i don't think there is a i don't know if there is a minimum oh okay so i'm uh satisfied we covered the topic on this end i i think so too nice talking with you you bet bye-bye bye-bye so what do you think about it how are we doing in recycling are we well i think we need to do more i i mean i know i need to do more they have programs around where you can reach they uh they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up um-hum but i have a hard time of being able of separating you know having a place separating my trash and get all the cans from the paper and you know i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet so yeah yeah and see i do a lot of work with the boy scouts and we try to do a lot uh-huh but there's still a lot more we can do you know i don't recycle my newspapers myself but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a yeah like a a clothes hamper kind of thing that you know you lay your string in then you put your papers in there and tie them all up and bundle them up so i figured i might get me one of those uh-huh uh-huh because we don't always read the newspaper sometimes it just sits around for a while and then we just chuck it yeah well i don't i don't get the paper every day but i you know i get it on i try to buy you know the early edition for the coupons you know the Sunday edition so yeah but then i just you know bundle it up and put it on the front you know the front walk every you know every Monday or every other Monday and yeah have them pick that up but that's the extent of what i've done i'd like to be able to do more the problem is with a lot of it is you have to go you know it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it you know it's not always convenient to do it yeah see and yeah see and here in Lubbock everything's so close i can imagine what it's like up there yeah i'm not exactly sure where the you know the can thing is but you know sometimes it's just so seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them yeah yeah see i went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall uh-huh and then i put me a little five gallon bucket and it's just outside the garage door so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket uh-huh do those can crushers work good yeah i got one from Payless Cashways and it's actually metal uh-huh it's not plastic i didn't want to buy a plastic one yeah because those things i think would just snap you know yeah but Payless Cashways has them and they're metal and i don't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there but it was only like seven dollars not too bad oh so i'd have to check into something like that because i mean we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here you know but um yeah you know occasionally we have some around but you know for other kind of cans just to it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that don't they yeah i don't yeah i don't think it would crush steel cans it's pretty tough yeah so i don't know i don't think you have to to crush the other ones for them to get to take that but no you could probably just you know i need to look into it more you know it's you know it sometimes even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper you know they won't take paper that's shiny yeah they won't yeah they won't take any lint free paper or see i work at TI yeah so does my husband yeah and we do a lot of recycling out there now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard but that's just now come on board uh-huh uh-huh you know we've been throwing paper out there away for years and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out you know uh-huh yeah i don't know what you know i haven't i'm sure they're probably doing that here some yeah i'm sure they are TI is doing it pretty well nationwide i'm sure uh-huh i think it's necessary i i like it you know it makes i think it's good that you see these you know like boxes cereal they're now starting to make them you know the packages out of recycled paper and oh yeah and i've bought you know i've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper and i think they're just fine yeah yeah i bought a i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work it's his birthday we're pretty good friends and what it is is a recycled paper bag uh-huh and it's just got Happy Birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside and it's just a paper bag uh-huh you know and it's really cute yeah but i think we're doing better and better all the time i still don't yeah i think we're getting becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more so no there's not going to be any room shortly no no you know i don't know what New York does about theirs i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere yeah it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere yeah so but i think we're getting better at it i think there's quite a bit more we could do yeah yeah girls put that away now but you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth but yeah i just wish it was a little more convenient convenient to do you know yeah seems like you're so busy anyway and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about so yeah it sure is i think if you know the cities locally you know they'd get more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier so yeah yeah well they'll get at it sooner i guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later they yeah yeah get the kids interested in it too so you know they have we tried to have a aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that i have and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans yeah you know if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure they'll save them for us there's no problem there but what do you do with them in the meantime now i don't want a can a garage full of cans uh-huh that's right that's right who does that you know people don't have room for that kind of stuff you know no they're just not they're not prepared for it no and in Texas they're just get things like that they just get bugs in them so yeah yeah they do and you know the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get that's for sure so you don't that's right so so i'm pretty lazy about it right now everything goes into one thing and goes out to the you know pick it up so yeah yeah myself about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans uh-huh s o yeah well i need to get better get better at it so well if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way you know yeah that's right that's right if everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then that's true we'll get there that's right well thank you for talking to me yeah well thank you for calling i sure no problem okay take care all righty bye-bye bye-bye
