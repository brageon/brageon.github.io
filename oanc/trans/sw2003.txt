 okay so do you all keep a budget no we don't you don't no i i make so much money here at TI that that we just spend it well and we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck it's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semiconductor firm you can just spend it well are you being smart or are you serious i'm being facetious i'm being very comical uh we have a budget um that works well i kind of look at it for more of a we have a financial uh analyst a finance administrator i guess that that uh uh-huh i guess the financial planners the training now we've had it for about four years here got our businesses and and and our life in line how to manage credit cards how to put away say for you know money markets and this kind of thing uh-huh yeah and there's some freebies out there are you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly bring home in some sort of savings account that being money market uh bonds coda mat savings uh um-hum yeah or a listed liquid account which which we do um you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that um-hum um-hum okay you should always have an umbrella permit that bridges your uh life insurance and your medical and your um um car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm he's going to sue the pants off of you these kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year so you you know these are all equivalent to the monthly budget things some of them are there to pacify situations and some of them are there to prevent things from happening um-hum um-hum but uh i guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a a child which is about a year old and then uh um-hum we've just been kind of working on i've been developing it but it's kind of hard diaper prices are going up you know and formula and stuff you know um-hum that's funny yeah we have a we're twenty eight and he's been working at TI for five years and that was pretty much his first really really major job of any you know professional because he'd worked you know part time during school and what not and uh he was a little late graduating so we're you know uh and we have a nine and a half year old son and it's because you know we were eighteen when we had him so we're we're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of we you know we have a lot for to be our age and you know just everything and having the responsibilities we've had on us for at such a young age you know we have a like a nice house people you know are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house but we don't you know live in a brand new house either maybe an eighty ninety hundred thousand dollar house we live in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty five thousand um-hum um-hum so you know we have trade-offs so we're more we have a monthly budget with this this this this but we have no savings which isn't real wise but we just we don't have the income at this time really to have any because we have three debts that we're trying to pay off from both of our student loans we're still paying trying to pay those off and we have one car payment that we don't i think we have about thirteen months left on it um-hum and after that we either what we want to do is begin doubling up our car payment um they'll pay our car payment is equivalent to both of our student loans so what we want to do is next year keep driving the same cars and um pay on the student loans split that car payment in half and pay you know double up payments on both our loans and it'll work out perfect do you have your uh loans through the Texas Credit Union no we don't okay thing about the credit union is it's the way it's set up is if you have two thousand dollars left let's say on on the loan if you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn't all go towards principal um-hum um-hum they take out for the for the finances the finance charge which is kind of you know it's like one of these lose or swim type of credit one of those loans is not really the best in the world but um um-hum but you know they're they're uh since your husband is is is um a TIer but doesn't have the loans with the credit union they're offering something that might be worth taking a gander at i don't know what your percent is on your on your car payments really um-hum but they are they'll take any TI non credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car they'll take it um-hum um-hum and refinance it and put it with Texas Credit Union at i think it's a ten and a quarter percent oh really which is not a bad deal one of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through GMAC or something um-hum um-hum and she's doing it i mean it's not like it's like does she have to pay to have it refinanced i think they even cover that because they want you as a they want the TIer to be part of the credit union um-hum TIer to see we got ripped off buying our new car we both come out of uh drugs and stuff and we became Christians about five years ago right when he got hired for TI right before he got hired for TI he had uh gotten saved and stuff and so i mean when you get come out of drugs and stuff you have nothing i mean you know you don't have anything you have the clothes on your back and you might have a car and that kind of thing and so when he when he started working at TI we uh you know we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas but we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years and we were young and we'd look about nineteen people still think we're about they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff both of us and so it's just kind of strange you know so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs you know yeah so we went in and the financed the car for five and we didn't know that we got kind of taken just a little bit so we're kind of upset that we're having to you know pay this fifth year on the car because it was just not a wise thing but we learned a good lesson so well five years is not that uh you know five years is not that bad of a problem only because you're paying more interest but your um payments your payments are lower you know yeah but they they would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher oh really and he want yeah he just told me this last week that he he said don't you remember i asked them to finance it at four years and they came back and they said that they had it figured for five and we'd already signed the papers and i maybe i might have been there i don't remember hearing that but i also wasn't the one in charge of it so i wasn't paying as close of attention sure but anyway instead of putting our foot down about it we just went okay whatever you know so anyway so next time we'll do that different we want to next time pay cash for our car too we want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do when we buy a house we attended a Bill Guathier financial seminar and he has a lot of wisdom on that just on Biblical you know principles to finance he runs a big the largest real estate company in Fort Worth debt free um-hum and we really believe in debt free living and debt free car buying and debt free house buying and if we do take out a loan on a house in the future what we'll do is pay twice a twice a month on it and because you save a lot in interest just doing that yes and then you save a lot right if if if if and you need to be very careful if the loan is set up to have bimonthly they call it a yuppie loan if it's set up for bimonthly payments if you because you'll sa ve seventeen fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan seven i'm sorry seven to nine years off the end of the loan right right right and there are there is a local firm that'll actually if if like in my situation i don't have that because the loan was not available um-hum i can have this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee so i can cut that much off the end of but i'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year oh really yeah but uh those are all great the the interesting thing we're getting ready to have a house built uh-huh uh-huh is it's not a lot of the firms that offer mortgage mortgage loan firms aren't offering um that loan um-hum i mean you can ask and you can wheel and deal but it's not as open as it it should be it's a great idea hell i'd love to cut ours in half but uh man yeah um-hum and if you figure get with a financial person and you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan if you make like a four hundred dollar payment yeah over and above your house payment it'll make uh it has a magic with numbers it i it'll shave almost you know X number of dollars off um-hum right yeah we real we've become aware of that we have a there's a loan officer through our church too that i think could help us better you know he does that full time with the bank you know um-hum and so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity so sure you know that is another thing that you know we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time we buy a car we're not just going to go to Toyota of Irving you know we're going to go to somebody that we know we're going to take someone with us older and we didn't do any of those things somebody you trust you know there are so many rip-off artists here in this town it's it's uh it's really a sin it really is yeah i got taken on some firewood on firewood really i mean uh uh the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood and my wife didn't know and i stopped payment on the check and he'd already been paid by a cashing firm and and they're suing us they're suing me on this and it's for a hundred and thirty four dollars oh my absolutely pathetic i stopped payment on a check oh that's funny oh this last week we bought a sewing machine at Zak's and then i found that you could get the same machine better for less locally not much less but it was enough less and i found they locally serviced it and we just stopped payment on the check so i hope they don't sue us over it but we never received any merchandise either so i don't think it would hold any oh okay well something probably something like that did you call them and tell them you just you just anyway no we didn't even call them we just did it maybe my husband should call today might be a good idea because because you're going to get what a a check uh  so do you have any credit cards yes i do i keep uh i have an American Express and a Visa card that i keep you know kind of for emergency purposes and i have you know i use a gasoline credit card which i you know pay off every every month um-hum but i've i've gotten rid of all of the credit cards you know that i possibly could and my balances are practically zero on the ones that i have okay especially since you know it's no longer after this year or after tax year nineteen ninety there's there's no deductions for you know credit card interest that you pay so it's a um-hum you know gosh credit cards run what anywhere from up to eighteen nineteen percent i guess yeah it's just a bad deal course there are emergencies you know that you you know probably need to have a card yeah i have one card uh-huh that's that's probably enough and i try not to use it but right now it's maxed out absolutely yeah it's it's very easy to you know to do that or you know to abuse it it really is it's so easy to pull out the plastic um-hum but we're trying our best not to not to add any you know credit card debt to our structure here yeah um i have uh the thing that that bothers me worse than the credit cards i think is uh you mentioned the gasoline credit card uh-huh i don't have that but i've got you know one of the the uh instant teller cards uh-huh that you can use for point of sale purchases and we use that usually to buy gasoline and it's just it's really amazing how quickly that goes uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i'm sure you're right i don't i don't i don't participate in that but you know a lot of folks do um-hum yeah at least with the uh gasoline company credit cards you have you know up to thirty twenty five thirty days you know interest free for it yeah but you know the instant thing may be may may be the way of the future to you know to replace checks and every other thing yeah that's what they've they've talked about it of course it eliminates any waiting period and God help those people who have to float checks occasionally because you won't be able to with that yeah it certainly does absolutely that's right do you get any sort of discount when you use a card like that no i see oh it was well they consider it to be the same as cash i see i see i well because it actually is yeah it's better than cash it certainly is yeah uh-huh they don't even have to deposit it it just goes straight in there that's right no returned checks or anything right yeah no i i understand it's becoming you know the popular thing to do we're not participating in that particular program at the moment and i don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to um-hum but uh i have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards it's just you know too easy to do yeah but i'm so glad he told me that when that they they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them that's right they paid them off and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them she said at least before she could use them she'd have to thaw them out i mean that's funny well that's a novel idea yeah that would cause you think a little while wouldn't it that may not be a bad idea but i'm kind of getting a little more leery of credit cards you know as time goes by unless you just absolutely have to now there are times when you'd at least think you do anyway yeah yeah i i want to still have just one just in case but i'd sure want to get the get it paid down and not use it for a while so we yeah yeah yeah that's right my wife and i really i guess are fortunate we're really not compulsive shoppers you know we we plan purchases you know pretty well you know watch for the best buys things like that um-hum but uh some people have a real problem with it yeah well our our limit is you know fairly low uh-huh and uh so that's that's one thing that's good sure absolutely yeah oh i've got another call oh i'm sorry it was nice talking to you okay take care all right bye-bye bye bye  okay uh let's see i i believe in the trial by jury i think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for uh payoffs you know briberies uh unfairness one-sidedness you know all those kinds of things and i i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent absolutely sure before you convict somebody i really i really agree with the uh innocent until proven guilty theory i think that's that's a good way to do it you know that's about all well i think i think basically we're in a lot of agreement uh in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs uh some kind of legal definition um-hum but for anything involving that a trial by jury certainly should be mandatory um-hum but there should be uh with our overworked uh judicial system it seems to me like there ought to be a means of of um not having to take everything before a full court you know maybe there ought to be some kind of of uh as as as an example where called a jury duty now um-hum really and and maybe instead of of uh just kind of blowing it off and just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do um-hum maybe we should commit to spend a week and during that week you're kind of an ad hoc let's hear about it group of i don't know twenty five instead of twelve um-hum and each each case is presented to that group of of twenty five and those cases are of lesser degrees of magnitude you know the guy was caught burgling uh and he had his pockets full of stuff you know when he was caught uh you know that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say you know your pleasure your honor right and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing but the way our system our court system works that guy's going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time yeah right uh i just think our system is overworked and we're starting to stress the true meaning of of right to a speedy trial yeah that's that's a good idea maybe this pre group of people could decide you know which kind of uh you know where they could go from there do they need a big lengthy uh twelve person jury jury or do they need a six person jury or you know those kinds of things and the degree of the of the you know the seriousness of it you know how is this open and shut you know like you were saying or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened you know a jury like that you know we yeah that's uh that could be a good idea to uh that could work you know kind of deltaing off what what we've been talking about here uh i believe that um-hum our we've we've become almost litigious uh society where we're everyone everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff and although we're supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers maybe we don't need to do that yeah uh-huh you know maybe instead of of being so quick to sue you uh if you have a disagreement with someone instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff maybe you need you and if you want to your lawyer or your your opponent need to go face this group of twenty five or a Judge Wapner like you know that they have on TV and let huh yeah yeah either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case and let's you know let's get rid of some of this harassment suing yeah right that right that's that's a good idea i in the Bible it says uh if you have something against somebody to go to them first and if that doesn't work then to go get somebody you know a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them and if that doesn't work to take it to the whole church so that's right off that same kind of principle you bet and if that's a that's a good idea if we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we wouldn't have half the yeah that's true that's true too but uh you know that whole Biblical concept like that that's true in a lot of our um you know the the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that it doesn't work on that but it's based out of that and uh so that you know that could work there yes i'd forgotten what that's called there's a a real name for that like the Judean law or something like that um what is that called the Judo-Christian ethic Judeo-Christian ethic well that may be right it's in there some place i think we both know what that we're talking about the foundation of our legal society yeah right right right uh to and too the that was sort of the the beginning of ye shall be treated fairly um-hum uh i guess the the Lord started out with we'll treat you fairly i'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what i say uh that's sort of the Old Testament version yeah that's i know i did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament where where there's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there's a loving Lord in the New Testament but that's a whole different subject really really really yeah okay well i i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge on on the legal system mine too yeah mine too but it's been a pleasure talking with you yeah same here what what part of the country are you from i'm living here in Texas oh okay in in Texas okay i was just being curious well that's quite all right okay yeah well i'm i'm from the Dallas area oh okay well that's that's neat well so am i in fact i'm at work out at Lewisville oh are you really wow okay well i'll let you go and it was nice talking to you my pleasure have a good day bye-bye oh you too bye  all right we need to discuss the voters yes on a national and a local level why do you think the apathy exists i blame it to apathy i i yeah um i i suspect the apathy is is due to something like people just feeling that that their vote doesn't count anyway i mean why why bother voting if um if your vote won't make a difference so for instance in um the last presidential election i'm sure a lot of people thought oh Bush is going to win either way why bother voting why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter that's right i think that's and and the other side of the coin is um people saying well if i really like the underdog candidate i still think they're not going to win so some are saying Dukakis is certainly not going to win why bother voting for him so i think i i think that's a big uh a big a big reason for it how about oh i think so too and i think the other thing is the news media media puts such a blitz on it that they've uh had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting you know um that's true actually i never thought about that that that's a good reason and i i think the you hear the news you know you start out in the morning and all day you hear the news and by time say you get off work and go to vote you feel like it doesn't make any difference that's true that's true due to the overabundance of news we have available to us um-hum that what do you think on the local elections though i think on the local elections it's actually um i think um i think people vote in the larger elections because they feel like well you know the country's real important and you know if i elect if we help elect a president who's going to save us then the then the whole country will be saved but they figure local elections don't mean that much i suspect so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something figuring that you know um and i think wrongly figuring that that well what good is another mayor going to do anyway because our federal taxes are more important right now and you know and stuff like that so people think that that that they don't have um that that it doesn't doesn't matter as much whereas i think it's probably just the opposite is true i think it's probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level oh i think so too absolutely uh i think another thing and uh i'm making a judgment here that may or may i think it is totally wrong well uh i think that the people that are um have um a lower income which you automatically equate with lower education right tend not to be registered and they don't register and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time or when it gets down to the point of someone saying are you going to vote today they say well i would um right but and i believe in this but yeah that that's possible i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not going to count anyway you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under represented i i i would guess that that that portion of the population is massively under represented and i had an interesting comment one time a thought that would never have crossed my mind i had someone tell me that i will never register to vote because i don't serve on a jury hum what do they have to do with one another that's i i i just i that i just wandered off from that one i was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection oh so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever so they were if they don't vote they don't have to be on a jury oh i didn't realize that actually that there is convoluted logic for you yeah there is there there there are much easier ways to get out of jury duty yes just go in and say oh i want to be a juror i can spot a guilty person a mile away oh i just right right there are so many other ways but that one just it defeated me i didn't have any answer for that one that one was just beyond my imagination well that that just seems to be a person who just doesn't care about much of anything around sort of you know doesn't doesn't sort of likes rights probably but doesn't like responsibilities responsibilities no i think that's a good point you're probably right i mean that's that's what it what it boils down to is people like to say you know people say well i don't want to be on jury you know i don't want to serve on jury duty i don't want to vote i don't want to do this and that well then they could you know i put them in the reverse situation in the place where they don't have the right to be on jury duty and and they don't have the right to vote i suspect their opinions would change very quickly which and that was what i was thinking exactly about because in the Soviet Union they had an election and they had what like a ninety eight percent turnout yes a massive turnout at last someone wants us to vote they were standing in lines to vote yes they were they were doing that unfortunately what what they were they had they had no idea what they were voting on it turns out and their vote didn't count that's right but but it's the thought they all got out but you wonder if you know if if now the next election they have if only half of them are actually going to show up or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in Russia or any one shows up right that that's true total indifference you know what difference does it make back gone the full circle right now if things go the way that that that they are there i think that they'll keep voting but i think they'll wind up like us at some point where people sort of only half of them will end up voting and sort of caring enough to really make a statement so you know i think i think that that the people who most need to vote sometimes are the are the ones who who are really out to make a statement because you know when when when you've got an underdog candidate who represents something and even if he doesn't win a large number of people voting for that particular candidate does i think make a statement to everyone else oh certainly there's a message there even if they lose i think that yeah i think and i i think that's real important oh and i think women turn out to vote for women too that's probably true yeah yeah i think well i know it's true you see a lot of that you know rally behind the female she may lose but by golly we're going to make a statement here yeah hum that's good that's that's that's that's actually real good you know i said well well actually actually the the female who i would most rally behind right now right i don't know much about her politics that's about a way the way she makes speeches is a is a local person for you is Ann Richards oh okay i don't know her politics i just know that uh i saw her speak in the eighty four Democratic uh convention and right then and there if they said to me vote for someone for president i would have slapped down my vote for Ann Richards was was that the time no that was later eighty four that's too soon she said something about uh Ginger Rogers did did everything Fred Astaire did and she did it backwards in high heels that's very good she said that i didn't said you know don't tell me what women can do that that's that's that's very good that's i i like that so i would uh i would i would vote for her without and i i suspect she could get a large voter turnout i think i did vote for her as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure i did say i i i would think that um that that people like that i think inflammatory inflammatory politicians are um or or emotional politicians you know certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out i think i would hope well and some of the issues are so emotional um-hum you know some of the really the really emotional ones have you followed the Dallas elections on zoning no oh i've heard of it but not necessarily i've heard it's very controversial though i everyone has made so many statements i don't live in Dallas county um-hum but i've heard so many statements that i've lost track hum i honestly at this point it's it's just too blown out of proportion for everyone you really even the news you cannot follow yes what the story the actual facts are at this point i don't i don't really know if some of the poor judges that are just trying to decide how it should be divided um-hum that's what um-hum i wonder about them at some point hum hum hum well they're elected as well so that's correct so and that's another and that's another interesting question should judges be elected or appointed so they're going to be but that's that's true that's true well are they politicians well in some sense they they should be politicians in that you know you want them to respect the people and you don't want them to have you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge sure but on the other hand or you want to take the other side of it you can argue that's one of those you can pick either side and we could spend a lot of time on it because right that's right it's it's difficult um-hum it's situational really so how do you think we can get people to vote uh uh i've had one idea that i think is is is completely undoable but it but i think it but but i suspect it would work and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate who you never expect to win to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements so that a large population of of of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else so given a choice between you know so so if you have so if if imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes you know anti you know sort of um oh anti women statements anti Semitic statements anti black statements et cetera et cetera well then i suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote for just just to spite that person but i suspect that that that would actually never work hum well this is true this is true i was worrying uh along the lines of you get everytime someone puts in a ballot in a ballot box um-hum a dollar bill comes out the bottom that's an interesting notion that might work in some places that that that that that would be interesting yes i think that would work in some places yeah  all right all right what are some of your favorite foods i imagine with Argentina you've got some great foods mine well yeah well we got um a lot of uh European dishes well we got we got what some people call the best beef in the world uh-huh yes uh so it's uh Bishu like every Sunday you go out and you buy all these parts of the cow and then you just cook them over a grill that's like in our house it's already built in there's this whole special place in the back so that you can make a barbecue i've had i've had that meal in New York uh where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued and it's marvelous uh i have yeah yeah and then i have to find a place around here that has that well they have one in uh they have an Argentinean place down in Georgetown okay i'll keep that in mind yeah you serve that yourself or the for a family so um uh excuse me you ever serve that yourself when you have company oh no well see what happens is i'm only twenty two but like when like when i'm down at home and like somebody says okay when are when are we having this you know and i'll and i'll cook it uh-huh yeah oh that you know like you have to prepare the fire and then put the sausages on and then you know you put all these different meats which take different times do you buy them um separately at you know an American grocery store now or do you have to or you don't you don't go buy it from a a wholesaler no but uh what happens is in Argentina they have like all these little places like the fruit stand and you know the dairy and products and whatever and so little butcher shops yeah yeah i've i've lived in Mexico so i know and so they got they got the meat place and so you just go there and you can't find chicken there you got to go to another place to find the chicken yeah yeah yeah you have to you have poultry place what do you what other what dishes do you serve with it well basically it's what we call empanadas which is which is like right right meat turnovers yeah i the turnover the stuffed turnovers oh i love those uh-huh and uh then we also put sausages on a bun and then that's that's to start out with and then what you have is also like you know like three different kinds of salad yeah uh-huh and uh that's about it do you remember when you were in Washington Sam the Argentine baker uh no it used to be in Georgetown years ago he moved i guess he he retired and went back to Argentina i guess in nineteen the early seventies oh okay yes so that must that's before your time your parents might remember if they were here then yeah no we we were only there for two years okay i mean he was wonderful i we used to get the most marvelous empenadas and other Argentine things so yeah and uh what what i also eat now since i'm in college i have an Italian roommate and yeah i'm Italian are you and since being Argentinean we also have a lot of pasta uh-huh yeah well because there're many Italians in Argentina and you know like yeah and my mom you know like makes like what we call niokes and and all this stuff that it's just you know everything like lasagna and everything um-hum uh-huh yeah my grandparents my grandfather came to the United States through Argentina this was around the turn of the century oh okay yeah that's actually actually a little bit later like nineteen uh nineteen thirteen nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen at at one point one third of the population of Argentina was Italian like pure Italians yeah well i'll tell you it's interesting because when we cook here i'm of Italian descent my husband is Chinese okay so we and we both love European Continental cooking French cooking so we cook uh our meals are well we don't do we don't usually mix i mean that's well sometimes well if we're entertaining we'll do a Chinese recipe okay right right and um there are really easy recipe that is you know with Chinese you always have several dishes yeah and nowadays with microwaves you can steam many of the things in a microwave i don't know if you have one yeah yeah and if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it okay okay and chop some scallions and a little ginger okay and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done and it's a wonderful is it um flavorful piece of fish yeah because i was uh you know it's like when when you go buy fish you know like well like i buy like the fish that you can do in the microwave you know the breaded fish and you know i've seen you know the filet um-hum um-hum yeah buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish market uh the fish counter what kind of fish um uh any white fish sole is good um um flounder sole or flounder is real good okay so we put soy sauce and sesame and even grouper little bit of soy sauce and sesame sesame seed oil okay and not too much soy sauce uh some chopped up scallions um you know slivers of scallions okay and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes and if the fish flakes it's done don't overcook it though okay because i got i got um one of those little uh microwaves the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water yeah well till you just check it you know during and another quick dish if you like um if do you know what hoi sin sauce is it's that sweet Chinese sauce yeah no i don't well if you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin H O I S I N wait wait wait H wait ah H O I H O I S I N or S E N either way they'll spell it hoi sin sauce it's a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown S I N okay and if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork okay and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper okay and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce okay that you can serve over rice how how much uh how much uh how much pork do you buy for two people um well for two people um American uh if it's American style i'd buy a half a pound if you know we if you're just serving that but if you're serving another dish with it say the rice dish right um well with guys pretty healthy appetite i'd probably go a third of a pound and then you know you could yeah i could i could probably go half a pound and you can always you can always heat it up again and save you know so but there's there's just since i'm from Argentina i just love meat and we just yeah you can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables okay okay just stir that in and you've got a very colorful side another dish and how much does it cost um the hoi sin sauce oh a dollar twenty nine a can a can would serve would serve you for you know for quite a few um meals yeah oh okay yeah okay i thought it maybe it was like you know like five fifty or something you know oh no no no no no it's not it's not expensive at all it's one it's one of the Chinese cooking basics so oh okay yeah well listen it was good talking with you same here hope you enjoy your recipe all right thank you bye-bye okay bye-bye  okay um well the first thing uh what do you think you would offer as far as uh uh information about selecting a school well first i think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to what they want to do uh once they have that then they can start looking in uh-huh all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of uh of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer yeah uh do you do you feel that the first two years that the um depending upon the field i know there are some fields which a person should go to the school that school all four years but i know there are some fields where it's really not necessary yeah a lot fields are most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway it's it's your core education your general requirements general education requirements um uh-huh if you know if they want to get a liberal arts degree i don't i don't know what advice i'd give them go to the school you'd like to go to that's what i did yeah i didn't care about the program or anything else i went where i wanted to go yeah yeah what was your degree in uh political science political science oh okay well i know i know i'm going to school right now and uh i have a friend uh UTD University of Texas Dallas where are you at well yeah i guess everybody's in Dallas that i talk to i'm in north Carolina i know well that's where Texas Instruments is yeah right um something that i i think that i've noticed that i i have a friend i think if you're going into like uh law or medicine a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public um institution sure and uh it's a lot cheaper my parents my parents made a mistake in uh in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years oh yeah um and she found out after that she said you know my parents they just they really wasted a lot of money this is about twenty years ago but uh uh-huh well right now i just i mean as far as selecting selecting a school i i i feel that uh a lot of it depends upon the major yeah it does Um i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my my degree um originally i had planned uh-huh uh undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration And i went ahead and pursued that i i got as far as the thesis and decided To hell with it i didn't want it um-hum Um and from that point i went to law school and after a year and a half of that i decided i didn't want that either haven't figured out what i want to be when i grow up uh-huh okay yeah and so but i i i really did enjoy the law i mean that's that's where i wanted to be but i didn't want to go through the uh the hassle that the law schools put you through because i never did want to be a practicing attorney i just wanted a law degree uh-huh and i've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field because that's the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what i like yeah and you don't have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to so that's that's what i'm pursuing right now right and i'm pretty happy with it so far um yeah yeah i'm i'm pursuing what they what's what's called an interdisciplinary field i'm a speech therapy major and fortunately i have a lot of i have a good medical background and uh-huh yeah that's probably very useful yeah it's it's actually turning out to be more more useful than what i thought and um i also have a good languages background linguistics uh-huh uh-huh and some psychology so it's all working together the only field i'm not familiar with really is education which is required as well it requires about four or five different fields really yeah oh good grief so it's a yeah i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher but i i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while just to get my feet wet i said uh i couldn't do this everyday no way uh-huh maybe maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing um oh so you are a disgruntled graduate student i am a disgruntled i am i am just a disgruntled person all around i'm the uh i'm the uh original uh mister Scrooge i guess oh yeah bah humbug yeah bah humbug Yeah i just i i i think yeah there is i i i think uh law would be a fine field a fine profession fine field to go into um i know one time i was in a political science class and you know talking about fields people going into different fields i made an off off the cuff remark about lawyers about their integrity being questionable and i mean oh that was like a can of worms no probably you probably got everybody on you because they were probably all going to law school no there was a woman she said my my best friends are lawyers and you know all this and it was just well that remark in itself is a slam My best friends are lawyers you know like like uh my best friends are blacks yeah i know it was or or Jewish it used to be Jewish you know jewish now blacks and i guess i i guess Iraqi now is the yeah i know it but law law was a lot of fun until you get to law school and it doesn't become fun anymore yeah yeah i have a i have a friend she's studying she's going into law another friend going into law and that she's i i i'm really i'm really concerned about you know she's just going to be you know what's going to happen when she gets there you know all of her dreams will be dispelled yeah you going oh yeah Yeah if if if you've ever seen the program paper chase it's very much like that except worse yeah yeah it's i i think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful i i see i see that happening it is yeah very much so yeah it's it's a lot of that Um it it was enjoyable for a while yeah um but it's such a grind and you begin to wonder you know if if i'm not i mean you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer yeah to do it if you have any doubts whatsoever you better not get into it i mean i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard and i aged ten years uh-huh um-hum uh-huh but i i i wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world It never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law yeah i i went to a language school and and that was a it was a an i guess uh United States Institution it was i was military at the time and i i think probably the biggest huh what branch were you in what branch were you in i was too i was in the Air Force yeah yeah for myself i mean i think that military experience was fine it was just i just wish that there was something else that that that i could have done you know with yeah yeah well i got i got tired of the service after a while i mean it i had a terrific job really enjoyed it uh command post yeah yeah uh i was i was a linguist i was just wondering were you in SAC by any chance were you in SAC hum in TAC SAC uh no i wasn't oh okay i i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the uh R C one thirty fives no no i didn't i didn't go flight crew matter of fact i didn't make it completely through that through that field i was i was in intelligence school and about three weeks short oh i didn't make it i sort of washed out well that's yeah after about eighteen months of talking about the year and a half training you know it's it's something you know i think that's why you know children really need to uh-huh think about the field they're going to going into and i mean spend a lot of serious reading before they i mean not just thinking about they actually should do some reading and they should study it yeah yeah that's right and it and if it's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people do it yeah i i i i think i think there's a lot to be said for kids working after school i mean they they find out whether just how much of a people person they are uh-huh sure that's true i found that out when i was in high school i worked at McDonald's yeah oh and i tell you what i worked at McDonald's as well and i i can tell you one thing there are just some people that i you know you just came to the point where i mean and oh i eventually worked in a lab in a lab as a lab technician and i worked front desk and i mean somebody could walk in the door and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say yeah yeah i was the same way too i'm not a people person i i i hate um having to play such a nice guy you know especially when it's all phony especially when you got some uh jerk coming in yeah um-hum i it's just not for me i'm uh i deal much better in research and books and stuff like that uh-huh which is why i'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot um-hum yeah that's good i was just wondering um getting back to the school thing so i mean i i i almost wish that there was some  so what is your favorite TV program well probably my favorite TV program is Murder She Wrote i happen to be a mystery fan and uh programs such as Perry Mason and Ironside and Murder She Wrote and Columbo all of those uh are my my favorite kinds of programs yeah uh um i've watched Murder She Wrote a couple of times but um i like mysteries and i do like Columbo but there what is opposite Murder She Wrote there's something else that i watch i think it's that family home video show uh-huh well the that Famous Home Video is what's opposite it here i don't know up there but um i like that because it it really makes me laugh people send in have you ever watched that where they yeah no well i don't think we get it here oh they send in they do videos of funny things that happen at home you know and then send it in and show it on TV and oh boy i tell you what it's it's hysterical huh-uh oh what kinds of things do they uh show oh gosh well uh one that comes to mind is a lady i don't know what the heck she was doing in her dishwasher but she was in her dishwasher her head was in her dishwasher and her hair got caught oh my word and she couldn't get out and her hair it was and she was heavy kind of like me and so what you could see was this big bottom sticking out of her of her dishwasher and her husband was uh-huh say he was videotaping this thing you know there she is caught in the dishwasher you know oh it was hysterical and oh my word just real funny things you know people skiing and doing funny things on in the water and you know just really it's it's really a good program i really enjoy that uh-huh probably things that that there happen every day and we don't even notice them until someone videotapes them i know it and then some the winner the one that's voted the best wins ten thousand dollars so you know is that right i often think gee i wish i had a video camera because i could sure use ten thousand dollars so but i like things like Evening Shade with Burt Reynolds i really enjoy that and uh um-hum yeah i saw that for the first time yesterday in the evening i really like that that's a good show and i like Rosanne now i know not many people probably like Roseanne but uh-huh yeah uh i have never seen her show but after hearing her sing the Star Spangled Banner anthem i will never watch her show well she doesn't sing on her show but i i do enjoy seeing that uh-huh and uh so i like a lot of comedy stuff i guess you know but then i like the police things too Cops you know we have yeah oh yeah right um-hum and i like that you know so i don't know i guess i just like a variety variety of things and every day i just tape Regis and Kathie Lee do you oh yes that's a good program uh-huh do you like them i watch them every day i tape them well not this week because it's uh they're on vacation so it's just old tapes but oh okay but every i run my VCR while i'm at work i tape that and i watch it every evening when i come home and i don't know what it is about that show that's different about other talk shows well i think that they uh they seem like they are friends with one another and with all of their guests rather than just interviewing yeah and she's so cute and her and Frank and the baby and i don't know i just you know they took it off down here for a while uh oh gosh for about a year year and a half well yeah did they yeah i guess about a year and so i missed her pregnancy and everything you know and when they took it off i have never called a station before or complained or anything when they took it off the air here i called the station and complained i said uh-huh you took my favorite program off the air and do you do you think it'll ever be back and they said no we don't think it will be well that was channel eleven and now it's on channel four uh-huh so i'm really thrilled at you know that they you that they have it here so well great course i have to admit i i love uh when the fall comes i love uh football oh and i watch all the football games Monday night Thursday night and Sunday afternoon my mother does too i'm not a big i used to be a football fan i don't know what happened i'm just not a football fan anymore well and not everybody is yeah but my mother does not miss a game and you just don't know she lives in California and i do not call her on Sunday in football during football season i just don't do it you know she might call me during a halftime or after the game or something but i just don't call her and now they're starting up with new football yeah but uh i can't get too enthused about it yet it seems to me i have to feel that the fall weather to really do something uh with regard to football it's you think it's seasonal you think it goes with the season yeah i because i always hate to see it end in January i'd like to see it go on for a couple of months but football to me uh in real real hot weather it just doesn't uh doesn't click now i enjoy going to baseball games but i don't enjoy watching them on television and i don't enjoy watching basketball on television they're they're both well baseball's so slow yeah and uh basketball seems like all all that you can really see is run and shoot run and shoot run and shoot and um uh because the average person doesn't get to see enough of the entire floor to see a play get uh develop develop and so uh uh i don't usually watch them i'll listen to baseball and i'll listen to uh like the Indianapolis Five Hundred i would not go and face all those crowds for anything in the world but you watch it but uh but uh no i won't watch it i'll listen to it on the radio yeah while i'm doing something else but i won't sit still long enough to watch them go round and around and around to me that is very boring oh listen to it yeah yeah but i i don't watch i don't sit and watch for long periods of time anyhow now see in Ohio you really have four seasons don't you yes we certainly do well we kind of do but ours our it its hot here i'm in shorts are you and people have their air conditioners on already it has been hot and humid here and so but our summers sometimes start in June and they don't end till like November i mean it's hot so we watch football in the heat here um-hum sure right i guess so so i it might not matter Texans are real football minded people um oh with the Dallas Cowboys although they haven't done very well the last couple of years but uh they'll be back up there oh oh well i know i think so i think they did better this last year so yeah they'll they'll climb back up again and that Texas Stadium i've been there that is a phenomenal place yeah people say they wish they had a roof on it though it doesn't look finished well and i think that's maybe what i like about it in that so many of them are totally enclosed i've never been in an enclosed one oh i well i have and they're very noisy and uh then of course i've been up to uh Cleveland Ohio where the Cleveland Browns play and that's just a wide open stadium and that cold wind comes off the lakes and it is miserable oh but um now go down to Cincinnati and they have a nice stadium down there but it's it's all open also yeah yeah so Ohio has how many football teams two well so does Texas two yeah yeah and then of course Indianapolis which is only a hundred miles away from us has the Colts yeah that's right they have the Colts now like so uh they they've got a lot of sports going on around here yeah i went one time to um okay Minneapolis uh-huh to the uh Vikings i went to a Viking Bear game one year oh many years ago now my gosh it's probably been twenty years and that was a real experience because there are some fans there and i guess that's a big game oh yeah oh yeah well i uh i'm retired from education i worked thirty four years as a teacher and administrator in the Dayton here this the Dayton school system and uh several of my players uh players several of my former students uh played with Minnesota Vikings and then with the Cleveland Browns oh oh how neat yeah it was it was fun because uh they would call when they were with the Browns they would call and say we left tickets at the gate for you all come on up so we would hop in the car the next morning and drive up and oh we have tickets waiting for us on that's wonderful oh that's what an experience to see your students you know grown up and playing football yeah yeah oh oh sure one of them was grown up and was Chief of Police here oh that must be neat to see what happens to them like that yeah right when you see the ones who are successful and there are many of them around and uh makes me feel good to know i played one small part in their rearing yeah you sure did what grade did you teach or well i i uh when i first started out teaching it was uh at college level and then uh after we moved here to Dayton then i went to the high school level i really enjoyed that more and so then i taught the physical education actually uh with the i was the specialist in water safety and uh so i taught uh the the physical education oh my gosh and swimming um on the high school level and then they just kept pushing me into administration and and i wound up as an assistant principal and then i went down to the central office and was part of a team to to to develop a program to evaluate schools and and to uh try to resolve problems within schools so no wonder you like sports so you were a physical education teacher yes sure i was also a gymnast when i was very small in a Czechoslovakian Turner Society and and yeah and had the opportunity of uh competing nationally and oh that's wonderful they had things that were similar to the Olympics uh the Czechoslovakian Turner Society did so it was it was exciting we competed on the rings and balance beam  okay well now i'm from Dallas oh okay well actually i'm living in Dallas i'm not from Dallas i uh was living in West Texas before this uh which is a very dry arid uh-huh okay well obviously it's kind of a desert area right getting uh close to Mexico or um-hum real close New Mexico anyway all right and no and not the humidity i usually think of the South as being very humid well he Dallas is and that's since i've moved up here now so i'm starting to get a little bit of this but Dallas is i'll tell you uh considering well okay i've uh mostly throughout my life i've lived in in the smaller parts of of Texas and so moving to Dallas i was a little worried about the traffic uh-huh um the differences in terrain because uh you know Dallas is is a lot more hilly than it is where i i was living and i had just bought a new car and it had uh had standard standard on you know standard and i had never had a standard car before i see oh oh you have to get used to hills right so i mean i was real worried about you know having a lot of ice and things like that we just had a wonderful winter i mean there was one or two days of ice the entire winter yeah oh that's good i mean we had cold weather we had a little bit of snow here and there but i mean i couldn't have asked for better first year of getting used to Dallas and my car at the same time i mean it just worked out great for me oh that's good and what what is uh what is the temperature like down there now oh well today it was probably in the eighties um well yeah we've had uh we've had several days in the eighties in fact i'll tell you what last night i came real close to turning on the air conditioning i didn't do it oh that's pretty warm already oh is that right i didn't do it but i came close actually last year uh um about a week ago at the same time last um-hum last year um we had hit the actually uh nineties for about four days which is very unusual for this area at this time of year um what we're having right now is a lot of overcast i would imagine yes um-hum you know a lot of days with uh drizzle or uh actually we've had a thunderstorm But about this time of the year March blows a lot of winds here and it's a very windy month right um but right now we're in about the sixties which is is fairly comfortable um-hum well i heard the uh that um Washington DC has actually got the cherry blossoms blooming so yes we do they peak on Friday so if you have a chance to be here Friday or somewhere somewhere around there that that's the best time to see them and they don't last too long you know so that's hum well yeah that's i heard that yeah and uh then after after this month it'll quickly get get hot you know i mean March April May it has a lot of rain uh May has quite a bit of rain and uh um-hum by May we're hitting in the eighties sometimes even low low nineties uh but we don't really get the bad humidity here until July and August those are our worst months um-hum well that's that's sort of what happens here except uh we may start a little earlier and end a little later but uh yeah right right so is everything in uh bloom down there now is it warm enough i guess all the trees are yeah they've been they've actually been going at it for a good you know four weeks now i would think um um-hum you know in fact it's kind of funny uh you know you're watching the newscast i don't know about way up they are up there but the weather cast down here one of the things that they like to do is to tell you what's all in the air you know the fungus and the trees yeah well yeah oh right air quality index yeah but mostly it's you know allergy type index and it's been like like i said about four weeks now that uh they've had um multiple pages of things and you know of of names of things in the air and uh you know so that's a real good sign that that the trees are in bloom and the flowers are in bloom and stuff like that oh right is that like a pollen sort of a pollen count yeah yeah well we're just starting now like i said the cherry blossoms are out forsythias are out uh no tulips yet so we're probably a few weeks behind pollen count yeah exactly um-hum uh you know down uh that area being that south you know and uh um-hum that lasts everything's in bloom you know everything's green here till about October and then we lose it all yeah but uh i always wondered about the South i figured that there couldn't be too many months that that trees were were bare because it's it's hot most of the time well it's it's um it depends on what part of the south i think the farther east you go you know from from here on east uh you do have a a limited um-hum winter um now south of here uh like in Houston i did even though i said i lived mostly in the small towns i lived a short time in Houston it was winter yeah um-hum um-hum and you know the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties you know when it got down in the sixties you were cold down there i see oh okay here it's sixties and we're celebrating okay so there's that's the difference i remember being in Louisiana a few times and and it was uh yeah yeah that um-hum i think it was in December one time and it was probably in the fifties and rainy kind of weather but in the fifties and i was shocked to see people all bundled up with scarves and hats as though it were you know in the twenties because here in the fifties people have sweaters so you know i guess it's what you become acclimated to yes um-hum oh yes it's a big difference i have a one of my friends is from Kansas City and uh he has lived down here for like eleven years but he refuses um-hum to get to to where everybody else is i mean he will not wear long sleeve shirts he will not wear you know jackets and things like that i mean he's the only person i know right that in thirty degree weather still has a short sleeve shirt on you know um but it you know it's still not cold cold here compared to what he's used to so yeah yeah yes right right so uh yeah i i i like it better here i'm i'm uh formerly a Pennsylvanian and i have to say that i enjoy it that much better here a lot more sunshine and a lot less cold you know but i don't know about ever going that far south to live you know i guess you after a while whatever you get used to what you enjoy that's right um-hum well i think that's true yeah although there's you know there's you don't ever want to get too much different to what i mean uh i grew up with a lot of trees around and then i lived out like i said in West Texas where it's desert and there's not a lot of trees and that's the main reason i moved up here was that i did not i mean i hated um-hum right seeing you know no trees i mean it's just you could stand on a rooftop and see for miles and miles yeah i can understand that sure yeah i mean no i wouldn't want to i wouldn't want to uh go to a desert type of area either you know you get once you're in greenery you get spoiled by that you know well now that's that's not necessarily true there are people that are born out there that can't stand it here no oh is that right they they feel claustrophobic around trees i thought that was hilarious when i first heard it but i mean i heard it from more than one person so it's got to be somewhat true i mean ah that's interesting um-hum yeah yeah so i guess that once they're used to the wide open spaces huh that that yeah that that's interesting so exactly yeah i see i wouldn't have thought from the beginning but i've talked to so many people about it that it makes sense now i guess yeah i think i'll take the area with trees huh yeah yeah hum i agree i agree of course i wouldn't mind having an area with ocean but we won't get involved in that either right why am i too nice yeah that is pretty good oh but anyway well i that's that's about all you know i have right here on on this area so yeah yeah that sounds good um-hum okay well okay well nice talking to you alright well bye bye it was yeah nice talking to you too bye-bye  so um well i'll tell you my situation is uh i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home and um her son which is my father is also elderly and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years now my father's almost eighty my grandmother's almost ninety seven jeez so um it's strange because it it so hit so close to home but um um my father's an only child and really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother she had many sisters and a couple of them took care of her and then one her last sister died and it was probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home because i was pretty much giving up my life my sister was and plus she was driving my father crazy she went through three housekeepers live-in housekeepers so she's kind of cranky to get along with there's nothing physically wrong with her except she's very very old but her personality is is very grating i mean i hope i don't get like that when i get old so yes i'm i'm i have some great concerns about uh my my parents and my relatives reaching that age um around here where i live in Maryland in the Washington area there's there's and uh i used to live down in Dallas there was just so many stories about uh rest homes where the people are being abused where the people are being kept in filthy conditions in fact here in Baltimore they've actually shut a couple of them down and taken all the people out of them because they were so uh bug infested and rat infested and it i you know really concerns me that um first of all that anyone could let someone live like that but if you have to you know how do you make sure i mean i'm sure when you make your appointment and go by everybody puts on a happy face um you know how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is because once you put someone into there you know they may not like the fact that they've been put in there and they might complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the whole world they could be just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there and you know yeah you don't know if their complaints are legitimate yeah um we don't have that problem up here we might maybe in a rural uh maybe there's a bad uh a bad home in a rural area but it would be a very small one um the one my grandmother's in is very um hospital like there were some really nice ones here all the a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations um this one is more or less for someone who who's poor and can't go there and my father's is he's no by no means wealthy but he's quite well off uh-huh and he could he could easily have put her into a nicer um home but up here there's waiting lists and that was the first one that opened and i suggested to him why don't you change um he said well these people here are they are very nice to her and he was saying his excuses if you move her some place else the people might not be so nice so the the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing because it's a really trying job i mean i go up twice a week to see my grandmother and i know the staff very well so they couldn't they can't hide anything on you or anything like that but i have heard of really awful conditions uh-huh especially down the southern part of the state the country which is yes uh that's true my uh my grandmother's um last time my mother went down there to visit the the place where my grandmother was staying at was so overrun with roaches that uh she even had you know they went in and she had roaches crawling on her there were roaches even in her alarm clock um oh that's terrible yes it was absolutely horrible they took her immediately out of there and they just threw everything away that that she had from there i mean they wouldn't even take the uh the uh the dresser that she had that was her own dresser because it was just you know full of bugs they just left everything and uh bought her all brand new stuff and they they had called a home where they you know where they were on a waiting list to get into there and explained to the uh person that was in charge you know what had happened and that they had taking they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions and amazingly enough the very next day they had an opening and they they put her into that opening well that's good so is your grandmother um impaired is she of Alzheimer's or something like that i'm not sure um what exactly is wrong with her um up until nineteen eighty two uh actually i'm sorry not until yeah i guess it was around eighty two eighty three i found out i had a grandmother oh prior to that i was told that she was dead and um apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who um put her into a mental institution oh that does happen yeah and uh you know it was a real hush hush thing and then i was i was wondering why my mother always referred to you know his second wife as that hussy yep you know my neighbors across the street their uh mother was sick at times and they they couldn't handle her so they put her in a home and then uh the old Frenchman he'd get a little drunk look round at his kids oh you still need your mother i guess i'll look after her and and that what happens a lot when people are sick or they just real manic depressants they end up being put in homes and it's like oh well but that's it's it's i'm really glad that i come from an area where um yeah that there's good people in the homes but it's just as it doesn't matter if it is like you say the best place they still don't want to go to these homes and my grandmother's real there i mean she cries every day this has been over a year and she tries to make me feel really guilty but i have to you know i have to put my foot down where where my life begins i mean if that was my mother i would really feel i feel a lot more responsible i would probably take care of my mother i don't really um when my father when something if anything happens to him i don't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home and hopefully that he he can uh get along with uh in-house help so he he's going to probably hopefully set it up so that he will uh be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day because i think that's the best situation is when you're you get that old and you've been independent your whole life you don't want to go into a home because uh like i say my father's eighty and he's really active he still has his driver's license here i mean you wouldn't believe what he does he actually tows cars and as the years got on the tow trucks got better there easier and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one so he won't have to do very much work and so someone like that they i really don't want to see them go in a home he's got two little dogs that are his constant companions and he always replaces them you know i've had like over the past thirty years i've had you know about seven or eight different dogs all the time and there all you know it's like oops dad's got these two and the old one dies and the young one goes for a while and he gets another one so i can't see him without without his animals even though it's very expensive to stay at home yes mentally it's just the best thing for you i mean when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have you know and i'm thinking when i get older i i i think if i brought all my precious belongings with me i think i could live in a home i i don't want to be a selfish you know a burden on anyone that's what i think because i see what my grandmother puts me through and i'm and i'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place i mean and of course it's institutional food and everybody hates it and it's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight it it's really it's bad thing yeah but when they go into the homes they lose weight and like because of the institutional food you know i think it's fine but you know my taste um buds are pretty uh flexible and here they are they're always used to these old fashioned foods they're really set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home and now they're feeding them um quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat uh-huh yeah just they don't feed them the old people food the chicken and biscuits and things like that that's that's the thing my grandmother really misses i mean really growls about yeah my mother has made similar statements that she doesn't want to become a burden to the family you know just put me out to pasture or shoot me or something you know there are the lines that come from her and uh and i tell her you know no problem mom always got a place for you but uh yeah i know if if if people would think ahead of time and do things like that like build the the in-law apartment uh-huh and have it on you know one floor and really easy access well that's what i'm telling my father now he needs a new floor in his bathroom and i says now is the time redo your whole bathroom so you can get in and out  okay have you ever served as a juror never i've never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors uh-huh i never have either you haven't huh if you were uh what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers well i think it's a good idea i think our justice system needs a major overhaul and i'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it but i think they've got a lot of problems i think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial true and i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or or what but uh sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion yeah i think that's true hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides TV shows yeah do you would you prefer all trials by a judge no i think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty but as far as the affixing affixing affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature i don't know if that is best left up to the jury to decide to award you know two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing you know it's true that you know this may be sad and all that thing but uh the jury i think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of of penalties and fines and punishment yeah i would agree with that i think you're right i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company and um-hum that's true but uh i do like the idea of the jury being the the the people who decide in the matter of uh if it's a jail term versus life and death uh-huh you know the death penalty and such if they give them all the information i don't know when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff uh-huh sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave and right the judge decides whether or not they should hear it yeah uh it it it's kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in in jail right although you still hear about those occasionally yeah do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury um i don't know i you know i heard a very interesting and maybe it's just the TV show or movie i was watching they were going through a trial and i think it was like on one of the the documentary TV shows where they ask for the the verdict by the jury uh-huh and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent uh-huh and they took it more as just like a majority oh so i i some of them disagree i mean some of them said one way and some the other exactly but they took you know whatever the majority was so i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is i always thought it had to be unanimous i think it does have to be unanimous but uh rather interesting i know they can poll a jury make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was but i thought that they all had to agree or else they it was a hung jury uh-huh i did i did also and yeah i think i don't know how i feel about that i think maybe uh majority might be sufficient uh-huh it's hard to say though i what about in international trials do you think they should have a jury there i think that would be kind of interesting oh yeah i hadn't thought about international trials at all i guess the the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts right like you know the old day with the rack we they're going to say okay you're guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars well whose going to really make them yeah nobody yeah so but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know people from different countries uh in as international law also yeah i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street um-hum for something like that because of the cultural differences right things like that i don't know how what it would take to be come up with a true perfect system or if one exists but yeah what about uniform sentencing uh is that the crime and it's already false due to some chart and determine the punishment or right yeah like if you're convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years it's not a discretionary thing um-hum i think there should be a core minimum that they get but uh i guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature yeah i i wish that when they sentence someone if they're going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years yeah that serves a kind of if they're i guess uh if you sentence someone to life life is only forty nine years something like that you know yeah i and i guess you're eligible after twenty seven for parole even though you're in for life yeah and sometimes those people are are young enough they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble yeah although i guess it's your you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time yeah i don't believe that very often happens no because uh inside the jail there i don't think there's no real rehabilitation it just i don't think so either In fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad yes it's another war zone yeah but who knows i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know actually make them do something that's not pleasant i agree get them out there and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them and sure they should have them go out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state since the state is paying for them they should get some kind of kind of work out of them yeah yeah something besides license plates and tiddlywinks exactly yeah trading their lives for cigarettes yeah those kinds of things well good well i think that covers it i think so it was nice talking to you nice talking to you also um bye have a wonderful Easter you too bye bye  want me to press the one button i'm ready whenever you are okay sir Jack do you have any pets Jim Jim i'm sorry about that do you have any pets no no i do not i uh i live in an apartment okay well that would kind of preclude having a pet well well not really most of my neighbors hum have pets dogs uh-huh of course well we've got we've got a cat and this is a very very special cat because uh we lived in the Philippines for thirty months we worked for TI in in Biejo City in the Philippines and uh as you know uh the Filipinos are quite poor and and uh they don't uh generally they eat their pets uh well not generally but dogs they do uh so having a pet uh is is a luxury most of them don't have and we uh were able to find one that was born in a store and the uh a Filipino lady that ran the store was giving them away and we took him home with us when he was uh about three weeks old and uh ultimately my family moved back to Dallas and i had to stay on in the Philippines ten months after they went back and uh eventually i shipped him home by air and you know you have to really love a pet to spend two hundred and forty dollars to ship him across the ocean i agree and how they you know the uh the uh health officials let him in the country yeah there was no problem because there was a veterinarian in our neighborhood and we had all the proper paperwork and and i shipped him uh uh by air and uh let my family know when he was going to be in and they went out to the freight claiming area out at uh DFW airport and claimed him it was it was it was it was pretty interesting uh did you have any pets when you were growing up i always had pets when i grew up oh okay what did you have oh i had uh i started with a cat um-hum uh an old you know alley cat an old Tom but i had dogs primarily and uh um-hum um-hum mostly purebreds oh yeah but uh we had a large yard yeah and uh we did not have the pets in the house uh they all they were always outdoors yeah they they they lived outdoors and you know but i had a cat i have a i had a cat uh uh when i was living in in uh Pensacola Florida uh we had a uh cat that i got from again from a friend it was born in a barn uh it was they had a a small farm so there were lots of cats around um-hum so i picked out one and got it for my daughter and uh had it uh spayed and declawed and we did keep it in the house restricted to the uh first floor oh yeah and it was uh not a bad experience but for the most part i'm i'm reluctant to have animals in the house i just i just don't do not feel that particularly dogs uh i do not feel that they fare well yeah they're they're uh in the in the house and it's amazing how they how they adapt to the outside i was raised in New England and we had an Eskimo Spitz and he was never in the house a day in his life and i can you know i remember like this sounds like old grandfather stories but i can remember thirty five below zero and thirty inches of snow on the ground um-hum well i yeah i had a malamute at one time and huh and uh stayed outside um-hum i was raised in southern West Virginia oh okay so the winters would get fairly cold the only problem with it is that the bloody thing would sit outside my window and bay at the moon at night and uh you know it's uh wolf origins uh came to the fore particularly during the full moon and but i always had uh dogs i had a terrier first and then i had a uh let's see i had a terrier then i had a cocker spaniel then a then the uh malamute and then the last dog i had was a uh basset hound um-hum but they all stayed outside oh for goodness sakes yeah uh the only dog we ever had uh we lived prior to living in the Philippines with TI we lived in Malaysia and we were told when we got there that it'd be good to get a dog because uh there were a lot of uh breaking and entering and robberies um-hum and the uh native Malays by religion are scared of dogs in fact the lick of a dog is supposed to be something very very bad something very evil um-hum so what happened uh was anybody that had a dog at least the native Malays made up fifty percent of the population if you had a dog uh you wouldn't get ripped off by a Malay now the other fifty percent was part some Chinese some Indians and they might then they didn't have any qualms any qualms about dogs so we went down to the local SPCA uh the American association in in Gautolompora uh actually had uh uh an SPCA there and we went down and picked us up a little old female mongrel and uh and brought her home and she made an excellent pet um uh except the only problem is we played badminton in the yard a lot and we used to have to get the little shovel and scoop and go clean the yard at night before we went and play badminton right but i'm i'm a runner by by hobby and she used to love to get outside the gate and i'd put her leash on and take her running with me um-hum and it was only years later i read that you shouldn't do it particularly in the tropical climates where we were and when she came back she'd drink about three panfuls of water yeah i bet but anyway it wasn't it wasn't in the heat of the day i'd always go running about seven o'clock in the evening or something like that but boy she was ready i'd get that leash and she'd come over and start jumping all over me to get ready to go and and well the you know the last one we had the the uh my uh my father owned a plumbing and heating business and my brother and i frequently worked for him during the summer when my brother was in college and i was in high school and so uh this was the only dog that we trained to ride in the automobile and so we used to take it to work with us when we would go on a job pack it a lunch and it would you know get out of the car and find a nice cool spot to rest and my brother and i would go work and we'd come uh break for lunch and and the uh unpack the dog's lunch and so forth and the other workers the the carpenters and so forth used to get just a hell of a charge out of it because you know here are these two guys you know walked in with clean clothes you know every day my my of course my mother wouldn't let us leave the house without the clean clothes oh yeah you know with a dog and bringing a dog on the job an d they didn't realize we were working for my father so that uh oh for goodness sake it was uh but the people around here they're you know as i mention them the uh the neighbors a lot of the neighbors have uh pets um-hum of course they you see them out walking every evening but they range you know the couple upstairs that uh above me uh has a long hair dachshund right uh the lady is German but uh there are some huge dogs around here it's really phenomenal i cannot see i mean i've seen everything from you know Great Danes and German Shepherds and just really huge animals and how they keep them confined uh the the apartments are are fine they're relatively large but i'm sure to stay there all day is fantastic you know fantastic well we we we live in a in a in a residential neighborhood and the animals pretty well run a lot of people have fences in their backyards and and dogs are kept inside fences uh cat cats are pretty well on the run um-hum fortunately people are responsible and they've all been spayed or neutered so we don't have gigantic litters of kittens running around here but they uh it's interesting the lady across from us has always taken in strays and she's got six or seven cats and one of her cats somehow or other must have get into our house accidentally uh when the door was open and found where our cat's food dish is and he likes our food a lot better than he likes hers and when i pull my car up in the evening i can hear him she leaves her garage door open most of them sleep in the garage at night and no matter what time of night it is he hears my car stop and he's over here and he's forcing his head in the door when i open the door and i go in he goes in he gets a great big mouthful of food because he knows i'm going to pick him up right off and put him back out again and some days he'll follow me up the front walk so i'll run around the back of the house and try to go in the back door and he'll he'll go around and beat me there so i've got so that now i fake him i make a move toward the back so he runs around the back then i go in the front door so i i can i can get in without him but he's he's he's fat as a it's amazing yeah it's amazing how they get conditioned it it really is yeah he's he's he's he's fat as a little pig and she took him to the vet and the vet said you got to stop feeding him so much or he's going to die of a heart attack and so she said to me you've got to stop feeding and i said i don't do it intentionally i and if i'm in the house already sometimes i can keep him out if i'm trying to come in the house and he's trying to come in too i just kind of put my foot out uh against his neck while i'm i'm trying to uh get in the door and that works but other times i'll forget that he's out there at the door and as soon as i open it to go out he's by me like a shot and by the time i can get him he's got a great big gigantic mouthful of food well he might be canvassing the neighborhood you just might be the last stop on his uh on his route during the day no i i think i i i think he he likes our food best uh somehow or another our cat has become a housecat and he uh he sleeps with us he sleeps with my wife and i and either he sleeps across the foot of the bed on top of either my feet or her feet or above the covers and uh except when it's extremely cold and we don't get many days like that here in Texas  so what TV shows do you like do you like comedies or i like comedies and i like sitcoms i like to watch TV for escape i'm not much interested in uh-huh do you like uh do you like Cheers yeah i like that and i like L A Law and i like Thirty Something Cheers Night Court i like Night Court in fact it's on right now yeah i i think that's pretty much what i like is my favorite TV show is Cheers and then after that is uh Night Court but i also i also like Star Trek and that's kind of an adventure i guess you would call it yeah i never really got involved in Star Trek and i don't really care to watch movies because it's committing too much time i think yeah you know you never know what's going to come up you know if you commit thirty minutes or an hour to watch some TV shows it's a little different than yeah that's true you know two hours for a movie especially you know things that are i hate things that are continued yeah especially like uh have you have you seen that movie uh Dances with Wolves no i haven't you don't want to see it it's like three hours long and it just drags on forever that's what i've heard well i like i mean i like you know things that are funny and and all you know like like Cheers you know is really funny it it makes you laugh or you know so it's not like uh uh a show that goes on forever even though it's only half an hour i think yeah and it's a just a nice escape and you know it's something to laugh at and enjoy yeah something to remove you know something to remove me from reality for a little while get away from real life right exactly exactly that's that's what i like because i i mean i don't know it's just something i think something we need as you know as human beings something to remove you from reality to relieve the stress yeah and Cheers does it i don't know i like the way i like the way the people act in Cheers it's it's pretty funny it's it's kind of you know the extremes of certain characters yeah yeah you're right about the other you're right they are now that i think about it yeah i watch it it's on it's on here um like three or four times a night on various cable channels i'm sorry i think i must've i've probably seen every episode about thirty five times yeah the syndicate yeah they when they'll show one one episode in one channel and like the next day they'll show it on another one well yeah but right um let's see here they've got it they've got it at like six six or six thirty and then they have it again at ten and ten thirty you know on a different channel yeah and so you know where where i where i where i'm at right now is in a dorm and we don't have the uh we don't have cable so i just get regular TV but oh okay we see it uh every day at six o'clock uh-huh the older one yeah right and then the new one comes on at nine Thursdays yeah i'm trying to think what other shows i like there there's just television has changed so much and uh there's just not as many really good shows on i think as there used to be yeah i guess a lot of people think that the shows that i watch are kind of stupid and most of my friends and the people i know don't well how about the Wonder Years do you like the Wonder Years yeah i like that that's pretty good i mean it's it's not something you see every day so it's i guess it that that keeps the quality a little higher well yeah and what i like about that show is that the time the time period that that takes place in is exactly the age i was during that time period uh-huh so it's even closer to you yeah it's kind of funny to you know sit back and remember it brings back a lot of memories um i don't know i like do you like um i don't know if if you're you would know like Barney Miller do you ever watch that or the old Bob Newhart Show uh-huh i never ever really got into Bob Newhart never got into those the old i'm talking about the old one when he was a psychologist no i don't i don't i never never saw that don't remember those i don't know my friends don't like my TV TV they think it's trashy but uh well yeah i kind of i kind of stayed away from the TV for a couple of years when i first came up here so i you know there's a gap in my TV viewing but recently that's basically what i watch is Cheers and yeah and uh and Night Court because they're right they show them back to back back to back when i was in college you know we didn't have TVs and so i remember somebody happened to have one in their room it was a really big deal and everybody'd get together like one night a week to watch TV but i hate that span of giving you have to give up a lot of TV when you when you're when you're going to school lot of things you have to give up when you're going to school yeah but uh well sounds like we have real similar tastes we have tastes i mean as far as the sitcoms go what about the do you like L A Law or yeah no no i don't i don't particularly get into those shows because they don't keep my interest i've seen um L A Law i think once or twice and the episode wasn't that great so i just i figured they were all like that so i don't waste my time is that all uh-huh looking at that and you know and if it's if it's funny or if it keeps my interest if it's exciting i'll watch it if not i don't and times that i saw that or pieces of that it wasn't any it wasn't great Thirty Something i watched a few times because there was a few good episodes and then after that it it i just lost interest in it yeah um but i guess it's because it's not aimed for an audience of my age yeah probably not no i'm i'm in my twenties my early twenties and so i guess Thirty Something is not is definitely not for me about ten years yeah ten years down the road for you but um those are really the only two drama shows that i like and i tell everybody don't call me but other than that i you know i like i um i'm recovering from surgery and so i read and watch a lot of television so uh-huh i get to see just about everything yeah well that that way you'll you'll get to see all the shows and you get to really form good opinions on which one is really good and which one is really yeah but who cares about my opinion yeah i like the uh i don't know it seems like some of the best shows they take off the air one of my favorite shows was Wise Guy and they took that off the air what was wise guy it was a cop show oh but i mean i heard of it before but i never i never seen it yeah i have to stay up if i want to see it i have to stay up till eleven thirty and then it's all reruns and the guy that was started out in it isn't in it and anyway it's a long did you have you ever seen that that show they i mean they they trashed it before it ever got started but it was like i think they showed a couple of shows of uh what is it a Cop Rocks or something like that i heard a lot about it but i never saw it now i heard i heard it really sucked did it because uh it was supposed to be something like a show uh singing and like like a musical but yeah oh really like a musical like right in the middle of acting they would sing songs or something you're kidding no maybe i should have surely it maybe it would have been pretty funny i don't know i can see why it crashed i don't think it was supposed to be funny though you know well it was nice talking to you nice talking to you i guess you'll get to watch all of Night Court yeah i've missed the first ten minutes oh well i'll get off the phone and let you watch it then and good luck on your recovery i'm sorry i'm just teasing thanks all right bye bye bye  well how many credit cards do you have um i've only i've got about four maybe i try to limit them because i well one i don't use them uh too much and i use my Visa just for about for about everything and i pay it all off so i try not to i just use it for free money for thirty days basically sounds like we have no conflict we had for a while i was carrying one card and my wife was carrying a different one and since the slips all look alike uh you commingle them and then you get the statement and you try to sort them out and it and it uh it it causes more confusion about it i finally said gee this is kind of a waste of time and then when AT&T came along and offered a free one uh i accepted that and we've been using that one uh the interesting thing is is that uh the amount of money you can can run up on them i don't know do you know any people that run up big big bills i'm i'm you know i'm in the age group you get out of college and i think a lot of these people have them maxed out well did um were you able to get one while you're in college um i don't think i ever tried just curious because i have a son that's a senior this year and he's heading off with any kind of luck but there has been i've had a couple of ads for a for for to provide a card for a college student uh what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that um well yeah i i you know it's you know feasible i mean i know a lot of college kids who have them you know who had them but just depends well that that that i guess from the from the card issuer uh that since since it's it's in monitor the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible but it's yeah so basically if you want to take the risk yes it's whether the parent wants to take the risk it's your risk do you trust your your son yeah to to go run up a big bill and the thing is there some there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded i i'm i'm leaning towards doing it for for convenience uh-huh uh-huh i'd say do you know have one with you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something a convenience yeah and the idea that you know if he got in trouble there's some some ways of getting out and that he doesn't have to carry cash the uh i i like the idea of credit cards that uh i don't i don't i don't carry cash around and and uh i don't even carry checks around i let my wife take the checkbook and she writes the checks and i record them so it's uh it's uh it's but it's interesting that uh the people that can that can uh the amounts of money you can run up with yeah on on credit cards and uh i i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that they had run up he was making oh considered a modest salary for an engineer and he had run up uh more than a years salary in in various debts to and he wound up declaring bankruptcy but there it it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of uh well it was a combination of things he had uh there were uh-huh there were several credit cards and then there were several other businesses but uh i i guess what's interesting have you seen the uh the the the the ads where they're offering to extend payments on uh things like uh like the credit union's offering the the extended loan payment for your car yes yeah yeah i saw that the interesting thing about that is is that uh that that they're encouraging you to incur more incur more debt and well it's it's it's business and they're making money off that and they make more money if you extend your loan yeah and and it's so it's business so and you notice that they're they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old yes and so they've already shifted the risk if they assume that car then they just have to sell it themselves and they'll recover the loan and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely dire circumstances or anything they're not going to keep on if the car were older uh-huh the interesting thing about it is is that from a uh uh an economy standpoint or in economics i i thinks it's i think it's poor poor uh economics to to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint so yeah it's interesting that that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible and this year it's ten percent or so yeah uh it's uh it's interesting that that uh they encourage us to do things what now what's ten percent we can deduct i think ten percent yes of your of your consumer credit i didn't know that oh if you had a thousand dollars that means there's another hundred dollar deduction i've given you i didn't think you could anything on a loan or yeah it's on uh yeah i mean a mortgage i know you can yeah on the uh there's there's there's a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the oh i've never itemized yet oh okay so maybe that's it's on it's on schedule um schedule a or schedule a under uh well it's the same place it's the same place you put uh interest but but see that's what that's what makes Texas squirrelly laws that uh you can't you can't take out a a second mortgage uh like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that and so uh it's fully deductible the laws are a little squirrelly but it basically comes down to it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint yeah but uh anyway yeah i try i i really do i just try to stay out of debt and i and i use my Visa for for as much as i can and i pay it all off and sounds like you're you're very responsible very financially responsible it's uh uh-huh that's uh there're a lot of people who really run my boss drives quite a ways to work and he's got just enormous debts and he's uh but i mean what do you say it's like shucks boss i'm sure sorry you've got all that debt well he's had had two kids in college and and this kind of thing and that uh-huh i think that the whole credit card issue i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts and but i agree with you i don't i try to limit my debts well i did buy a new house last summer that yeah yeah and i took a five year note out on my car when i right when i got out of college and uh i'll never do that again i still got a couple of years on it to go and i'm it's it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car and that uh apparently that's been going on for a really long time i didn't do it i i bought a second hand car when i was the middle of my senior year uh-huh well you you think you're starting out well until you start paying all those bills uh apartment rent and yep miscellaneous things like food and and other things these habits you get into eating and and uh it's it's it's amazing how it what you learn yeah well yeah and and yeah so well anything else good to say about credit cards um yeah they're they're convenient you know that's that's a i might just probably one big thing about them and uh you don't have to carry the cash and and uh and it's it's it's certainly accepted more places than the places you know it's hard to cash a check if you're out of state and uh-huh yeah well i was used to using my credit card like at Skaggs Alpha Beta in Dallas and stuff and now i'm out here in Phoenix yeah uh they don't allow they don't do that they they none of these grocery stores take any credit cards so now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store which is new to me you know i got to have sixty bucks on me or something yeah huh so uh carry all that cash with you that was interesting cause i always you know you didn't have to worry about carrying that much unless i knew i well you know they they they've started towards a little bit of the debit card have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you yeah i've heard about them yeah and i think that's where that's mostly locally the banks will line up with uh yeah i've seen a couple although the so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the the time frame which they get paid in general that uh they i've seen checks deposited the very next day i mean cleared my account the next day my wife will write a check for groceries and you know almost well i guess it's the day after uh technically it's two days but they they they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float but apparently that's why the uh the uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high and they have uh the profitability of the cash flow is a big issue for them so yeah anyway well it's good talking to you all righty maybe we'll get across we'll cross paths again good night all righty take it easy  well i i don't think that it's it's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions for instance jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's where there's uh endangerment to their own life and other people's lives all right i agree with that people that are uh driving um-hum like uh truck drivers and things like that i definitely think they should be tested and and i'm not i'm not opposed to any testing i mean um-hum because i know i certainly wouldn't want to uh you know be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or you know because he was on drugs while he was there yeah uh well how do you feel how do you feel about uh companies drug testing prior to hiring oh um i was tested uh within my company i think it's it's it's kind of a push to uh weed out drugs in states and because i don't know of any other countries that are doing this um-hum and i feel i feel like it's really just within the United States it's um it's okay i think your record should stand for itself that you know if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever then i don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense of testing you over and over and over and once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and um-hum especially if your personality proves that you're not um-hum i think they could uh save money by not doing that you know every time say if you change jobs that you you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place well what about random testing though oh right do do you feel like that's an invasion invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested uh not if it's done fairly and that's probably my question is how how do you know it's done fairly i don't know that you do if it's random then it's random and that's not necessarily fair yeah well they might tell you it's random um-hum but then you know it's kind of like a a lottery somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything and tries and tries and tries yeah you know well i happen i know that for instance in the NC double A they drug test and it's not random oh i see how'd how did they how do they pick their people um well i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season and from that point on uh uh-huh at the NC double A does have something to do with it but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each individual individually individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem oh i see so do you and and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time right well do you think that should be implemented in the work place you know as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs do you think they should have the right to send them well not being a drug user i don't have a problem with that personally but i think that might be a violation of someone's rights if someone's to be tested right having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to have behave differently and their manager assumes they have a drug problem i mean if someone assumed that of me i would be upset right right right yeah it it would almost be like a a uh it's an accusation and and it's and it's based based on on uh perception that someone has of how a drug user would behave when some drugs users behave uh-huh uh normal uh you know right and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and you know your supervisor has accused you of using drugs right exactly it it i don't the i think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it's across the board from from the janitors to the executive management right i agree with that because i know personally myself i've been in the same job for three years it'll be three years in August and i've already been drug tested three times um-hum what type of job do you have well i'm an environmental engineer uh-huh and i've been drug tested three times and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime and the company i work for is sixty thousand people plus so see i i for some reason i've come up three times that's pretty high statistics well does your job require does your job require you to drive company equipment or to operate any type of machinery that might endanger endanger someone no no not at all it well it that doesn't i i mean i i it's a legal job you know uh-huh so see it's really strange hum that is odd i was drug tested uh not for the job i have now but for the prior job uh but i know that they sent that the job i had before that well the job i have have now requested my uh uh my uh medical record from my old company oh uh-huh so i don't know if i wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion right well does your the company say for instance does the company you worked for before before have the right or do they have the ability to say hey we've already drug tested her and and she came up negative well no i don't think they can they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that i i didn't i mean they they don't know that i don't use drugs they just tested me once yeah right right yeah but i used to work for a power company so it was very important that they make sure their employees especially linemen uh-huh uh were clean uh-huh and since i was just you know one of the office folk i guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly regularly uh just across the board uh-huh yeah and are they tested random no they're all of them are tested once every three months it's a rotation they're oh okay i see but it but again it depends on what job you're in the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot yeah and the men that drive the trucks with with the guys that fix the power lines aren't tested as much uh-huh uh-huh but but see they make that clear to them as they hire those guys what the what the drug testing schedule is they say we we're testing you tomorrow and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here oh i see uh-huh okay so they know that and they yeah it's it's made very c lear upon hiring uh-huh okay well well have we spent our at least five minutes okay yeah i think so yeah seven twenty five okay okay nice speaking to you nice to talk to you too bye-bye okay bye  okay it says what kind of car would you buy next what kind of car would you buy next well we've been thinking about buying a van because it'd be nice to uh pack the kids and the dog in and yeah a lot of people are you going to buy one of those minivans or you going to buy a full size well i don't know uh a friend of ours let us borrow their full size van last year we took a trip across cross country and it was really nice uh but they are harder to drive because they're so much bigger was the gas mileage decent or we got about eighteen miles a gallon oh that's not bad yeah it wasn't that bad and uh but they are big and they're kind of hard to drive uh definitely next car we'll get will be a used car because we can't afford a new car they're so expensive well oh i've never i've really never had a new car i mean i'm pretty young so but a lot of people they go out and buy new cars yeah you know i've i've been employed for ten years so i i have enough money to go out and buy a new one but instead i go out and buy toys and things oh um but yeah yeah see my situation's really different because i always had an older brother that always worked on cars and he got into business and he only worked on one kind of car is that right yeah and what happened is he his he had a business and they and they bought a lot of cars a lot of the same kind of cars what ended up he eventually had his own private junkyard which is terrible to look at very illegal but it was very cheap for us to run our cars because pretty much everyone in the family and there's seven of us kids would have one i mean me and my husband have the same kind of car my brother and his wife drive the same kind of car my sister has the same kind of car and my father has the same kind so it's you know when we get together and go places yes and we meet places it's like gee you guys don't like one kind of car do you it's a very strange car i don't know you if you have them down there but it's a Saab oh yes i've seen them yeah they're not that popular down south i don't i maybe it's something to do with the front wheel drive and they're supposed to be good in snow but they're very popular up here in Vermont and a lot of people used to bring his car their cars that might be i don't know yep to him to get them fixed because he was he was really good at it and uh he didn't charge as much as the dealer so and he also was really nice to people and that's the way to go he'd help them out a lot if they were broke down he'd try to go fix their car on the road instead of calling the tow truck so that saved them a lot of money yeah yeah one thing i like to do is is go to a police auction and get a car because i've heard you can get pretty good deals but you have to be kind of patient because you can't always just go in and get something right away like like like the Dallas Police Department has a car auction every Monday morning from like nine till twelve yeah i've heard that that's a really good way to get cars up here they they only come around like once a year in the summertime they have a state auction but but they don't um they don't repossess that many cars up here figure in a big metropolitan area there would be a lot of uh where they repossess they uh take their cars for illegal activities you know it yeah because Dallas is a pretty big area we got i don't know a million people or a million and a half people or something can imagine you have a good you have you could have a good uh choice of cars but then of course there's more people interested in them too that's true huh i don't know but i know someone who goes to Massachusetts and buys cars that have been wrecked or uh salvaged they probably they might have been stolen and yeah the insurance company buys them and they sell them and i've known people who have got really nice late model cars very cheap but but they have a dubious background they have salvage stamped on their title there's is that right yeah there one of my friends got one that the the whole underneath the car the frame was twisted hum and they didn't really know it it was a real nice late model car real pretty on the outside but they couldn't keep tires on it it kept eating the tires yeah but if you can get a good deal you know if you can save five thousand dollars five thousand dollars buys a lot of tires yep i know a lot of people who've boughten other cars the same way and and have done very well yeah one thing about i mean i the my car that i drive came out of um a salvage yard but i see see it wasn't um wasn't in an accident it had burned the whole inside of it burned the wire and cable burned and of course my brother being the clever person he was had an identical car but it had been in an accident oh boy huh huh so we took the wiring harness out and the engine and the transmission and everything else and we put it into the the the shell that was burned we had the shell all sandblasted and painted and he he pretty much built me a car so that's a pretty good deal yeah i was i was pretty happy i got what i pretty much wanted i could have had it any color i wanted i think the next car we get too might also be one of those uh import kinds because i don't trust American made cars now i don't think they have the quality and that's that's too bad because i mean i have to keep the money in the country but on the other hand with my money i'm spending i want to get something that's worth my money that's true but you know i always thought American cars weren't any good but i uh rented a car i rented a Ford Taurus and i was impressed i really liked it uh-huh is that right yeah and uh i was talking to my older sister the other day and uh she said she had to get a new car and they were thinking of getting something big enough she's got two teenage kids and they go camping a lot yeah and she was thinking of getting a Ford Taurus wagon she says they're not very pretty but like she was really impressed but i liked them a lot because they resembled the Saab when i got inside the door was big you know it wasn't it wasn't like a Volkswagen Rabbit you know i i mean it had a full size door handle on it and it was the interior yeah that's right was very plush and padded it it was just i liked the car a lot and when you shut the door it made a real solid sound yeah that's nice yeah and the performance it you know it it you could make it do anything on the interstate you wanted that's nice so i was really impressed if i if i didn't have have if i didn't buy uh used Saabs you know if i didn't have a father and a brother that help me out i would even think about buying something like a Ford Taurus as opposed to a Volkswagen Rabbit or a Toyota um-hum but that's one thing about cars my husband wants a Toyota pickup truck and i can't talk him into a Dodge pickup truck or a Chevy pickup he wants a Toyota pickup truck and they are they're very popular and i guess they run yeah uh-huh they they you they just keep running and running and running they have a really good track record yeah i knew a guy here had a a Nissan pickup truck and he had like a hundred and twenty thousand miles on it and only had to change the oil never had a problem with it yeah i know this this this person they go they have this old Toyota truck and he goes yep i say you know this thing's been running for me for two years he goes boy i wish i had the money to treat it right i'm like what do you mean he says i haven't tuned it up in two years and i change the oil about every four months because he can't afford to um change the oil as often as as he would like and he can't afford to tune it up yeah yeah so it it's amazing even when you abuse them yeah my wife's brother had a he lives in California and he had a Honda Accord i think and he had like a hundred fifty thousa nd miles on it and he sold it and uh never had a problem with it whereas i got a Chevette and it's the car's almost almost twelve years old and i got seventy one thousand miles on it is all and i've had problems with it just all the time all the time yeah well i i have problems with my car i'm not saying it's not perfect or anything but i wouldn't trade my Saab for anything i i bet now isn't that isn't that a Swedish car yeah or Norwegian or something it it's a Swedish car i'm just being stupid and sentimental it's just because it's about the only kind of car i've ever had i had a Volvo once you know it's like if i had to go out if i to buy a truck i could i could go out and easily buy a truck but i'd have a hard time going out and buying another car if it wasn't a Saab i don't know yeah well how did you like your Volvo um it was it was fine but it was an old one and um uh-huh it was pretty much it uh uh was something that i bought to resell because it was really uh it was a nice old Volvo and at that time i was going to college and i liked to go camping and bajaing and going up dirt roads and i was ruining the car so i sold it and i saved some money by buying a junkier Saab that i could beat around yes so it it worked out pretty well i've never had problems really getting getting cars it's it's refusing them because uh people always come to my father and brother and try to sell their old cars to them because they know that they deal and sell them yes my father's very shrewd with them that's that's a pretty good deal i always told my wife that if i had to do it over again i would uh have my own car dealership and used car dealership and uh she'd be be a travel agent that way if i needed another car i just go get it and whenever we wanted to go someplace we just get tickets for a real good discount and take off yeah that's a good way to do it um the thing about it is you got to you got to like to work on cars to be a mechanic if you want to be involved and that's a hard job yeah yeah it is well i you know i always dream of buying a new car but yeah i don't it just the money just isn't worth that that shininess yeah who can afford twenty thousand yes they're very expensive i mean even  it's it's hard topic topic because is it is it is it doing a good job or a bad job and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do yeah and are you talking about public schools being lower level high school level or well public school all the way up kindergarten all the way up to uh uh high school state school okay but you're excluding high-level education yes well yeah i am um actually actually i think that i at the higher level education i don't think there's so much of a problem there it's pretty much funded well there are small colleges that i'm sure are struggling okay but uh it's the job that the the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see in a area like ours our school even a bad school is a good school up here where if i lived in New York City or Washington DC uh i would seriously consider moving if i had a child i wouldn't let them go to a public school system there but of course people are trapped economically and they can't do that yeah i know down here the school's are you know i don't know they rate i moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio and the schools down here rate you know bottom ten percent across the country and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed half the time the teachers don't know what's going on well that's really too bad because it it it's giving some people unfair advantage i mean we our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida what we learned right well that was my experience going through junior high up there when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i'd already done yeah because we were so far advanced and uh the you know i'd been in a parochial school before junior high and you know even the public schools are behind the parochial schools yeah so you know i i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education you know you you pick a career path or you get counseling earlier and then you you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over oh they they have that down there that well they talk about it and there are a few in some of the more like in i live in a big metroplex and some of the the better parts of the metroplex the the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools but uh you know yeah it's like if if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some general business courses in high school right or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art you know there's no point in you know i'm an engineering student and if i have to go take art classes you know i'm not going to use them and through high school i could have gone so much further if i'd gone to a school that was directed yeah that's where i was fortunate i'm a i'm a technician and we had a vocational um electronics in our high school right in high school so when i went to my first year of tech school uh i had a very easy time because our high school had a a good program right i think the schools today you know the public schools are just they're just overrun you know they don't know what to do there's too many kids and not enough teachers and too many kids don't care yeah i find that that the that in the in the cities it's more less the kids go there and to socialize not really to learn and the parents send them there because they're supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that right that you can send a kid to school but if don't work with them as a parent i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage yeah and you know there's some kids that you know want to go learn but most of them just want to go play yeah well i could i could see if a kid doesn't have any encouragement if they're you know come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about trying to work and or maybe they're unemployed and they're mad at the world i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a a kid you know he's coming up will you help me with my homework and they're no get away from me i've had a terrible day so it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from yeah that's true i'm wondering with the boom down here it's well not at the moment but a lot of the industry's moving southward yes are they going to move to uh Mexico so oh i don't know about that but a lot of the industry up in uh you know the northern states is moving south and i'm wondering if that's going to have any effect you know on what you see now we're we're we're behind down here i say we because i live here if that might not turn around in the next you know fifteen twenty years yeah maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them you know if the industry comes yeah hopefully they'll promote good schools because i know the town that i come from the the uh the large IBM plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one and plus for for the type of student that's going to that school it's going to raise the level of the school right because your parents are engineers or chemists they're they're you're most likely to do better in school they're going to help you you hope yeah you hope well i think i i don't know i just think it it's it's a duty of the parent to do that i mean jeez my parents always helped me and i don't know it's just like you say it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in i can see some lady she's twenty one years old and she's got four kids a kid in her first grader i don't see where she's going to have much time for him so i don't know it's just like i guess you just have to wonder is it up to the is it you know who whose supposed to make the change the the state the government the federal government you know where's the money supposed to come from is it i don't know actually i think it i think it should be a civic level the city level and a a system level really to find out and to to see what they need and not overinflate it you know what what do you advocate more taxes or better management of what they got like if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back and you're getting raises every eighteen months you got to go hey now wait a minute we're in a recession here yeah we uh our town didn't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many many years just because people are are in the recession and they're even though we've uh enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years now we got eight percent uh unemployment when it used to be four or five people are going whoa yeah so starts hitting closer to home yeah but i always see it's all it's all money this like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime It it's it's all money based and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level and and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school who knows but maybe we do we need some more Catholic schools support the church instead they seem to have done a the good job in the past in uh some places uh you couldn't go to a public school it was miles down the road and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school so yeah they're a lot more strict yeah the i don't you uh have to learn you aren't given the chance to you know screw off all the time yeah i don't know if i would do that to my child though but so hum pretty much though see i don't have any good ideas or or anything that would contribute see this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont it seems to do a really good job well i know i'm in the you know the only reason i asked about secondary schools or you know advanced education is because down here you know going to the University of Texas the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school is it i i don't think i'm getting what i should but you know in Texas it's next to free because they they pay so much of it it's state supported but at the same time it's really not it's not like going to MIT my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of MIT and that's it's really too bad well that but that's i don't know i think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built you get people out of high schools and college junior colleges that don't have the background for an MIT kind of curriculum so well so you have to go to a lesser engineering school we have a very good public school up here and a degree out there means a lot it's a very good school it's it's University of Vermont um we also have some two year college well there's a four year colleges they all have a pretty good reputation but like you say you  okay okay what kind of hobbies do you have well if uh i like to do i like to make stuffed animals i i sort of have not been doing as much as i did you know before i had to work for real but i like to do things like that and uh uh-huh yeah you know bottle covers and uh-huh that sort of stuff and dancing oh the dancing i've i've kept up with because you know you don't have to well you don't have to get a lot of stuff out you know uh-huh what do you do well i sew oh clothes you know yeah that's like a hobby because i don't ever make anybody nothing but me or maybe little kids i've i've done weddings but not not not big weddings like you know oh wow um-hum big big weddings just bride's maid's dresses and stuff like that for people that i know yeah yeah you know so i don't want to be paid to do it because then it becomes a job and then it's not a hobby you know wow yeah and then it then it puts a lot of responsibility on you and a lot of stress too yeah yeah you know especially i don't want to do this and i don't want to do that so it's then it's not a hobby it's more of a job but i like to sew you know it calms me down oh well that yeah yeah i like to sew too but you know if i'm not in the mood to sew i can screw things up like you wouldn't believe oh yes and then i go ballooning yeah and then it lies in a drawer for about five or six years at least hot air no hot i go hot air ballooning oh do you really yeah in a hot a hot air balloon oh wow how exciting in a hot air balloon yes now that's fun oh i'll bet and uh well i don't i don't own a balloon but i crew for a guy he owns two balloons uh-huh and he'll call us up and say let's go and so we'll meet you know real early in the morning people think we're crazy because we get up so early in the morning but i love it yeah oh that's neat and i always tell people if you ever go up in one you just that's it you be hooked yeah and they're so pretty and you know is it is it hard to make it come down where you want to well you don't have a choice oh it just comes down when it wants to well you don't have a choice of where you're going so when you get ready to come down you have to you know you it's more or less like letting the air out he can land more or less where he wants to it's just that there's no like if he wanted to go one place he would have to know which way the wind is blowing yeah uh-huh right yeah but other than that that's the only fall back you know because the winds change he goes the other direction and and we we have to follow him around you know yeah well have you flown in one of those where they have a whole bunch that go you know like up at one time yeah that's just Plano they have Plano festival yeah how long have they been doing that uh let's see now i think we're on number eight or tenth we're almost to number ten i think because i've been here ten years oh well that's neat so yeah and then Mesquite is five they do one in Mesquite what about that one they do in Albuquerque now that's old that is that is the largest yeah that's the oldest one isn't it yeah that's the largest one in the world they they have over six hundred balloons wow um-hum how many do they have like at the Plano one usually about sixty it's it's getting larger last year i think we had eighty yeah yeah probably every year it'll um-hum more people get involved and stuff like that yep yeah but you have sponsored balloons you know like companies like Coors yeah because those things are pretty expensive aren't they uh yeah Oldsmobile they all have balloons you know um-hum the IBM had one last year now TI don't have one and Rockwell i mean yeah Rockwell they don't have one Rockwell whatever it is um-hum none of the major electronic companies have them but uh like Southwestern Bell 7-Up they have balloons yeah i had a friend at TI Detroit a long time ago that had one that a bank yeah you know had sponsored yeah now banks they sponsor different banks out here like Bank One sponsored one one year and i can't think of the rest of them but they they you know they have sponsors for certain balloons and all they do is just put the name of the bank or whoever's sponsoring that balloon that balloon yeah it's pretty good yeah and it looks so pretty when they're all you know when there's a bunch of them that way uh oh yeah and it's so peaceful we went out to Texas Stadium one time for a Boy Scout jamboree um-hum and we we was inside of the stadium like like i was thinking it the Astrodome um-hum and they filled it up the football field yeah and inflated all the balloons oh and it's it was so pretty that if you got way up at the top it looked like you could just dive off and and and bounce on a bunch of pillows you know it was good it was fun i had fun yeah wow sounds fun but that that's my that's probably my main hobby that sewing and reading books that's about it oh i like to read too what kind of books do you like do you really romance yeah i like those i like mysteries i like murder mysteries too uh um um-hum have you ever read any Dean Koontz huh-uh he's he's sort of it's he he's writes real good but usually it's the kind though that you don't want to start if you have to put it down very soon go anywhere yeah yeah yeah the he does well they're sort of scary you know but they're they're just really really good uh uh The Watchers you know they made a movie of The Watchers here not too long ago uh-huh and that was a book that he wrote that that was my favorite one it's about this dog named Einstein and this it was he was an experimental government thing you know huh uh-huh and they were trying to do like like robotic stuff and everything oh i seen that movie yeah yeah well the the book was just ever so much better yeah really yeah it was great i don't like i don't like scary books i can't i can't read those i get paranoid you like uh uh who is it uh Victoria Victoria Holt is that right yeah she's one yeah those are good i like those but i like i i'm a Danielle Steele fan oh really yes well that's i i have every book the woman's ever wrote really and two of her books have been on three of them's been on TV yeah and i got all three of them on tape and i'm fixing to tape this other one that's coming on Monday Changes yeah oh what what what one is that Changes hum and i had the book and i hadn't read it in so long so i read it the other day to see if i could so i can watch the movie yeah yeah usually the the movies are not as good the book is always the book is always better yeah you know but you know but because i know some of the stuff like that one Judith Krantz made that one they did that one really they did okay but i liked the book better um-hum it was good yeah that's usually the way it is um-hum sometimes they just change them completely yeah and you think it's the same but it's really not yeah um-hum like Jaws do you remember Jaws did you yeah the book was different from the yeah the book was a lot better i thought oh yeah but they just they just um-hum so what else do you like to do besides reading well my dancing is i i like to belly dance oh belly dance yeah you mean like those little thin in the little roll the bellies yeah i can't do that i've always tried to do that i've always wanted to though i didn't how people can get they stomach well you know it's it's real funny because when i first started it was like i saw someone at a Halloween party this lady was from Turkey and she'd been belly dancing since she was four years old you know so i thought well jeez you know that looks like fun i'll learn that in a couple of weeks ha um-hum yeah yeah you know i mean you could just you could just take lessons forever forever i think yeah right um course i'm tend to be a slow learner i guess anyway but it's a lot of fun and it's it's a good way to get exercise you know fooling yourself because you don't realize you're getting exercise you know it's so much fun you don't really think about it um and exercising i mean let's face it exercising stinks um oh i go to aerobics classes and stuff but i like that do you aerobics yeah i like aerobics are you do do you are you at TI in Dallas so so you go to the fitness center in Dallas no i go to jazzercise no oh yeah yeah i well the only time i can go in too and all these classes that are available are like Saturday oh really yeah Saturday morning which is you know i i go to those when i can oh they have them at night over here yeah well they have uh the they have them like at six um-hum you know here but i no we have six and seven no six and then one is at seven ten or something like that yeah um-hum yeah but i like jazzercise i like it better than aerobics yeah that's a lot of fun well yeah that's the same kind of thing like belly dancing you know you don't really realize that you're working as hard as you are because you're having fun yeah and it's sort of cute too and yeah i like jazzercise i'll tell anybody i'd go to jazzercise before i'd go to aerobics yeah yeah well see i belong to the fitness center so i feel like i have to go to the aerobics class to get my money's worth you know yeah i used to belong i i but i stopped that because i never used it yeah you know the the fitness centers so oh well that's a waste of money um-hum yeah well it's so neat because it's right there and i can go just right after work and you know before i get home because once i get home that that tends to be it so yeah i'm thinking about it my husband wants he wants to go to and sign up for the weights um-hum yeah and yeah that's handy and they're just there you know when you want to use them so but um-hum and they're open till i think ten um-hum yeah so yeah and i i did the family thing so my sweetie could go too i don't know um-hum do the weights yep he'll he'll he would never do an aerobics he'd die before he in aerobics class oh yeah but he likes the weights and the you know stationary bicycle and all that um-hum yep my husband likes the weights period that's it he wants to be up like he wants to he says i'm going to pump up i said uh-huh body build huh yeah because i'm always looking at those guys i love them um-hum but i always ask him how come they don't ever have no hair because i've never i think they shave it yeah they do and i told him i said well if you do it you can't shave your hair yeah and put i'm sorry i can't handle it and then then oil up i think um-hum they do and then i don't know how they get because normally they're not that pumped up and i  yeah so it's got to be the most controversial thing if you could pick on the list that's true oh we don't have capital punishment i believe you do yes we do oh we we have uh the death by lethal uh by injection yeah the the only thing about capital punishment is the i i remember someone saying i think it was a chief justice in this state he goes if you make a mistake how do you get the person back that's the whole his whole basis was if you do have that error you know some people have been in jail for years and years and years and they're finally exonerated and then you know if if there if you killed the person and it's like oops too bad i mean i think i've heard of cases where someone did they uh the they were uh it was capital punishment they were killed and they found out years later that the he really didn't kill the person what i believe there was one case i don't i don't know where i read it or anything but i think there there has to they have to have put innocent men or women to death before i mean i'm sure that that that have to has happened but then there's also the um number of people who have created or committed murders etcetera that have not been put to death even though they were sentenced to death row like like look at Charles Manson i mean he just happened to have the right timing yes and yet he although he may never be free to kill again there are a lot of people like him that are free to kill again i'm the type of person who sits you know it's the same thing about the war i'm this type person you you know you need it but you're the one who you can't you can't make the decision and go yes or no i'd be a terrible president because i would you know i knew we had to go to war and i knew you know it was the best thing but i didn't i would not want to be responsible for people getting hurt if you know if i don't know but i didn't want to do it huh-uh i don't think that i could sit on a jury and be part of sentencing someone to death well uh like i i i would find that too difficult yes but like you say there there's people out there that do such terrible things well i had one of the subjects was uh crime and it was talked about the the way society has worked out there's some people that economically trapped um-hum and they really their parents don't bring them up properly they have absolutely no morals because no one taught them correct i mean morals isn't something that's just in your heart and you're born with it you're something that's taught it's something that's taught it's something on the streets that you see so if it's a dog eat dog world it it's just really too bad that we have to have something like capital punishment um-hum but i i don't know how much of a deterrent it really is i don't think it's a deterrent at all i don't think that anyone that uh commits a murder actually thinks that they will ever you don't think it's a deterrent even uh be punished let alone put to death for it i mean look at the mentality of your average person who smokes cigarettes they don't think they're ever going to get cancer and yet it's written on every single package most people who murder someone don't even get caught let alone prosecuted to the to the extent of the law so even though even though you don't think it's a deterrent which i have a tendency to agree agree i mean it's a deterrent it's it's the ones like carefully thinking it out and stuff they think about it but a lot of the street crime that goes on and stuff they don't really care and they don't really care what happens to them i can see where it's not a deterrent right right i think for probably possibly the premeditated murders i think it's possibly a deterrent but yes for the for the gang violence the uh the street murders so to speak i don't think it is does it matter to you do you have a lot of violence where you live not where i live uh but i live outside of Dallas where where you work so is Dallas a bad city i talked to someone from San Antonio and the Barrio she said it was very bad the San Antonio has much more gang violence than Dallas Dallas does have um an area of town however the Dallas young men i mean sixteen to nineteen year old boys are shot and killed or shot at least shot frequently the uh the county hospital that handles all the gunshot wounds here yeah handles fifteen gunshot wounds a day oh jeez i mean a day and that's relatively calm city yeah it it obviously is not a DC you know yes it it i understand that Vermont's relatively calm oh it's very calm i mean you can our uh bad district i wouldn't advise going walking in there alone at night but you could and if anyone was bothering you you could make such a fuss where people would come to your aid even though you're in the worst part of the city um the only difference is that every street light is lit instead of every other street light so we're we're a really we're uh pampered up here um-hum um and when they do have a crime a murder let's we had quite a few years ago a young two young men they were sixteen years old um raped and beat and beat these two twelve year old girls really bad it just shocked the whole state goodness just how can anything happen like this and the guys that did it were so ignorant they didn't even remorse they didn't they didn't have any remorse for what they were doing but they were just so ignorant that one of them says well i didn't realize that was because i was beating her in the head that she was really going to die on me you know it's like although why did you do it she was screaming all i wanted to do was shut her up he he acted like he didn't even think that this was going to kill her i the kids were really quite ignorant about it and it it was a tragedy on both sides but it just shocked the uh the state that something like this could happen um-hum yeah i mean usually if something if someone robs in the night or something and uh a home owner confronts him i mean it's not a blaze of guns and stuff you know the guy might hit the guy over the head and people start running i mean if this happened in the city the i'm sure the youth would be armed and just take the family out um-hum i mean we're really fortunate to live here but doing these conversations it makes me feel really bad that there are kids that can't can't get out of the situation they're in and they're they'll eventually end up even if they want to be good kids they'll eventually end up uh more or less victims of crimes even though they're doing the crimes they're more or less a victim um-hum yeah yes they're the they're the victims of neglect and and uh many years of of perpetuated nonconcern for human life yes it's it's really sad yeah it's just it's it's just a lack of concern they don't have you know these kids the ones that are involved in you know gangs i think are searching for self-esteem and they find som ething like that in uh their gang activities and they never had this at home and their parents don't have it if they happen to know their parents yes it's it's it's bad sometimes the kids have no choice because the parents are are worse i mean it they'll do drugs in front of their kids they bring this boyfriends and girlfriends home in front of kids they they treat them like little slaves they holler at they hit them the other and they go they go to the gangs more or l ess for uh family oh this guys nice to me he doesn't hit me yeah the uh the we were shocked two mornings ago with uh the news that a forty year old man had sold his three year old son for forty dollars worth of crack oh jeez and they found the boy and the boy had been unharmed but they were trying to sell him you know they were trying to sell the baby or the boy and he's three years old they were trying to sell him on the black market that's stupid i mean it can you that that just repulsed me and it repulsed everybody that i work with i mean it you know we we sit up here on our pedestals judging but we're not there but it's just it is totally unheard of that you you you even think it would happen and it was just you know twenty twenty miles from me oh jeez yeah i know but it's it's it's it's real strange uh it's it's a world that um is the drugs are the drugs are going to get us all i mean drugs actually i think we're doing capital punishment to the wrong people i think we ought to have capital punishment for the true importers of drugs not the kids that are selling it on the street that don't know any better i'm talking about the people you know who are bringing it to our country i think they deserve capital punishment because they kill oh yeah well they kill a lot well then they wouldn't do this for the drug kingpin that they were going to um institute the death penalty other or was it life in prison or whatever for the drug kingpins i don't yeah it's it's so full of bullshit the the drug war is just terrible you can't trace it because a lot of the authorities are probably tied up into it i mean you know months ago it was the the military that's true  uh i guess being here in Dallas are you familiar with the Rangers uh somewhat they're not my favorite team i am uh somewhat familiar with them okay i see what team do you follow i follow the Milwaukee Brewers mostly i see basically because because that's where i came from and uh grew up following them as a kid okay okay that's interesting i guess really though i'm a native Texan so that really the about the only team i've ever uh followed has been the Rangers okay and uh uh what do you think Milwaukee's going to do this year well uh i don't think they're going to challenge for the lead in the east is that right uh they they've got a lot of uh rebuilding to do they traded for a lot of new players uh in the off season and it looks like it might help them but uh i think this is going to be a year for pulling together and looking for the future sort of a building season season yeah yeah uh-huh shoot the Rangers i don't know what the there's no telling what they'll do they'll probably uh they won't do anything until the all star break and then uh then they'll pick up a little bit and that seems to be their uh their average pace but well there's been some talk that they're going to trade Pete Incaviglia yeah uh i heard that but i heard on uh uh the radio this morning that that uh you know old Bobby Valentine said that there was no no uh truth to that but you never can tell okay they might just be fishing to see what they can get for him that's right and i don't know personally i'd like to get rid of him i think he's sort of a showboat and really hadn't produced you know a whole lot but uh yeah yeah i agree they're paying him too much money and uh for for the kind of money they're paying him right now i think it's one point six million dollars they can get a pretty good quality outfielder right yeah then they're going to have to spend some money and i think build up their pitching staff uh yeah i'm looking forward to seeing Nolan Ryan pitch yeah it would be interesting to see how he does this year but uh i think the rest of the staff is uh a little weak yeah i heard uh just i guess last night they got beat uh and Bobby Witt was the pitcher and he's supposed to be uh you know their their hot guy right and uh sounded like he got pounded pretty hard he's hot and cold yeah he'll have an outstanding outing and the next time he'll get shelled right and and that's really what the Rangers need some some consistency you know outer starter so and uh uh i don't know it's going to be interesting yeah uh my at work my boss got season tickets this year so uh hopefully if i'm real nice to him he's going throw a couple of those my way every now and then so it will be fun to go out there and watch them i see i guess Ruben Sierra's got an entirely new attitude this season that's what they said that uh he really worked out you know hard in off season and uh maybe he can catch a fly ball or two this year he claims to be out there to play ball yeah they say he's really been hustling right God he need to i mean he's got all the talent in the world when it comes around to to hitting the baseball never yeah but uh i mean you got to be a total player when you're in the pros well i felt a little guilty but not much when uh Robin Yount won the MVP instead of Sierra yeah the other year yeah but i don't know but uh Yount has been a he's a player uh year in year out and always uh is leading the team in uh most of most of their offensive categories is that right he really is a team player well that's what it takes to uh because uh yeah Sierra hasn't shown that kind of maturity yet right to to actually be a leader uh a team leader and uh you know the Rangers really don't have any star players besides Ryan that uh i think the other players look up to because Incaviglia i don't think you know uh he stands out to be a a real leader yeah and he hasn't really shown the the talent uh or the promise that they saw when he was at Oklahoma State right right sounds like they have a young guy that they're putting a lot of weight into uh that Juan Gonzalez yeah Juan Gonzalez yeah he looks to be a a up and coming uh performer yeah so it will be interesting to see you know i think and make him progress and uh get him on board well given the Rangers' history they'll probably trade him and then he'll become an all star and then he'll right somewhere else that that seems to be the way the Rangers operate that's right that's exactly right but uh well i'll tell you what it will be interesting to to get the baseball season going and see how everything turns out how do you think Oakland's going to do i don't know i tell you what they've uh they've got a big enough payroll they need to uh uh for what they're paying they ought to get they ought to get the performance out of those guys uh go back that's exactly right Canseco's making five million a year yeah and i i just don't see uh you know a baseball player being worth that or any really any pro pro athlete because we look at that compared to what uh normal people make i mean it's just totally outrageous yeah yeah i i agree and uh i think it is and when when the players themselves are turning down contracts that are three or four years in duration for three or four million dollars a year looking for more money yet yeah that that's what ticks me off about old uh Henderson you know wanting to renegotiate renegotiate his contract because uh uh he's not the highest paid player anymore sure well man that's that's just ridiculous well it's it's a bidding war between teams and it's also popularity contest between sports to see who can get the biggest uh paycheck right exactly and you know ultimately the the consumer and the uh fan are the people that have to pay for it through the because baseball that's true they keep raising the ticket prices every year right and through advertisements you know on TV uh because a TV contract is really where they rake in the money and yeah and with what those guys get paid then they go out uh besides baseball and and advertise products or they they charge ten or fifteen dollars for a autograph right that's right they've got all this supplemental income coming in as if they aren't ma king enough already as uh stars of the sport exactly and uh you know so i i don't know personally uh you know i'll pay keep paying whatever the ticket prices are but and uh it really does irk me to see those guys out there uh you know making that much money yeah and uh and then the the public you know just continues to you know help support and funnel the funds into uh to make it happen whatever it costs sure yeah i might get to maybe one game out of the year uh in person uh but uh having cable TV and HSE right well that's right you can get your your fill just about yeah i'll watch quite a few games on TV right especially to somebody like Nolan pitch right right so uh Brewers always have such hard luck Teddy Higuera is hurt again oh really he was supposed to pitch an exhibition in Mexico against Fernando Valenzuela oh yeah and uh he had a torn rotator cup oh jeez so he's out for at least uh oh i don't know how many weeks or months they said golly but he may not pitch this season again oh man that's ridiculous but he's the star of that uh team their pitching staff and when he sits out they fizzle that seems typical because most of their other stars uh Paul Molitor's usually out half the season with injuries himself oh man that makes it tough on the the whole club the management all the way down the rest of the players yeah they end up juggling the lineup and trying to fit uh more inexperienced players into those roles and they just don't have the leadership don't have the skills to carry a team yeah right right well it will be interesting well i think it will be fun i'm ready for baseball season to start i sort of am too uh i enjoy going out to a couple of the games and and uh i really don't get that involved until the play-offs though uh yeah i agree with that you know the season's just so long right well the preseason really doesn't mean anything either right because the players the teams uh usually play in split squads and they're either playing their rookies or their uh that's right depending on what night it is and where they're at uh on whose playing uh yeah and uh so once the season gets underway you know they're out there to be serious about what they're doing trying to win games and uh right i take it from there right right well i tell you what i appreciate the conversation and uh we'll just have to watch and see how it goes comes about okay well good luck to the Rangers this season see if they can pull one out all righty we'll we'll talk to you later bye-bye all right sure thanks bye  well Bonny yeah how do you do your budget well we take the rent first you know we need to have a roof over our head uh-huh and then we take the car you know we need a car to get back and forth to work yeah and then it's the utilities and then the food uh and then uh the regular bills you know your credit cards and your uh utilities and stuff like that yeah yeah uh i i'm trying to think what else phone the phone utilities come last or uh before let's see the utilities come before the food and the bills the uh credit card you know the credit cards and what else is there that we pay you know we got loans uh-huh things like that they come before the uh uh they come after everything else huh they're last on it because you know uh they they're never late but they're the least uh bothersome uh bothersome to us you know uh we need a roof and all that before we need anything else yeah i kind of think you ought to make make them wait until the last possible minute for it yeah we do ours uh fairly similar course uh we both have married before and uh so what what we do is kind of divide up the bills based on who makes the most money yeah and whoever makes the most money course takes the most you know the biggest part of the bills yeah well i'm a homemaker myself so he he brings home the money and we just divvy it up the way it uh should be and or the way whatever way we can i wish we could do that unfortunately between two divorces it kind of it kind of taps you out pretty good i can imagine i uh you know i haven't gone through a divorce myself i've only been married once but uh i know a lot of people that have and a lot of them's got alimony and child support and all that oh yeah it that takes a big hunk out of your budget it costs me about uh three thousand dollars a year for child support yeah i bet which is after i mean that's net that's right after i pay the taxes and stuff on it well that's better than having them living with you yeah they're more expensive right there day in and day out that's what i hear although although i kind of miss some of that stuff yeah i bet you do yeah but you know you know bills wise uh we kind of divide everything up and i take i take the bigger portion of it and uh my wife takes some of hers and we have an agreement that uh if we're going to charge anything over like seventy five or eighty dollars then we uh we talk about it yeah oh well me and my husband unless of course it's uh it's like for a present or whatever yeah and we have snuck some pretty good size presents in here i love it when my husband decides to say fudge with the budget and uh sneak a big gift in yeah i uh i was trying to finagle our budget around because uh my wife wanted she really wanted a little small five inch TV she could carry around the house or you know back in her sewing room whenever she's watching television i've got one of them and she wanted one so bad and we were just kind of short on money and so all through the year i i was putting you know five or ten dollars back fifteen twenty whatever i could spare i was putting back in a little envelope in there i was hanging onto it i thought God you know come Christmas time we're going to have that television set come hell or high water yeah and sure enough we got it well uh my mother-in-law gave us one for Christmas a couple years ago i don't think it's five inches i think it's a little bit bigger than that but it runs on uh car batteries and you know stick it in the lighter and runs on regular batteries and electricity uh-huh yeah so it's a neat little thing to have how how do you divide uh you just divide up your uh the money just you just make a deposit in the bank and kind of go from there huh uh well they have we have direct deposit that helps a lot uh-huh uh and uh first thing he does is we get out our clipboard we got everything on a clipboard from now for three months ahead uh-huh and uh you know he makes the same amount every week uh he's not it's not salary he gets paid by the hour but we know exactly to the penny how much he's going to get unless he works over and then it's uh-huh uh you know that's extra uh but he's got us situated to where we pay uh pay two or three of the big ones at the beginning of the month and then all the little ones at the middle of the month uh-huh and uh none of them's ever been late you know the ones that come in the middle of the month are early you know we pay them like two weeks ahead of time and uh uh-huh it works out real well uh most problem we had was when uh let's see when was it something like we had a three pay uh weekends uh you know it was a late uh uh the long pay period uh-huh and uh we was close to being uh oh shoot i'm trying to think it's been so long uh it was when he was in the military and uh it was something like four weeks in between pay periods and it really blew everything away uh we was close to being late on a lot of stuff and so that was pretty bad but i don't know i like that he's got it mapped out in the uh on the clipboard he's got a stable schedule then yeah everything kind of works out well yeah pretty much uh with the direct deposit that's what helps you know because he doesn't have the money in hand yeah if if if you don't have to go down to the bank for something you can kind of put it in there if you have the tendency to go to the bank you kind of well i'll take five or ten dollars here oh well he's he's we got that ATM machine and that and his bank is right there at his work oh and that's hard you know uh i'm sure you're familiar with TI up here oh yeah and you know how they got the Texans uh that Texans Credit Union uh-huh Tex Tower yeah right there he uh he's good at uh getting into that but he's good he's you know we never in my i i've been married to him for seven years and we've never had a check bounce that's good and uh well no i take that back one time we did uh it didn't bounce but it came close we called our landlord and asked her to hold off on check cashing the check for three days we was overdrawn six dollars that's not too bad that that's cutting it pretty close though so yeah but uh it was i don't know we've never he we've had problems meeting our bills before but uh we've met them well i think everybody has problems meeting bills now not too much you can do about it between the taxes and everything else everything goes up faster than the salary does yeah that's what's going to hurt us in April uh we owe on our taxes and that will hurt oh yeah so do we and yeah that's taking money that we didn't have you know that we had set aside for uh a bill or two and we're trying to finagle now getting ready for it because we got to pay them by April uh-huh yeah they want their money real quick yeah that's the only bad part we got the same problem however i guess it uh beats the alternative just not having anything to start out with yeah well i know how it is to start out with nothing uh you know oh yeah and uh i'm we're up to where close to where we want to be but we're not quite there yet well you get if you just keep trying pretty soon you make it yeah i just can i just think that i it would help a lot if i got a job but then i'd rather be with my kids well you know kids are important you got stay you have to stay home with the kids yeah well you know i've got a two year old and a four year old and uh well soon as they get in to school it won't it won't be so bad yeah but i know it would help with the bills well Bonny it it sounds like a pretty good idea yeah tell you what uh i think we about done our about five minutes okay well it was nice talking to you okay we'll check you later all right bye-bye bye-bye  all righty so uh do you think Russia's still a threat well i guess i'm maybe naive but i never did feel that Russia was a big threat to us i mean obviously there's the the the possibility of or was the possibility of war there you go uh but i somehow think that war is one of those things that that maybe is inevitable but uh i don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that that i think this question was meant what about you well i think have have you ever read the book nineteen eighty four yes okay you know like how uh these two there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other uh-huh right and you could picture it as being Russia versus the US during during the whole time and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them right because the people there could realize that they were the same as as themselves you know the prisoners of wars were were the same as the people living in that country right and you didn't want that to happen and to me it had always been that way i mean what happens is you have a government right and this government controls everything right yeah and then you have the people inhabiting the country and these people have nothing to do with the government itself and these people are the same as you are right right and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country supposedly US or Russia attacks a country it's not going to be within the borders of the US or Russia itself like i was telling people i'm really mad because the whole thing in the Middle East this was going on in Lithuania in Lithuania they they were announced to be a separate country but yet the the government that's in Moscow told its army to go in there and get those people and the US didn't go in there and try to save those people right you know it's like you're not going to go in there and say no listen there's a separate country why because you're going into the border uh-huh uh-huh right once you get into the border then there's a threat but what happens is you don't mess with us we won't mess with you but let's mess with the neutral countries uh-huh uh-huh you know and now it's like you know they're saying other people were were i guess other leaders were still crazier about it you know like other people you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there but Russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere uh-huh uh-huh and the US has you know it's like they it seems like they can their their army or whatever can can go in there quicker than an atomic bomb can and do do the job with uh you know less suffering uh-huh uh-huh you know but i think i think the thing is is that there the thing like they were saying they go you know like Libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button but not the USSR the USSR wouldn't do it right uh-huh because they got too much at stake uh-huh but i guess there was concern uh that Iraq Iraq would use you know nonconventional warheads with with the chemical weapons and things but yet it didn't happen i mean why not yeah well my my point of view to that is is that it would have had so much i mean the attack would have been so complete on Iraq if they had i mean the first you can imagine the first uh chemical weapon used uh-huh that would have meant a total attack of the Iraq country within you know three hours of when the weapon was shot oh so you think it was fear that kept Iraq from using it but yet the right and what happens is what happens is suppose they get Saddam Hussein which they eventually will he's got one less thing to go against him uh-huh uh-huh i mean if he were to use that he might as well commit suicide because he's going to be captured and you know uh-huh but the US also makes a lot of uh you know treaties with other people like saying okay if you give up then you can come live in our country and we'll take care of you like Marcos right right we'll overthrow you but yet you can still come live here you know right i don't think we've done that to Saddam Hussein yet uh no i think that's that's that's not very likely no but yet you know as as the parallel Russia is that Saddam Hussein is using the chemical warfare on his own people and i guess that makes sense what you said that yeah uh within their own borders they feel freer to do what what they feel necessary right right yeah and uh you know there's there's just you know like people will go like they like the U S goes and goes into Panama and what see i don't believe in war that's my thing i don't believe that anybody should die uh-huh you know and so then you know you have because what happens is suppose i'm i go to war and i'm holding a gun and i'm just looking at myself holding a gun and whoever shoots first survives you know right but that same person also has a family and you know his parents are going to cry and you know life ends there and to me that's ridiculous uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh you know i mean i just don't believe it i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't but uh-huh it's pretty hard to think that you know people are just going to shoot each other down and it's legal in a situation like that you know uh-huh well or that at that it resolves anything in the end that that negotiations couldn't resolve yeah yeah i mean i mean Saddam Hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous and he all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning so uh-huh uh-huh and keep his power but well uh-huh well it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the Soviet Union is a real threat to the US no i i don't think so i think uh they're getting they're especially getting their life back together now because a lot of things that you saw on TV a lot of uh inhabitants of Russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to a lot of like dancers and stuff like that right uh-huh they said that they wouldn't leave Russia unless Russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete uh-huh so it must be a beautiful country it's just that you know they won't let you get out and when you want to get out of the country that's what you want to do right right so oh well i got to go to class now okay well thanks bye-bye nice talking to you bye-bye  okay okay um why do you think it um failed do you think we should adopt it no i don't like the metric system you don't i i i think the country is is um too ingrained in the inches and and just the general um background the history of our country has been inches and i don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system um-hum it it's gonna disorient it and confuse a lot of people for years and years and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand um you know simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive and you know how far away something is and yeah it's it's not in our national consciousness to do it we've always measured things in the English system yeah and you know everything you know our land is in acres our people aren't going to understand what an amount of something is right yeah i agree i agree with you i don't think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system i don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the the disadvantages that would happen to the people of America yeah and also the um i don't know it seems almost like there's this it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations because i think they that's an area that the other nations especially Europe look down on us like oh we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system who haven't really attained it yet and i feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us and it's like hey we're content with this no it's probably not as accurate probably you know intellectually doesn't it's not as sound intellectually but like you said i mean come on i had six years of college and i don't know the metric system and i don't care to learn it and i'm not some kind of an idiot i just i mean it's yeah and it's easy to translate we have a computer for just about everything now and if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them it can be done yeah because i'm a mechanical engineer and i've had to work when i was designing packages for people i mean i had to to work both systems back and forth and it was not hard um-hum and you get you can get a CAD CAM system that can take any design you want and you can push a button and it'll convert every measurement on there you know from one system to the other in seconds right there's a lot of people like you're educated i'm educated my husband is but i mean a lot of people are flat not educated and if i have a hard time you know putting that into my life can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that doesn't have any college or i don't know how much of the you know but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population really yeah absolutely they don't have any college probably much at all and if we can't take it and use it easily well we how can you put that on like elderly people and oh yeah it's just you know just people that maybe just aren't blessed with as as much sharpness and mental mental acuity or or even have had the ability you know the chance to to go to college or to to to learn about it i think it's still good they do cover the system and i think it should still be taught in schools yeah yeah and they do i know now because i even when i was in elementary school years ago they were um-hum you know we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various you know basically the other alternate forms of measurements and things like that right yeah and and that's acceptable yeah i think it failed too because like what you said of just you know hey this is ridiculous i think Americans have so much stress on them right now because yeah i mean if you look at the average family it's like man they barely have time to stop and get gas much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and do all this and it's like i mean come on let's take the pressure off really yeah you know you need twenty gallons but do you need how many liters yeah and it's just like another thing the American family doesn't need any more pressure just leave them alone let them measure their green bean water in cups and leave them alone yeah yeah and it it just doesn't yeah it doesn't make that much difference in the average life in the scientific community and places where it's needed i don't know you know that's fine and the rest of the world i mean we are uh we if not we may not be the top i don't know if we're the top we're one of the superpowers of the world yeah uh-huh that's it may be arrogant but i mean let them come to us that's kind of the way i feel about it we can convert and and if they don't like the way we do it just get off our don't worry about it and i think yeah it it's kind of like expecting expecting everyone to suddenly speak German right it is because it is another language yeah you know yeah and and instead of having the world speak German we found out that we can translate and that's what i think we ought to do with the metric system that's funny well that's good well i think we kept it at real good okay is that all we need to say yeah i it's been nice talking to you you too i think that was good that was the best one usually i get distracted off the topic you know what i mean okay yeah and we'll end up one man was telling me about his grandfather in Lithuania and we were talking about something totally income tax or something and i just all right anyway the i appreciate it have a good day well good talking to you bye bye  yeah i just bought one so well that should be interesting okay you ready yeah guess so here we go what kind of car did you buy Ralph uh Mazda a Mazda how come you got a Mazda uh price basically oh price and uh what it all the things it came with for the price i couldn't beat it you couldn't couldn't find an American built car uh i didn't really look at American cars uh had a couple bad experiences with American cars huh just not holding up so uh my last car was a foreign foreign made car and it held up real well and the car before that was American and it fell apart so i'll be darned i just decided to go foreign i've had pretty much the i've had pretty much the opposite experience really yeah i generally drive a a large Ford super cab you know like one fifty or something and the one time i traded and got something different i got a little Datsun uh king cab it didn't last eighteen months i had had more trouble with that really hell it comes to trucks though i would probably think to go American because everybody know has got a American made truck they just seemed to be more rugged but uh the cars just seem to fall apart yeah i that's that's probably true i'm getting ready to i think i'm going to trade off the super cab and i'm considering going with either one of those four door S10 Blazers a four door Explorer or four door Jeep but i can't decide which one get out there and test drive yeah that's about the only thing to do i'm just i i'm looking for uh fuel economy and and durability and i've got to have some high road clearance we got some property and i need to get out in the pasture a lot but i don't need to haul a pickup as much haul around stuff in the pickup as much as i used to we got an old one there at the ranch we use now yeah but i just got to have something i can get out in the field and of course that truck is only getting like eight to ten miles a gallon maybe twelve on a good day and that just kills me right especially a dollar a gallon or more for gas i don't know how much going to how much better you're going to get with a Blazer there well those small ones uh those little bitty ones i'm going to go with the small one with the two wheel drive i don't really i i haven't had a use for four wheel drive tell you the truth they say they're getting eighteen to twenty in them yeah i've got a friend of mine's got a uh he bought a four door Jeep with the positrack rear end instead of the four wheel drive really he's getting sixteen to eighteen in town and twenty to twenty two on the road oh that's not so bad then no he's not really and he's not he said he's pretty heavy footed he's clipping along at sixty five or so around there when he can get away with it so i think i could probably stand you know twice the gas mileage it wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit i just don't know if i could stand one that small because i'm fairly large and i've always driven a truck or something right i don't know yeah i don't know i haven't been in the now ones that you know they look big on the road some of these uh they don't look too bad i just you know i i have have to get in one to find out i just don't know if i could stand you know being cooped up my wife's got uh three old cars of hers she's never sold a car she's bought she has thirty nine Chevy a fifty three and a sixty seven and anytime i drive any of those i just you know it's like being in a coffin i just feel hemmed in i've got to have something fairly large yeah yeah but i think probably probably my whole problem is going to be trying to find something that will that will blend you know uh fuel economy and and price and uh durability durability yeah if you got to take it out in the field you know the little those smaller trucks yeah they show them jumping over those ramps but hey yeah i know that's i think it would be fun if you didn't have to pay for the repairs to it yeah but that's what they don't show you when they get you know when they get them off they show them jumping up and down hills and like that but they don't show you the repairs right you know the front ends impossible to line up on mine last time i lined my Ford front end up it cost me a hundred and ten dollars so i don't know how you getting gas mileage in your Mazda have you had it long enough to know oh about uh twenty six twenty seven in the city it's a it's a four cylinder and it's kind of a sports coupe guess a little sports car but you do most of your driving you do most of your driving in the city you do most of your driving in the city it it does pretty good huh yeah i haven't even had a chance i've only had it for about three months i haven't had a chance to take it out on the road i'll probably be heading down your way in uh oh the end of May end of April i guess when school's out um well watch it coming down south down when you get through uh round round Georgetown and Roundrock they got a highway patrol that just patrols up and down that thing in those little fast Mustangs i'll have to keep that in mind because uh he just he just lives out there he makes his living on the road out there Roundrock and where Georgetown Georgetown or Georgetown Georgetown on down through Roundrock he just he just patrols up and down through that area now that's a neat little car those little five little five point oh Mustangs the fast ones oh uh yeah i i wanted to get a Mustang i wanted to get a convertible but the convertibles you know they tack on an extra five six grand oh yeah and it's like i can't see paying that for a for just being able to take the roof down you can get a sunroof a lot cheaper yeah it's probably more functional i don't think i had a convertible once in college and it was fun when you know during the warm months but God it was miserable during the winter i don't care what they say yeah it's like i got and plus the way crime is going around here in the city you know take a knife to it break in yeah and those convertible tops used to be three hundred dollars i don't know what they are now probably eight probably eight hundred by now yeah i'm sure they're yeah and you tack on the insurance they can add to it because if you ever roll one that's pretty much it insurance yeah you know that that that that and the windshield post doesn't stop much i had a friend that rolled a convertible not too long ago it was a BMW totaled the car he walked out of it though um you don't give those they don't give those BMWs away those are expensive machines um well think we about done our five minutes all right i got a meeting to get to so okay good talking to you great see you later bye bye bye  okay what is your uh general opinion then of of taxes for the Americans um i don't think that i'm paying too many tax you know too much tax myself yeah uh i uh as far as uh you know federal and state uh the uh the state i live in has a five percent sales tax um-hum uh it's quite a bit different than uh Texas i don't know if you've ever been outside of Texas but uh when i moved to Texas i was told oh well there's no personal income tax well they nail you on property taxes in uh Texas and then that's how they get their money to take care of the schools and things right yeah uh as a matter of fact they're talking about changing the the tax situation in Texas because the the schools are not they're not equitable within the state so they're changing that they're talking about changing the uh the tax base and how the taxes are distributed to the schools which will probably mean uh another increase in property taxes either that or uh starting a state income tax yeah i i found it interesting uh when i moved to Texas the fact that uh the reason people wanted to get their kids into Plano was to go to the Plano school district because it was the best because it had more money than you know other places and uh i just um in the uh like here in Maryland uh i just bought a uh a house for a hundred and forty one thousand it'd be about sixty thousand down there and um the tax basis is actually uh less than the full price of the house uh-huh so you end up paying property taxes on what they value the house at i think they only have the house valued at probably about ninety or a hundred thousand dollars yeah whereas when i was in Texas i notice that they put the tax basis at at almost the uh full price almost full value right yeah and so there was quite a difference there yeah um i think that the way they they levy taxes is a little bit uh crazy i think if if they uh people and and i'll use Plano as an example uh house prices in Plano were falling and so they decided well in order to get more tax revenue we're going to have to raise the price uh you know we're going to have to raise the uh the the uh tax per hundred dollars of value on the house um-hum and same time they were approving new starts in homes hand over fist well when you start having a large supply of homes then of course the price goes you know the value of the house is going to fall and the existing family homes were the ones that were falling the new homes they were building cheaper and and able to sell cheaper and so people weren't buying the existing family homes so right right they were shooting themselves in the foot and you know if they just would have thought well gee if we don't you know if we put a freeze on new home starts that will bring the price of houses back up our tax base revenue will go up and we won't have to increase taxes and make it more of a burden on people that are living here yeah i guess that's a possibility uh as i understand it Maryland does not have any uh state income tax is that right no no they do have state income tax oh okay so yeah that's and they uh they divide it up by um you know you pay a state income tax and then fifty percent of your state income tax is a county tax which is collected by the state and redistributed to the counties okay then uh all of your state income tax is deductible for federal income tax purposes that is correct okay did you live in Texas after the uh after they stopped letting you deduct uh sales tax on your tax return um yes i did i only lived in Texas in eighty seven and um eighty eight and uh part of eighty nine okay so so you couldn't deduct state income uh state sales tax when you lived in Texas no so what do you think about the difference between those two situations um in Texas i was oh i believe the uh tax sales tax was somewhere around seven eight eight percent um-hum here in Maryland it's only five um it was nice to have that uh you know deduction when it was available yeah uh but when they revamped the you know supposedly making things more fair um i've heard a lot of different arguments uh pro and con about whether we should allow deductions for sales tax or even uh maybe we should put more emphasis on sales tax because when you think about it the people that purchase more items are the ones that are better able to pay the taxes right you know people that are out there barely struggling to pay their uh house payment and buy food aren't going to be out buying you know anything else and the people that you know have the uh disposable income that are probably more able to pay the income tax uh or pay the sales tax are the ones that are really you know have the money and they're out there buying the items maybe they should be you know paying more of the burden um there was there's another crazy thing that gets me it's like the more children you have the less tax you pay and to me that is completely crazy and i have five children so i mean you know i uh i you know it it's kind of odd when i talk about this with other people because it it just doesn't make sense to me you're getting more services yeah yeah um-hum you know your children are going you know you've got five children in school instead of somebody that only has one or none and so you they're paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school it just you know doesn't make sense yeah that's that's an interesting uh interesting concept i hadn't thought about that how you you you know that that's right i guess in a sense i guess the you know the idea is that uh the more people you have in the family the more allowances you need you know the more uh capability you need to uh to pay for food and clothing and stuff for them so the they give you more allowances more dependent allowances for that um-hum but uh you know i understand what you're where you're coming from with the yeah now the other side of the question is about are we getting what we're paying for um for the most part i think we are but there is a lot of inefficiency uh both on the federal level and on the state level and uh hopefully we'll you know as we start to go into computerization and all the processes maybe we'll be able to streamline it yeah um i haven't kept up with uh the Texas politics other than that dirty little uh governor fight yeah but i mean uh we have a a governor here in Maryland who's uh pretty hard nosed and uh he's you know we're three hundred fifty million dollars short and every time he comes up with a plan to cut the money everybody starts screaming and yelling um-hum and uh every time he wants to cut one budget or do something else or try to do something you know they start screaming yelling they won't let him raise the taxes and and they they won't let him cut any programs and he's like what do you guys want me to do right i mean yeah that's i guess uh one thought that occurred to me uh is we're we're talking about having uh national uh military or or public service deal for young people um-hum maybe a program like that could replace some of the uh welfare programs if uh you know if we're going to do that then we ought to really get some benefit dollar benefits out of it that uh to reduce spending in some other areas uh you know to do something to eliminate what uh what they refer to as transfer payments yes because uh that's i think that's where our real you know the real problem with government is not is not what the not what the government's doing but where it's spending its money it's it's encouraging people to to uh not do as well as they can you know uh not have as much output and all that you're paying people not to work and you're paying people to have more kids and you know like you said you know more kids you have the more dependents you have you know the allowances you get and uh the more you have the more uh aid for dependent childre n you can get and all of these things go into it so yeah but uh some kind of a national service uh concept that might be geared around reducing that would be a i think would be a big step so yeah that and i think uh putting more emphasis on local handling of the problem i think this is something that that Bush came out and said in his uh in his address uh to the nation at the beginning of the year right um you know it used to be that communities would take care of their own and that you know the states would take care of the communities and then all of a sudden everybody starting looking to the federal government right it uh and uh you know once you start up at the top and try to get those dollars on down to the hands that need them you know there's a lot of places the money stops and disappears along the way right and uh maintenance and overhead and you know and and those kind of costs yeah right i i think that a a big part of the uh you know the government concept over the last fifty years has been uh redistribution of uh of wealth in in effect um-hum uh you know you you tax the people that have the most and the people that don't have anything get it for nothing yeah and uh and i don't think that's the American way myself it uh it kind of rings of you know socialism and yeah and i just i don't understand why the American leaders uh seem to think that that's the way to go you know that uh there are not i don't think that there are that many people that feel that way that with what they could get support for yeah or making the American system work in the way it's originally designed to yeah there there's uh you know once you reach a certain plateau in in finances um  do you have children my children are thirty three twenty nine and twenty five okay and i uh am spending more time with my twenty five year old because at this point he happens to be single and always has been single and living at home uh while he's trying to uh uh-huh uh-huh find a nice girl and get married they're little right right they're a little hard to come by so anyway he's still here uh that's a hard process isn't it the only thing i can say about the raising of these little things is that my sons-in-law seem to be so much more involved than my husband ever was or the husbands of our age group uh-huh uh-huh i'm kind of at the other extreme i have a nine month old and one that will be born in October oh how wonderful we had uh an October baby on the fifteenth May uh-huh oh really yeah that's when my nephew's birthday is and he goes well you should have it on the fifteenth so we'll see yeah well my husband's is on the fourteenth so we did miss that one day by a few hours there but we didn't care at that point so yeah at it's that close so do you find your husband more involved than your father was with you yeah i he definitely i had an unusual situation with in my home my father was was alcoholic but uh and very withdrawn at that and so my husband is ten times more involved and we have more of a um uh i guess a Christian based home and so we try to make the family as important as we can uh-huh and uh uh and i guess you don't have to have a Christian based home to to feel that way but that's just part of our priorities that's right it certainly gives you some some specific specific goals to work towards but uh Christianity doesn't hurt us any does it um-hum he helps a lot with her he helps feeding her changing her and playing with her and and i think he has to be conscious of of uh needing to spend time with her if not then he gets wrapped up in the TV and the newspaper and whatever else and he says oh i didn't spend time with Emily uh-huh uh-huh but if he forgets i try to to help him remember uh-huh and perhaps Emily will when she's a little older i think so uh-huh uh how do you find uh with an alcoholic father how do you find how what effect do you think that has on your life as an adult i think uh i've been reading a lot lately about the alcohol children of alcoholics syndrome i don't know if you've heard of that or not uh-huh uh-huh but uh trying to relate that to me and i think because i had a strong Christian background personally it affected me differently than it affected my sisters and i see myself uh with some of those qualities but with not quite as much anger uh-huh uh-huh as i see them towards him or towards my mother with certain things and uh uh-huh as far as me personally i think it made me appreciate my husband more because he doesn't do certain things that my dad did so i uh-huh uh-huh the reason i'm asking is because i have a dear dear friend whose father was alcoholic and at fifty she and she was an only child at fifty she's still still having a lot of difficulty in her relationship with her husband that she feels stems from how she was treated by her father uh-huh and how she feels that she has to control everything and from her readings she feels that that comes from the fact that her father was alcoholic over which of course she had no control uh-huh i think that's that's how i feel too i feel a need to dominate certain things and i try real hard not to be to too domineering with with Emily uh-huh because i don't want to my mother was also a domineering type of personality because she had to take over the things that my dad fell short in uh-huh and i find you know i think okay i want Emily to be this way and this is what i'm going to do to make her be that way and then i think no you can't do that uh-huh she has to develop her own personality and so sometimes i i have to step back and say okay we want to encourage her we want to influence her but we don't want to control her uh-huh and so far it hasn't been too hard but she hasn't been making a whole lot of decisions on her own yet and so you know i guess i'm i'm just going to have to be real conscious of that as i as she gets older and does start making decisions uh-huh and be conscious that i need to give her options but not make the decisions for her uh-huh and you don't feel that your relationship with your father has unduly uh influenced your relationship with your husband then um i i look at myself and i have three sisters there's four daughters in the family i look at myself compared to my sisters' families um and see that one of them married an abusive husband one of them married an alcoholic uh the other one married into a pretty stable relationship uh and mine is pretty stable or much more stable i think probably than any of them but now i waited until i was thirty to get married and they all married at eighteen but uh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh you didn't need to get away from home then um well my dad in his alcoholism he was kind of irritating and it there were a few times he was violent towards my mother but it was almost he like if he had any opinions to give he would tell my mother and she would tell us and so we had almost no direct relationship with him i mean he was there and and we you know did little things together as a family but on the whole there was no uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh no direct communication no show of affection no even no show of anger unless it he was you know really really drunk uh-huh my father my husband was like that but that was because he was working all the time establishing a business and running it certainly he i mean he got off work and he came home oh uh-huh and he ate dinner and his work was outside and in the winter time by the time he was warm he was asleep so it wasn't that he was uh-huh neglectful of his children by choice there just was no time and energy left for them by the time he put in his workday which started like at five thirty and ended at six thirty uh uh-huh you know alcoholism wasn't a problem resentment whatever was was not a problem at all because each one of our children was planned and he seemed to be the one who initiated having children so certainly he wanted the m uh-huh he just didn't have the energy to deal with them and of course now uh he's very excited he's retired and he's spending time with his grandchildren which shows how much he wished that he could have with his own uh-huh yeah i see my father relating much better to the grandchildren than he did to us so he has overcome alcoholism at this point not completely no he he still has a problem with it and he goes in stages oh um-hum but he still you know he will pick up my one of my granddaughters and say you know give her a hug and say i love you and the first time he said i love you to me was when i had been away from home for almost a year and a half oh but he said it yeah it i said i love you dad i miss you and then he said was able to say it back and and i was twenty four and that's the first time i'd heard him say anything you know similar to that uh-huh yeah the first time i heard my older daughter tell and she is our most expressive tell my husband that she loved him he said well i certainly hope so um so he but then he came from a background where he is so much more open with his children than his father was with him his father was just a very quiet withdrawn person and i assume very shy as is my husband uh-huh uh-huh uh he shows his feelings but he cannot express it and i think that's kind of sad in a way i see other fathers put their arms around their daughters or their sons and yeah we have two daughters and a son and uh he just can't do that and i i know that he would if he could and i i kind of feel sorry for him because i think he misses a lot and uh-huh as i say our our sons-in-law are so open and caring and giving to their children and i wonder if it's because they're there when they delivered they're delivered if that they went through that entire process yeah right if that maybe starts in the delivery room with a chain that my generation missed out on uh-huh i think too that with us as women being out of the home where i'm not working now i didn't work until about from about the time Emily about four months before she was born uh-huh and but so many women are having children and returning to the work field that the the dads you know have to to follow through or a third person has to come in and follow through with with the the care and the dads are are doing more uh-huh uh-huh and that bond is starting you know like you said right at the beginning and then developing it's not breaking at any point uh-huh at least it shouldn't and and and and in a good family it isn't unfortunately there's so many families where there isn't a father in the home it's just yeah that's right yeah uh-huh or a mother some of them the fathers are raising the children yeah so it's certainly not a good situation but i'm sure it's not one that the the the families chose i mean i'm sure they felt they had no choice at our stage in life we've seen uh-huh a lot of our friends go through divorces uh you know we've been married thirty five years and so that's how old our friends are uh-huh and they're on their second marriage and they've got his kids and her kids and i think my gosh all the pain they've caused themselves and their children i just uh-huh you know of course everything wasn't always rosy for us but you know we stayed together and at this point our children are saying gosh i'm glad you did that uh-huh so i think it makes for a more solid basis for them or i hope so at least yeah yeah they see you go through the problems and still come out okay working together um-hum and they see that with my husband's retirement a little over a year ago we're having a wonderful time and i think they look at that and and uh and that way i think we're doing a lot for our grandchildren uh-huh yes yeah well that sounds good my background is in sociology and so i see a lot of unwed mothers um-hum  okay uh are you in the market for a new car uh i've only purchased one new car in my entire life really right and that was back in nineteen fifty nine and it was a new Ford so the automobiles that that i have uh uh-huh first of all we have a source now we got a a friend whose a nun uh-huh and we've been purchasing her cars she buys a brand new car every three or four years oh really and then when she gets ready to trade it in she offers it to us and we buy it well well that's great so if you if you can find a deal like that yeah and uh we've got we've got a sixty seven Mustang that we bought brand new oh and we still have that oh that that that's a classic car so yeah it's going to be uh let's see next year i guess it will be an antique next year yeah but the problem with it is up here around there's so much salt on the roads oh really that it's hard to keep automobiles for any length of time because they all rust out and huh i bet that's right i bet that i bet that is true for down well down here we don't have that problem of course yeah uh every once in a while though uh i'll read a blip where you guys get some uh terrible ice storms oh yes we get and then but they don't put salt on the roads down there then they sand the roads and it just turns into a big mess ugh okay so uh but really the when it when it gets uh nasty down here it's like a big huge fender bender parking lot so i just try nobody nobody goes anywhere no one will nobody goes anywhere okay so how about how about you how about purchasing an automobile well uh a couple years ago we we purchased an uh well it wasn't new it wasn't new it was a a a an Astro van and oh okay we really like it because we got uh a two year old and another one on the way so uh yeah we we had a Firebird and we had to trade we guess we got to get rid of this thing because there's no way we can haul kids and junk and stuff with that so we got rid of that and we're really pleased with it yeah so what do you buy what are you looking for you look for an automatic you know you look for something with all the yes i can't drive a standard you can't drive a standard no i can't drive a standard yeah no i used to when i was when i was uh younger uh-huh you know but i've it's been long gone out of my system now i could just put it in home and let it go there and take me there and that's it i don't like any of that yeah but i do like comfort i like uh uh we have bigger automobiles now we've got Pontiacs uh-huh uh i like the comfort you know and and the mileage we get is depending on if it's tuned up or not we get between eighteen and twenty two miles to the gallon uh that's good we you know it's not really all that that doesn't it's it isn't as good as some of the smaller ones you know that they get a zillion miles uh oh yeah but yeah uh that's not one of my first priorities when i'm looking for a new car is excellent gas mileage look you what what do you look for uh ease of handling or roominess well my husband has to have a has to drive a pick up so that's so he has his he has a pickup uh uh he drives a small uh S GMC S fifteen which we bought we bought new five years ago and have had real good luck with i mean there's have absolutely no trouble with it yeah that's i i had a pickup truck in fact i had i had two the last one i gave to my uh uh youngest uh-huh uh because we used to go we we we uh built our home and we built it to we designed it to be heated by uh wood you know uh uh wood stove yeah uh-huh so and i like the i like the warmth and the comfort of it so every winter well i used to go out and chop wood and get it all ready for the next season so a pickup truck was handy for the work i was doing around uh-huh oh yeah but now everything's done so i figure instead of doing that i'll just i'll just order wood but uh uh i'm just like you gas mileage wasn't a priority hum it was it was comfort and it has to be has to have air oh yes so down down where you guys are down here it's a it's it's it's a necessity it's a necessity yeah when it gets to be a hundred degrees every day for a month and a half yeah that's i had i had gone down to Dallas couple weeks ago it's uh on a seminar for a week oh yeah and that's when you broke all the records was up to like ninety six yeah it was it's pretty warm eighties and you know when i left here and we're down to the thirties and twenties and uh-huh so it's a shock so i can see you yeah and you need air you actually need air now it gets warm enough down there for it so yeah i've i've in the car i've been running it uh uh uh uh because it but uh the the weather the weather's just been really nice but i mean you you just can't sell a car down here that does not have air conditi oning in it yeah like we're from Missouri and when we moved oh are you we when we moved down here the our uh the vehicle we had did not have air conditioning and we went through one summer that way and that was it that's when we traded it so that's that's one of your priorities there's got to be air has to be an automatic yes uh how about uh accessories power windows and all that oh that's not really important the the other stuff is just you know window dressing because we we've never ordered anything fact the the van that we've got we bought uh from an estate it was an estate trade uh it was almost brand new the the gentlemen who owned it had died uh so we got a really good deal so you got a yeah and it's loaded i mean it it i mean if i would have went to buy that thing new there's no way i could have afforded it yeah but uh since it was a state vehicle we got a really good deal on it but it so if you know if you know where where you're get getting your your automobile from yeah it's best to buy it that way because like our sales tax up here is seven percent oh it's it's eight percent it's eight here it's eight percent down there yes yes so who so if you go out and you're talking like a ten or fifteen thousand dollar vehicle and you add that sales tax on that's a that's a big chunk of change you have to come up with yes it is it and then we have an excise tax up here too i don't know if you have one every year down there oh no so they take the they take the uh whatever the book value of the vehicle is and then whatever your tax rate is and they just tax you every year on the vehicle or two vehicles yes it's terrible oh how awful and in our town we live in a like a rural area and they have a fire tax that they add on too oh how awful so so we've got to pay a fire tax and we got to pay you know two taxes sounds like you got a a little one there oh she hit her she hit her head now she's fine so oh so once you buy a vehicle and you pay you pay the sales tax that's it they don't tax you on it anymore oh uh property tax the city of Dallas but uh since we moved out of the city of Dallas we don't have to pay property tax on it anymore so that's what they consider property tax it's like like if you own your own home you have to pay property tax right homes vehicles you know everything has everything like that gets uh taxed property uh property tax yeah even if you you know if you don't own it yet it if you're paying off a note you still have to pay property tax on it i still have to pay it yeah that's just like up here too it's like that Mustang that we have the excise tax on it every year there's a minimum you have to pay and and it's only twelve dollars uh-huh so we've got an automobile that's that's got some class to it but i don't really i can't tell now what kind of a car is coming down or what kind of a car i'm following unless i get up close enough to read the name on it yeah because they all look the same yes everything look that's it i don't i don't foresee buying us buying an a a vehicle anytime in the near future because we're very pleased with what we've got plus i don't like anything that they've come out with yeah and if you take care of it i mean you can get uh some good mileage out of it oh yeah because of the the i'm driving a Pontiac now and it's uh it's a sixty seven Pontiac it's got a hundred fifty eight thousand miles on it ooh wee and it's absolutely gorgeous just i mean just glides along and i still get that good mileage and well that's great that i take it back and forth to work and then my wife's got a a an eighty four Parisian Pontiac uh-huh and that's a big car it's a V8 four door uh-huh and that's got uh a hundred and sixteen thousand miles on it and that runs perfectly well too well that that's great you got a hold of a couple of vehicles uh really good vehicles so when we get like i said you know the next one when she decides to to sell the car she has now i'll end up with the Parisian and my wife will have the newer one of course and yeah so we we just been doing it for years and years and years well down here if you want to go buy a used car it's impossible because they want just as much for a used car as they want for a new car and it it it just does that's incredible it just doesn't make sense to buy a used car down here yeah if you're going to pay the same amount of money and and you don't really know where it came from yeah then you're buying somebody's headaches probably oh you have no idea where it comes from you don't it's yeah and there's no warranty no none so whatever happens to it you're stuck with it yes true unless you buy it from i say somebody you know you know like from a family member or a like that one yeah  yeah well um i think the weather lately has been um a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year there we go i think that's true the uh the Bermuda grass is greening up uh in in March it sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of April so yeah so i think we're a little ahead uh ahead of schedule on that yeah i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon and i noticed all that grass coming up and i thought ooh we've got to start this mowing bit soon that's true it's been a a fun break but it the break is over yeah well um oh i guess another thing i've noticed too here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days it's been awfully gray you know just yeah now the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny yeah but it seems like every time at work i look out my window it's gray well yeah but i'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend so oh i go for that yeah yeah in fact i'm a little worried about this one coming up here we have a long weekend and it sounds like it's gonna be a little bit on the cool side yeah i hadn't heard whether it's gonna rain or not i think there's an eighty percent chance this evening but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow and then the rest'll be without rain well that's good but i think the highs are gonna be in the sixties and the lows in the forties that's getting back to a little bit chillier yeah that's probably a a little bit under what it is for this time of year i i think i haven't seen the weather the news the weather on the news in the evening lately but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy yeah i'm not certain either but you're probably right yeah well i like it when it's sort of a a medium temperature uh maybe seventy five to eighty somewhere in there i i don't like it when it's too cool or too warm i'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature yeah that's true um one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high hm and what that tells me is that the summer weather is very predictable that it doesn't vary very much yeah you're probably right yeah i mean any other time of year that's not the case because it could be very warm or very cold yes as a matter of fact i heard the weather the other day on TV and i think it was one day this week a year ago uh-huh they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather you know it wasn't just a super bad storm but it was it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the the late spring time right right yeah one of the weirdest things i saw i think it was around this time last year was a twenty six degree lightning storm oh wow i you know i was going into the grocery store and a a lightning bolt was almost directly overhead and it was twenty six degrees out hm and i thought well gee i've i've never known it to lightning at that temperature yeah that that is pretty unusual and you really take notice of it too uh that's right it uh it probably was a lot warmer up high sometimes they get those inversions like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing the air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees hm because the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away wow yeah i don't don't like that super cold stuff nope i just don't move very well when it's that cold yep i i'm really enjoying this now well this has been interesting yeah well not not too challenging to the brain not not a real in depth topic but enjoyed talking to you nope all right Ellen well you have a good day okay okay good-bye bye-bye  are you a player uh i like to think i am it's it's been a while now is it yeah i've uh oh just recently i got married and we bought a house we're about fifty yards from the golf course but unfortunately the house is taking up my time um yeah so it's been uh it's been almost a year i guess since i've actually uh swung a club for a purpose yeah i haven't i haven't played in about two years and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here i work at TI and i played in a tournament out there and i shot a net fifty nine they were kind of little upset yeah but i guess i laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits yeah yeah i have a hard time inventing shots you know let's go around this tree and you know try a slice through a hook here and i can't do that so i i finally got out and i've been watching quite a few videos i right right hadn't been able to play so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while and i i hope i'm on the right track you know i shot a career low eighty nine so and my handicap's twenty i yeah that's that's great yeah i like the no it's uh i could say it's been a while for me too i uh i've got my wife motivated about it um really and uh i think that's probably going to be one of our next investments is get her get her a set of clubs and uh we'll get out of the driving range and and get some interest built up and hopefully we can uh we can start in yeah i've tried to get my wife i bought her a set of clubs four years ago she hasn't even swung them but she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament the other day she's really well great great that's good she's ready to get off into it but you know i like i just like getting out being in the outdoors and i'm a hunter and a fisher anyway but you know i i you know at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf and yeah same thing here it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg really right right and i you know i walk i don't ride so you know i get a little exercise there too so um-hum yeah that's i've got the same attitude i uh i tell you i i started i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when i was in college yeah and uh i took uh took it as a PE course and then kind of left it alone for a while and then finally got got into it when i was while i was still in school right since then uh we've made it um as as the friends start getting married and things like that we've made a tradition of uh having a a Thursday or well have have probably like a like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding yeah and uh so it that's back in South Dakota where i grew up and uh so that that's uh that's been my main my main involvement is it seems like i go home and play golf more than i do around here but uh oh yeah eventually i get people to come and visit me in Dallas and then i'll show them that we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home yeah it's pretty nice we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not they were amazed yeah you know here it is sixty five degrees we're out playing golf and they're freezing cold back there so yep yep but i uh i i picked it up when i was in high school at on the same as a PE course and then when i got into the service i got into it oh okay and then when i come out here i just kind of let it go and then one of one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf i said well yeah you know i've got my clubs but i haven't swung them in quite a few years yeah and then i got into it and then back out of it and it it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there yeah that's right you know i really enjoy it it's really nice oh it is it's it's a lot of fun especially especially if you can find somebody that's uh that's got the same level of interest that that seems to be the hardest thing well about that's that's that's true of any sport you know if you want to play tennis or yeah yeah you don't want to go out and get beat to death but racquetball right and and people don't want to play with somebody that they're going to beat every time you know and and uh and no and then you know we've got some guys here they're you know four and five handicappers and they don't like to play with me because i'm too slow for them so um-hum right you know but get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time that's right yeah and i've you know i've never yet never yet have i walked up now i've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with and never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome you know they're always friendly sure come on out you know and they don't mind if you make a mistake they don't mind saying well you know let me teach tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or that's true that's true well you know it's it's pretty nice and friendly out there and you can't find that in all sports that that that's uh yeah that's absolutely right and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you right you you know you you get stuck you get in a rut if if you do play a lot but you play with the same people you you aren't going to learn anything uh after after a short period once you learn everything they've got to offer then uh yeah yeah you need to you know you've basically tapped your resources there yeah but uh i'd i'd like to uh eventually i'd like to work work up if if my wife does get interested and and maybe get involved in a league in a in a mixed mixed doubles league or something like that oh yeah we we have one down here in the summertime uh it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty or eight o'clock you know because it doesn't get dark until nine thirty or ten um-hum right and we play in the summertime out here we get a mixed league in and that's what i'm trying to get her ready for it's going to start well when we change the time back whenever that is next month i guess uh-huh and it'll start then and you know we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago and they were just starting to learn and you know they were shooting a hundred a hundred and twenty but they were sure you know now they're down into the hundreds nineties nineties nineties so it won't take her long right well that's good that's good that sounds like a lot of fun you know and it's something we can do together so well she doesn't do much hunting she could care less about that she does a little fishing but you know golf would give her the exercise she'd be outside give her something to do that we both enjoy so yeah yeah it it sounds like we've got real similar situations uh i i go home uh i've gone home every year now since i've moved to Dallas to to go pheasant hunting and uh yeah um-hum um the the last time i i took my wife along and uh kind kind of the same situation she sat she sat in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff but yeah she'll definitely uh she'll make the trip for fishing if we if that comes along but uh yeah all right it's uh that's interesting though yeah and it's you know it's a game that you don't like bowling you know you feel bad if you bowl a hundred but if you shoot a hundred in golf you know you don't have to be an expert to play any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right um-hum that's right um-hum so you know you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all that's right well yeah that's i've i've kind of formed the attitude that you know if if i could just if i could pick two or three shots out uh out of my game every time and put them together on one hole then i do pretty good and then and yeah i keep i keep rationalizing that well you know i i can do it i i just got to do it all at the on the same hole and and then it'll get better and you just keep going and in the meantime just enjoy what you're doing and yeah it it it really works that way and when you know when i first got back into it i used to get mad because i knew i could do something and i didn't get it done you know and i just well i need to slice this ball around here i naturally slice anyway um-hum now you know the ball'll go straight and i go i never broke a club or anything but you know i'd get upset about it sometimes and now i guess you know being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit i don't get upset any more so yeah yeah sure sure and yeah that's great well i enjoyed talking to you well you bet i guess i'll go back to work okay sounds like it all right see you later bud bye-bye okay bye  hi how you doing good do you do you have uh drug testing where you are yes yes we do right here at the at the very building they have uh a nurse's office uh-huh and uh i haven't my name hasn't come up yet how about you uh yeah i have uh what i've found out out of curiosity was my name has uh has come up twice and we've only been involved with the program say about a year right and uh when i when i first heard about it i was very uh very defensive i didn't think it was something that that the companies ought to be doing right because i felt that i was losing something or taking something away from me yes that's the the major issue i guess that uh yeah but now um now that it's happening i i feel comfortable with it i i don't feel as though i've lost anything and that i feel uh secure in that i know that everybody that works around me um is is drug free i have a a similar opinion at first i wasn't sure but then i thought it was a good thing for the company as as well how about how about where you uh uh we had a couple of people in our group who wrote one who wrote a huge letter to the editors um-hum saying that it's a violation of my rights and this and that and the tests aren't accurate and but i think they've got that testing down to a real science where you know they don't really you know i'm i'm sure you saw the video on how they do the testing and it it's almost impossible i think to uh to make a mistake well i was involved in uh in the in the initial training program because i had to go out and teach or explain to other people what we were doing why we were doing it so i i guess i had a little uh uh first hand knowledge of right of uh seeing the films i had more of extensive training in in uh background information of the reasons why they were doing it the cost that uh right uh that we projected that it that it actually cost companies by having people uh uh be involved with drugs who were uh right and that and that's a lot of money oh yeah and how do you feel about other other uh things like public uh safety buses bus drivers and and uh airplane drivers or or pilots rather you oh oh taking drug testing yeah oh sure i think that's that's i feel that you know for certain cases that i that i am willing to give up my rights to secure the rights of others i guess is what i'm saying yeah uh when the public whole is at stake well i then i'm willing to give you know personally i can't speak for others but for myself i'm willing to say okay you know if i see this is a right to if to privacy i'm willing to give up that right because i can see that it's uh public good is at stake and the company good is at stake and you know if they can get this thing under control you know it it's going to save us all money as far as benefits and everything else you know insurance and and and everything else in this country um yeah the the uh i've always felt that public people who are involved with the safety of other people should be drug tested i've i have never said that i didn't want that the problem that i had was right whether my coworker is on drugs or not has does not have an influence on my safe well-being right you don't work in an area where there's chemicals or machinery or or things like that but no so i had uh right and um they don't have any of that up here but you know um i guess it's just the productivity and the the number of uh uh sick days i guess and that they uh that they accrue well i'm sure that's still going to happen right well well i i think they would you know someone on drugs probably misses more work i guess that's why this smoking thing came out too um you know i've gone to those classes uh unfortunately for me i'm i'm a smoker and um i i saw the statistics that came out on uh smokers typically have more time out of work they're uh uh more prone to accidents and all of those other things and and uh when they're drive and that's why why i guess the car insurance has no nonsmoker rates or whatever as well for for automobile insurance i had no idea yeah that they were doing that i know that they originally talking about uh health oh yeah they nonsmoker at least down here in Texas they have nonsmoker nonsmoker they call them discounts uh-huh they give you if you're a nonsmoker i i guess there is some kind of studies that show but if you're smoking you're not you're not as you know when you're lighting up or something you know your hands both hands aren't on the wheel or whatever you're not as attentive um uh that's uh that's different i've never heard of that how about the um the the smoking premium out in Texas i understand they they started doing that that yeah i guess that takes effect in uh June July when June July yeah yeah that they from what i understand that uh notices went out to all of the sites right there was a lot of uh controversy about that too i'm not a i'm not a smoker myself yeah well that's that's the problem that's you don't uh how about do you eat do you like French fries i do what would you what would you ever say if they said anybody who eats French fries has to pay a ten percent premium on their life insurance yeah i'd probably get upset uh then you would get upset it's it's uh what they're doing is they're nibbling at the population piece by piece yeah yeah right right and uh and now they know that the number or percentage of smokers is is less than the the uh the people who do not smoke then they can go ahead and do that um right right right if they i i i assume if they they i guess they're saying with the cigarettes though that they've been able to show that it's the number one leading cause of preventable preventable preventable death not yeah but death in this country was a half a million people a year or so dying with smoke relating smoking related yeah but isn't isn't the uh the insurance also for for uh Blue Cross so they're not only saying preventable not preventable death they're also saying um that you'll have uh less likelihood of being sick if you don't smoke right right right right well that's all what i always felt if it if those studies were true about smokers having higher medical costs uh-huh and we do have one smoker in our area who and he he seems to miss a lot of work but um is he an older person um forty well that eight maybe that's not too old yeah forty five forty eight yeah and he and he does miss a lot of work yeah but then there's people you talk to and say i've never been sick a day in my life you know so i guess i guess you know the the studies show as an average yeah not specific cases and uh yeah i thought well with you know if that's really true then then i guess i agreed with the extra premium if it could i mean if they can come along and prove that French fries were the same deal then they have a right to charge for that too i guess well what what do you mean if they can prove it there there's already yeah that that it's a major cause of uh early hardening of the arteries it's it's uh sure it is high cholesterol right well it depends if they're cooked in see see one of the things that will determine whether they're able to do that or not is not their ability to prove that it is unhealthy because we all know that French fries are not healthy for you it's the capability it's the capability of detecting it yeah right right how do you prove someone has eaten French fries right it it's the it's the honor system isn't it it's the honor system i know it'll be an interesting experiment to see how um but i think in time come you're going to see that happening you're going to see um where the high risk people pay a premium but they have to find a way to prove it yeah right right well well i think the same way with alcohol too personally it you know that that would probably be the next yeah yeah the next thing uh i mean but you know there's there's the difference because uh they say you know i guess they say tobacco is addictive i guess they say alcohol is addictive as well but yeah there are more drinkers than smokers if you think about it oh yeah that's there is oh there is and and drinking is still socially acceptable where smoking is socially unacceptable today and so that there's a big difference so that so that they really can't make a a change in in policy about drinking until right right right well it's part of the business world too when you make deals you know a lot times it's uh yeah yeah right right yeah three martini lunch or whatever they say so i guess you can you can classify alcohol as a drug so is a cigarette in my opinion um where it's not something i don't think people that are that are smoking are doing it voluntarily i think they're doing it involuntarily right i know i am um i don't know anybody in their right mind that says that that i'm doing it because i want to i yeah yeah makes me feel better well i i i do i do make that statement i say i do it because i like it but i can't say i'm i'm i'm doing it because i want to i'm doing it because i have to or because my desire is greater than uh right nicotine addiction yeah yeah i have uh my in-laws are both smokers and uh they've tried to quit numerous times and uh-huh and i think the longest they've made it is about three months and then they go to a a friend's house or something and there they're all smoking and and they break yeah they just can't stand it you know all of a sudden they get it's overwhelming and then they break down and then they say i'm a failure and then they just give up you know start up again i uh i started when i was younger and uh it was prior to the time that the the risks were uh were known were known yeah so well i think we've probably talked long enough okay nice talking to you well i can tell you're from you've got that New England accent and you've got that Southern accent does that mean you're you're you're in uh uh New Hampshire what i'm in the Attleboro Attleboro Massachusetts plant Massachusetts yeah yeah i have uh my wife's uh grandparents are from Boston they're oh no kidding  all right so we're supposed to talk about food maybe we'll get a call back saying hey you're not you're not talking about food um no no you can talk about anything you want these these things are just suggestions yeah oh golly well i live in Dallas what what area do you live in uh North Carolina North Carolina oh really it is boring here oh really well boring in the Carolinas they did have uh huh and Jimmy Baker um yes yes we're he's he's not a subject of great pride oh yes it's it's one of our prouder right along with Jessie Helms oh yeah i think i think they were pardon the phrase all in bed together or something twins separated at birth kind of thing yeah somebody somebody let the brains run out on the floor though somebody dropped that baby when it was born oh yeah oh man Jim Bakker oh what a what a dangerous individual i i i know uh how how did Jessie Helms get reelected that's that's what i want to know that's a well that's a good question um what does he do does he just do the people the are there just stupid people where you live or something okay yeah basically yeah yeah that's well that's that's most of it and he plays very heavily on the race issue oh yeah and it's still that's still a big thing here in this backwards state yeah that's too bad because i mean i've been in the Carolinas and you know there are some places in the Carolinas it's really nice there uh-huh yeah my favorite place is Ashville it's right over there in the mountains it's a beautiful place in like yeah yeah it's just that you know i mean if you took all the people out of the state it would be a great place yeah these folks are so backwards it's just ridiculous it's pathetic i i know i think literacy probably the biggest problem there yeah and i i mean the papers are just full of all of this stuff about the educational system they've been changing their standards and this that and the other and claiming this is going to make everything better yeah uh Durham the county right next to us big city yeah had an enormous jump in the uh in the SAT rate oh really and everybody was huh how'd they do that oh let me guess what they did they had classes on the SAT oh no it was even worse than that they falsified the data oh really oh Plano Plano started having yeah just just students Plano actually they went out and they had the where where i live they had the they had the classes on the SAT i've never heard anything so preposterous in my life they're preparing people for the test by having a class specifically for the test how ridiculous i mean of course it has the highest right SAT rate well it also has the highest teen suicide rate too so i mean that and this is national i don't know where it's all going to where it's all going to go oh well i don't know i don't i don't know what's i mean public education is just going down the tubes i mean they're throwing more and more money at it and it just seems to be getting worse and worse yeah and you know what's bad i mean like i'm going into you know an education related field and i just you know it just you know it really kills me you know i mean it's it it really is a shame that you know you know United States somehow we spend more money on each student and the teachers are paid so little i mean i mean how do how do they figure that out oh yeah i don't know that's that's the one thing that i've i've never been able to figure out why you can pay garbage men more than you can pay teachers yeah um well the prestige of being a teacher is also pretty nil well i think a lot of that has to do with the fact that they say well since this is a woman dominated field we can treat them like dirt you know oh yeah yeah i guess that that that must be the rationale for for where it comes from United States it it must be i bet you know i i i'm not knocking the garbage men i mean they're necessary but there's a lot of unemployed people out there who would gladly take jobs as garbage men rate for less money yeah hey that's a hey that's a hard job to get really it is in in in Texas in Texas it's hard because it's almost like a father to son thing yeah well it's it's it's hard in New York too and i mean they get paid twenty eight thousand a year to start gee that's that's ridiculous and teachers only get paid twenty four man i'd carry garbage for twenty eight thousand a year you bet you you bet you man i worked as a welder and i was you don't even get paid that much man i'd i'd go out and dump garbage all the time for that kind of money yeah good exercise you get outside shoot yep you have dogs are your friends knock over a can now and then and leave it open for the dogs you know well ah that's what my that's what my garbage man does i went out the other morning and my my garbage can was sitting in the middle of my driveway jeez i get tired of this i've got a there's a nice little wooden platform out there for the garbage cans and then they throw them anywhere they want to yeah yeah and sometimes they don't even take everything that that's the biggest kick oh so you live in the Carolinas huh the Carolinas uh do much skiing no i'm not i'm not a fool oh okay uh i i'm i'm not really impressed with i mean i lived in Germany for three years i i was i'm not impressed with skiing now i like i like other you know winter sports but i'm not real thrilled about them i i it's okay to watch people go out and break their legs but i'm not going to climb on a couple of pieces of wood and go racing down a slick mountain side i mean that's i've got better things to do with my life uh when i uh when i was uh stationed in England i used the opportunity to travel around Europe a lot and one of my favorite places to go was Switzerland uh-huh uh-huh and it was just great to sit out there in uh Zurich or Bern just sit in the sidewalk cafes oh yeah the cafe um my my wife her favorite actually she was stationed at in in Germany with me too and and uh she she fell in love with Salzburg Austria yeah Salzburg nice Austria nice Europe is nice well well it's well it's such a it's it's it makes the Germans look like slobs i mean Austria and Switzerland do both but yeah yeah really i mean Switzerland is so clean oh not even a scrap of paper on the ground you know well they have these there these real like real strict laws you know they have to hose down the streets like every every other day or something yeah yeah that it's pretty ridiculous i loved it there though yeah i loved it yeah i did i did like the food in Germany it was pretty good um well i i like Europe except for Belgium yeah i i'm i really don't know what the Belgians i mean they have do they really have an identity or i mean i think they have they have an identity crisis a lot of these countries they they really don't know you know what supposed to do no yeah i think i do because half of them are yeah half of them are Middle Eastern and the other half are French Expatriates yeah um-hum and since i hate the French anyway the Belgians try to act like the French yeah and i it was just miserable i hated that place i hate it almost as much as i do France oh my wife and i we had it when we drove through France we paid in tolls to go to Spain and we drove from Germany like the southern southwestern most part of Germany we drove on the tolls and we spent forty six dollars in tolls one way oh and it was like uh it was yeah it was about an eighteen nineteen hour drive sure oh God what a headache what a pain in the butt and yeah and the fuel was so expensive i mean i i just i can't believe i mean when we when we came back on our way back i mean well my wife and i we first we were in Barcelona and we bought like we found this really great cafe that it was like a delicatessen um-hum and we like we bought we filled a full a cooler full of food of all this delicatessen food and then we ate it all the way going up to the France because the food was so so bad and then when we came into Germany i had five centime left i mean that's like that's that's five one hundredths of a franc which is worth yeah it it was probably worth about a twentieth of a penny and and i mean i i i just about kissed the guard i mean when i got there he was like i was like we're so happy to see you he's like you're sort of knew why yeah couldn't even use it yeah really i used to take the ferry over from Dover over to Calais and and drive across France uh horrible i only did that one time yeah yeah i i've done that before uh-huh what well actually actually i've gone where were you stationed at in England uh Mildenhall oh really i was um i was TDY at Bent Waters oh good old Bent Waters for a little while yeah my brother my brother was stationed at Bent Waters for a long time yeah that's a nice place yeah Bent Waters is a is a very nice little place nice little base out in the country yeah nobody messes with them a lot Mildenhall was pretty uh well it was big and it got a lot of attention yeah but uh yeah Bent Waters Upper Hafford all those neat little places that's where i really wanted to be hum yeah my my brother got stationed eventually at Oxbridge he he really enjoyed it there and well well his his wife was British so they had oh Oxbridge yeah they had quite a good time yeah Oxbridge is nice ah everywhere in England is nice i mean a lot of the people i mean it's funny they're just i don't know the standard of living is not as high as you would expect you would think but on the other hand it's it's in a way it's better yeah that what t hat's what i like about it for one thing everything was cheap yeah um i mean i can still remember going going to the store and getting a pint of milk a pound of butter and a loaf of bread and getting change back from my pound yeah you know you can't even buy a loaf of bread in this country  all right well like i told you before and you're talking about credit cards um-hum we put ours up i mean i had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up um i wish i had well you should try it well i it was done for me after a while i had a uh i had a business going and this was back in the eighties i don't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that but uh i had a coin shop and everything was going great while gold and silver was up and it started falling yeah so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards and things got worse and worse and finally boom you lost your business oh God what a nightmare yep yeah yeah it was i ended up going into bankruptcy you know it was one of those things uh oh it'll get better next week you know things will pick up and so there i was in old bankruptcy court well you weren't charging gold and silver were you you can't do that can you oh yeah yeah oh you can oh yeah yeah i was buying from other dealers and uh you know they take payment any way they can get it oh that's a nightmare yeah course on on stuff that i was on merchandise that i was buying on cards it was i was getting the money back because i was selling it i wasn't buying you know just to hold onto it um but it was things like you know rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up um so well i remember before i got married you know when you graduate from college they'll send you all those credit card applications you know of course you fill them all out because you're honored right and uh um-hum um-hum sure i had stuff for like Sanger Harris and you know it got up like to couple of hundred dollars and i thought well that's okay cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month right i wasn't thinking a thing about it um-hum yes that's the way they suck you in yeah i was just stupid and every time they had a sale there i was because you know got get such good bargains um-hum um-hum and i don't know well just today in the mail i got uh i got got my guaranteed acceptance by uh American Express oh yeah we've been getting those yeah i went back to school and got my Master's and they started sending those things to me again yeah as soon as your a graduate student they get your name yeah they did and uh course i guess i guess i've been purged from their records i used to have an American Express uh back when i had my business i got one uh-huh and they they goofed up bad on my first on my very first bill because i was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses yeah and the bill would come in and i'd pay it and the very first bill i paid it and then i got this nasty letter from them saying you're overdue pay so i i said well it just crossed in the mail so i didn't do anything about it Two weeks later i get another letter even nastier and said we're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you don't pay and i looked at that and i said uh-huh so by this time my checks had come back from the bank so i made a copy of the check that they had cashed hum attached it to their letter and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces saying thanks but no thanks and now they weren't check in yeah they were i tell you they don't talk about they're charging that enormous fee every year now what is it now it's up to fifty five on the gold card it's eighty five for the Optima oh i'm sorry fifty fifty what do you mean fifty five you mean fifty five dollars yeah for the green card and it but then what's the interest well now that's the card see and interest is like eighteen or something oh yeah yeah it's um well of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in so there isn't any but on the Optima card it's um let's see right now it's running at about it's not too bad it's actually it's about sixteen and a half percent which is pretty good as far as credit cards go yeah well credit cards well they're dangerous you know my parents don't hardly use them hum-um mine don't either mine don't either they have um my mom has a uh has a MasterCard and a Visa card and that's it i've got all my gas cards because i don't want to carry money around i'll do that yeah yeah now i i do use gas cards now Impact is kind of bad too though yeah yeah yeah you know especially if you get forget to record those little suckers oh yeah exactly uh plastic is just too easy i mean that's the that's the whole problem with it um have uh-huh well and you're tempted if you've got cash a little bit of cash and you don't have enough for the purchase right yeah of course you got to charge it and keep your cash sure naturally that's i got in all kinds of trouble doing that what what are you saying oh uh my husband says i might buy it but i i don't really usually consider that an option well maybe that's how we got in trouble having having having been out of the credit game for some years now i've i've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it and uh yeah but it's hard isn't it well it is but i i i'm kind of uh grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint uh well it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic yeah exactly i i um i just went out and got a new VCR yesterday with cash with cash and it it's do you work with TI no no i wish i did no yeah you could have got a discount couldn't you yeah i could use a discount i have to wait for the things to go on sale but there's always a sell yeah especially on electronic goods yeah especially now what is that thing i saw Circuit Circuit world or something oh Circuit City Circuit City have you been in that yeah they they're not their prices aren't that terrific they they used to be but they've gotten they've got to pay for all that national advertising now oh it's national um-hum i think i've seen two around Dallas yeah they're they're all over the country now they uh they they used to be good i remember when they first opened up they did have good bargains well what else i don't know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it Service Merchandise yeah in Garland you you got Service Merchandise yeah it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go uh-huh and uh Circuit City came along and that was the place to go to get your TVs and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that and then after the years went by they just sort of kept creeping up on price and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now so so so much for Circuit City sure okay what else can we talk about who do you work for i don't i'm a graduate student i'm a professional student we were talking about that just today it is it's it's great we could be just lifelong students it is great i love it where are you going to school NC State what's that uh North Carolina State so you're on Spring Break not yet ours don't ours doesn't start until uh next week so where are you where am i yeah what do you mean where oh in Raleigh oh okay yeah good ole the burgeoning metropolis of Raleigh yeah what what a dead place yeah is it i've got a nice little business at home and i sit around and tinker with that most of the time so what are you getting your degree in um uh human factors and what do you do with it not a thing well what is it uh its it's it's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them huh so it's sociology it's well it's more psychology and engineering uh my my master's is in industrial engineering so you're working on your doctorate yeah oh lord yeah PhD in human factors oh that'll that'll sound wonderful won't it well get you a little name plaque oh yeah IBM uh i mean uh a lot of people use human factors folks but IBM is what i'm looking at right now aren't aren't they laying off several thousand people they might be but not at not at the human factors level well i heard it on the news today i could swear it was IBM there there um no as a matter of fact the IBM right here or in Carey which is a little suburb of Raleigh just just hired one more human factors person doggone it if they'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been me hum how much longer do you have um i'm i'm i'm going into thesis or going into the uh dissertation this summer and get that done this summer uh i'm going to start this summer i probably won't finish it until the end of the year but uh i'm i'm trying to get a uh ooh a uh intern position with IBM right now so that i can find an area to do my dissertation in it's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field because you but why there been so much work done already yeah that's that and and it's it's limited application in some respects um consider in the area that we're in here there's a lot of places that use human factors people most  so what do you think uh the causes of crime um i think it was an imbalance of of power in the United States that's causing the lower class class to rebel that's why there's such such high crime in uh there's crime in uh young people because they don't have real role models yep see too much crime on TV and they think it's way to go i don't know what do you think what about i agree with the upper and lower level you know um-hum because that's the lowest thing for themselves plus there's nobody for them to look up to yeah but i also blame some of it on parents okay because parents aren't parents yeah because i remember even when i was growing up i'm thirty five i remember when i was growing up and i had friends okay that used to do stuff like you know go to the store and steal stuff my mother warned us it's like i don't care what your friends do if you do it then that was it i mean i knew that i would get mean more trouble from my mother than from yeah from anybody else from anybody else and i think that's the basic is they have no morals anymore so they don't care yeah yeah so yeah i think i can agree with that too but now as far as what they can do about it i don't know you can't make parents be parents that's true you got to kind of make want people wanna do the right thing you know i don't know how you do that i guess if you gave the gave them jobs that that's another problem with the United States there's no jobs anymore yeah well i i've heard this one theory that if you know if a kid commits a crime that they've instead of the prosecuting the kid they prosecute the parent or both of them but now put put the blame on the parent that'll work to a point well that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway i don't care what you do to them yeah you know so i think it depends on how much trouble that kids has been in you know yeah because uh a child can get into anything regardless i don't care who how good you they are yeah yeah eventually at least one time but now if it's a repeated thing here with this child in juvenile and all this to me yeah both of them because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do yeah because i just watched it on TV one night on one of them um Twenty Twenty Forty Eight Hours one of them shows where this boy had been stealing cars um-hum yeah i don't know if you seen they was the gang a little it was a little gang of them stealing cars you know and then when they caught him you know his mother sitting there now they're gonna take me away from you that means she was warned hm no i didn't see it yeah but see by that i think that sometimes it a little late yeah you know but i'm sure there's something can be done yeah what about with adults you think they can do anything about just adult regular adult crime yeah start prosecuting they but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system yeah huh for well the major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded well they should start with the the if they would get rid of seems to me i know there's a lot about courts that people don't understand there's more people in jail right now for child support um-hum okay then there are for people doing drugs hm they ought to take all them little misdemeanor people let them go let them go yeah yeah you know give them a fine whatever make them do civic duty whatever put them fools in there that's what they need to put i call i call them all fools idiots whatever little rock stars put all them in there yeah i mean seriously they ought to put those good people to work yeah hm you know the murderers the the drug dealers the user put them all in jail you know and let all the normal people go yeah you know because okay yeah if you write a bad check you go to jail right yeah okay let them people go yeah not let them go and get out of it let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else well they yeah they you still have to punish yeah you know like cleaning up the city or however they do they community time you know whatever that is but yeah that's you know put don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals yeah and they're they're still they can provide for society whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society um-hum yeah so i don't know them people boy they got the i think the United States has got too many problems to be worried about everybody else yeah that's true now how they gonna fix it i don't know the i don't think there is a ready solution no i don't think so either um because the economy is down people you know the the the low man on the pole is getting more of the i guess the bulk of it yeah uh he's gonna have to work extra hard just to make ends meet and they keep taking more money from us yeah people and get and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just gonna take fifty percent of it um-hum yeah they might as well steal it then they don't have to pay taxes on it that's it yeah so you know they i i know that's bad but you know the just like Texas now um-hum they could of had a lottery they don't want a lottery why not i would rather pay for a lottery a dollar two three dollars whatever i'm paying you know a week or whatever they'd have a yeah and never see any of that money than to have them take a portion of my paycheck yeah because you know they take and Uncle Sam takes his the Social Security which probably won't be here when i get that old you know hm because we're payin g for Social Security they using now who's gonna pay for mine yeah yeah but it's it's nah you don't count on Social Security but it's it's that's what i'm saying they need to do something else no i don't know definitely i'm not counting on it yeah hm but crime is gonna go up as long as the economy stays down yeah and it's gonna get worse that's just like last night they killed them people in that store where you at yeah uh i'm in Raleigh North Carolina oh no wonder you don't know then why where are you from they killed i'm in Dallas okay but last night they killed uh uh four people in a chain food oh man and killed them well it was two stores side by side um-hum one was a store and one was like a a fast food place i think it chicken or something i don't know anyway they raped the women yeah beat them all up including the women i mean they just beat them stuffed them in the freezer and then shot them all ow now why was you know dumb why did they do it in the freezer you know why didn't they just if they was gonna lock just lock them in the freezer take the money you know they didn't have to kill them or rape them or anything yeah hm hm that's awful yeah we still get some in Raleigh i mean not not too often real bad ones but um-hum it's just getting really ridiculous down here i wish i could move somewhere where this you know you got to like in the country but i don't think there's anywhere where there isn't gonna be crime so well i think if it's the town is smaller um-hum and everybody knows everybody it's harder to come in there and do something yeah yeah where is and and and see that's another thing neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods anymore yeah there's nobody next door to you you don't know your neighbors and stuff like that yeah it's just huh-uh you know because i moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers hm and you didn't even and the what the manager the manager won't even do anything he's probably drug dealer himself never know um-hum you don't and so i moved because i moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up wow you know and this is like across the street this was a nice part of town hm and then across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that making that um crack stuff and then the other time i saw the cops break down somebody's apartment around the corner i said see this is it hm time to go that's it and i moved and you know now i live in like a family a neighborhood in a townhouse but it's nice i don't you know yeah yeah i'm kind of in the same same kind of deal townhouse in the neighborhood but it's pretty nice i don't know how they can let a neighborhood or apartment complex that's what happened that's what's wrong you know i don't think don't rent to them or rent to them evict them because they drug dealers put it on the lease if you deal drugs you can't live here yeah yeah yeah most of them too scared to do anything about it um-hum that's it yeah all right well listen i got to go it's good talking to you well alrighty and i thank you bye-bye alrighty bye-bye  okay so what kind of car are you thinking about getting well none at the moment No no no well when you decide to i currently drive a a Ford Taurus and uh-huh i would imagine i would imagine that if i change or if i get another car a new car i will go with the Taurus or something similar uh in that regard so you like the Ford absolutely i have had it for about two years now and it's uh uh-huh it's everything it's supposed to be uh i haven't had a minutes trouble with it and uh uh-huh the only thing i have against it in that's it's a Taurus but is it i still feel a little even after two years i still feel uncomfortable driving it because i had a Honda before that uh-huh and so it's a little bit larger but that's the only the only difference that i see really right but i would my my criteria would be at the moment it would be uh American uh personally uh-huh Yeah it's the this the car i had before this one was a Thunderbird as a matter of fact and uh i loved it i really did and um-hum But uh um i finally decided to go check out what the uh what the uh foreign cars were So i bought myself a a a Nissan a two forty S X uh-huh But even though i love the car i've got now i think my next car will probably be American again because if i can at all do it i'd like to stay American i always have up until now i just for one time decided to go outside So uh-huh well my wife drives a still has a a Honda Accord and it's a very it's an excellent automobile uh-huh uh-huh and uh but you know price and so forth i'm not a real car fan so i i i do not uh opt for uh something that would be you know expensive you know i want i want something that's serviceable serviceable something that i can use and uh and i and with the Taurus i have a Taurus uh you know LX and it's you know right uh-huh you're talking when you think about price it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines uh-huh and as i said as far i'm concerned it it has been extremely uh uh serviceable and everything i wanted well Ford's done a real good job in the last uh say ten years or at least the last five to ten six years so of really turning around their um quality i think um uh-huh oh i think so too now i you know in travel and renting automobiles uh in i've driven you know Chevrolet automobiles and so forth and Dodge and i uh-huh if it's Chevrolet i just will not touch it uh um i had a Chevrolet before i bought my Taurus i purchased a uh-huh a Chevy um Citation oh yeah those were not good cars and uh i was ready to get rid of it two months after i bought it and uh uh-huh so i i shopped around and i would i probably if i had thought i uh wanted to pay the amount of money i probably would have gone with uh uh an Accord or even a a Civic or something comparable from Nissan or or Toyota uh-huh right and uh but it was just i had i have a friend who uh has a uh an auto shop and he purchased one of the first Sables that was uh manufactured for his wife a Sable station wagon and he just absolutely swore by it uh-huh and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for you know comparable comparably equipped you know with cruise control and air conditioning and AM FM radio and all these other things uh uh-huh it was just there was no there was no comparison uh the only thing that i find you know if i would have anything against it is that it still has that soft American ride uh uh not well that about the only thing i find you know disadvantageous to it right but my criteria is simply something that looks good something that's serviceable and i you know i drive around a lot but uh and it's you know it's very comfortable on the highway i can drive for you know ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way uh-huh but those are my criteria and i i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again and if there's something out there that uh is comparable to what i have now so i'll go ahead and get it uh-huh You know the only thing i'm looking at right now um i just i just bought you know the Nissan that i've got about uh say nine months ago i guess it was So the only thing that that would um get me to change cars right now would be if see at the moment i'm single and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it But uh i don't have any plans for probably another two three years of even looking you know um-hum uh-huh uh cars are too expensive right now to uh i see yeah to even think about buying new cars every couple of years you know it's in our parking lots uh two or three days ago i saw one of the new Honda sports cars uh-huh uh-huh uh i i can't remember what the name is it's the thirty five or forty thousand dollar one whatever it is and it looked it resembled a Mazaratti very very closely um and it's an absolutely beautiful automobile and well appointed and so forth but uh-huh to pay that much money for an automobile uh is just i can't i can't conceive of doing that yeah that's uh i went to a a car show down here about uh about two weeks ago and um you know of course they had the normal the Ford the the Chevrolet that stuff But then you started looking at the uh uh they had Ferrari there they had uh BMW and and all these other kind of cars and and Ferrari didn't even let you near the car i mean they were that's how expensive they were um-hum um and then you saw uh hundred thousand dollar cars you saw eighty thousand dollar cars and you know even even though i i i do enjoy cars i enjoy um driving them i enjoy uh riding in them and everything but uh i can't see buying or paying more for a car than i would for a house you know i that's true well that doesn't seem likely uh the difference there is too is uh is between us is that i am not really crazy about driving i never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when i was young when i was sixteen uh-huh uh-huh so i've never really cared now what i was you know before i was married and before i went to graduate school i used to do little you know sports car racing i never it was never my own car it was always someone else's uh-huh and that sort of thing i enjoy but to go out and drive uh never has really been had any appeal to me in that regard so uh-huh well i guess we've discussed that enough don't you think we won't we don't we won't get the recorder or the uh system to shut us off uh tonight that's happened to me almost every time i've i think so that's happened to me once so uh well when it's it's very easy when you get a topic you get on a topic that you know you enjoy and yeah like uh you know i think the one time i did it was on Saudi the Mid the Mid East the crisis out there and everything that was had a great conversation but uh then they came off and told us we couldn't do it any more so oh yeah yeah well i was talking to a lady last evening and we were talking about fishing and uh we were cut off uh-huh well we were told to quit okay well you have a pleasant evening uh-huh yeah you too uh-huh bye-bye take care good-bye  sure okay Brian i going to press number one and we'll go okay hey um uh Ronnie i think my first introduction to the metric system was in physics in college and i think prior to that i didn't even realize that another system existed uh but it makes so darn much sense to me over the English system i i i have a hard time understanding why people don't take to it is it well um yeah i'd i agree with the the ease in the use of it and uh the it certainly it's so much easier to do your do computations calculations to measure things with it to in every every aspect of it is simpler except there is one big stumbling block in it and in the United States and that is all of the tool and die equipment in this country that has been here for the last hundred years is in the English system yeah i understand and tool and die equipment doesn't wear out too often no no so i think that's the the one place where uh they will have a hard time uh getting people to change yeah and i noticed that too in uh in uh uh metal stamp metal parts that we buy we at one time went back through and dual dual dimensioned them all uh-huh and uh you know it's uh it's easy to put down point O O one inches or one mil uh it's kind of difficult to have its metric equivalent right uh in in terms of the numbers that you've got to carry around i guess one of the things i i think metrically i've got a uh a and it drives my wife crazy you know she'll say how far is it from here to somewhere she wants to go and i'll say oh about eight kilometers uh-huh and she'll look at me and give me this crazy look but my uh my my uh hobby is distance running uh-huh and basically all of the races are five K ten K fifteen K nobody runs in terms of miles anymore sure uh and i guess that's got me thinking metrically also uh uh we have lived overseas From nineteen eighty one to eighty four we lived Quadalampor Malaysia uh-huh and for in eighty five six and seven we lived in Baggio City in the Philippines uh-huh and i guess you just get used to seeing distances beside the road marked metrically exactly and ultimately at some point you know it doesn't happen overnight but at some point your frame of reference is metric at least in terms of distances right right i uh lived in Brazil for four years from when i was seven to eleven years old and so by the time i got into high school and took some physics there and then into college um where i was a physics major in college so i'm more than uh familiar with the metric system okay and uh but i think that initial period you know from way made it familiar for me so i wasn't afraid of the metric system and and and i knew how much it made sense and how much easier it was to do things that way so i i it's too bad that more Americans can't don't have the opportunity to to really use it to to get to a point where it it's something other than something that causes them fear and confusion because if you just the initial in the initial stages of anything no matter even if it is something that ultimately will be simpler are going to be confusing oh yes yes and it's getting over that hurdle that will yeah finally get us into it if we ever get into it yeah i i i don't think it's going to happen in in in our lifetime at least not in mine uh i think uh there's a gigantic psychological barrier which may be a worse barrier than the old tool and die uh dimension in English right uh and i think that the uh the ultimate solution will be to start introducing it uh in at at the introduction to school right and uh hang on a sec Brian i got to get rid of that caller okay are you there yep okay i think the uh uh the solution is to start it at the earliest uh stages of schooling and uh uh make that the system to which kindergartners and first graders are introduced right uh the drawback to that is i don't think we have any teachers in our other than physics teachers in our school system that are comfortable with it right right that may be true also i don't know chemists seem to and chemists that's what i got my first degree in chemistry too and i and you know we don't talk in quarts and pints we talk in liters and milliliters it okay no i mean can you imagine how ridiculous it would be to try to do calculations i mean it boggles the mind to try to think to do all the chemistry or physics in the English system at this point although gosh all those oh yeah i i i don't think we could even think English and i'm just thinking now in our business you know we make we make chips and uh we assemble them though uh-huh and it's interesting we are uh uh basically talking well we talk about a package size yeah we talk about it in terms of uh uh six hundred mils or six tenths of an inch i guess we do that but on the other hand we talk about the force that it takes uh to move a die out of a package in other words how much uh uh how how well do we have the die uh inhering to the to the base uh-huh and we talk about that in terms of kilograms so we use it a lot we talk about uh gold ball bonds bond strength we talk about that in terms of grams or in terms of kilograms to push the uh push the ball off its substrate so we we tend to have a mixed bag in new concepts uh that have come along with the electronic age i think just sort of get introduced metrically so that's the way we do it right it's interesting in the in though the work i'm doing i'm uh uh uh the kind of things i do is manage uh research and development contracts and we do everything from basic research all the way through uh we have a couple of systems that are actually um places where they're producing a product and what i've noticed is that the places where they're kind of doing fuzzy thinking and uh doing the initial uh development of an idea use the metric system and they talk in terms of metric uh uh units in turn around the people however that have the engineers that are actually producing a product do most of their carry conduct most of their discussion in terms of the English units which i i find uh-huh it's interesting that it's like the guys that are still doing the work that are actually making the stuff are using the English system but the ones that come up with the they're doing these theoretical analysis and the number crunching um are doing it in terms of the metric system i i it kind of seems strange but right you you mentioned just a side light here you mentioned you lived in Brazil whereabouts and Sao Paulo oh Sao Paulo our our plant there is in Cantinas uh-huh and i'm there several times a year no kidding uh and uh of course we fly into Sao Paulo and and drive on to uh uh Cantinas and do you fly into Camgonias or the other one down there down so uth uh i use the other one yeah okay the international airport i can't think the name of it yeah the international airport because i i generally fly in from uh well the last two times i've come in from Mexico City via Menaus yeah uh-huh and uh before that though it's uh it's uh Miami uh Rio De Janeiro Sao Paulo uh type flight sure sure and uh i just love it there i i absolutely uh uh uh love the i look forward to the times i go down there where did you get your from where did you get your physics degree uh the Air Force Academy uh i'm one of those oh okay okay yeah you like Colorado are are you a civilian employee about now or or military yeah no no i'm i'm still in the i'm still a second lieutenant i just graduated in eighty nine oh okay oh okay okay you're you're you you're a bit younger than i thought uh back to the the metric system uh-huh i've got a uh an automobile an eighty six Buick Skylark that's got an odometer that's a digital odometer in both units in other words i can push a button and it's in metric and i can push a button and it's in English uh-huh uh-huh and i i keep it in the metric uh all the all the time and we were taking another couple to a ball game last summer uh-huh and it was uh floating up there around a a a hundred a hundred which is about is about sixty two miles an hour and it was floating up there about a hundred and the wife of the couple looked at me she said my God slow down i didn't realize you were going this fast right and so we we you know we have a hard time getting people getting uh uh getting them to think metrically but right it's going to be a big psychological barrier and i don't think that we can educate kids all the way to their adulthood and then introduce it to them right because if we if we keep doing that it's it's not going to work oh yeah but but but interestingly enough we think it makes sense to to think metrically with our money oh yeah you know ten cents makes a dime ten dimes makes a dollar uh which is basically thinking metrically right well the whole but why twelve inches make a feet a foot and three feet make a yard i you know yeah i don't or the whole number system is digital so how can you have uh or it's it's base ten rather and so how can you have yeah how can you have these uh strange i i  hi right oh me i'm in favor of it you are yeah i thought i think if uh people like Charles Manson right the the heinous crimes uh even if it's one time offense yeah the the i mean people like that are crazy i did a study on it though when i was in high school it was one of these things we had to pick a topic to to investigate and at that time i don't think it's like that any more but at that time uh it was very unfair capital punishment was a lot more common and if you tended and it tended to be that if you were ignorant or if you were a foreigner or if you were black or any minority for that matter the chances your chances of of uh getting the death penalty were you know like hundreds of times greater than if you could just communicate well i mean you didn't have to be um you didn't even necessarily have to be white but if you could just communicate and you could come across in the court room with some kind of um you know sense about you then even if you did the exact same crime chances are you wouldn't get you'd get life instead of the death penalty as a opposed to somebody who couldn't communicate well and at that time it just seemed so fair unfair that um i i felt like i couldn't uh um you know i just didn't agree with it yeah it's gotten so though that there are so many you know there are so many uh i don't know what you call it uh so many different things that you have to go through before they actually give the death penalty that i'm not so sure it it seems a lot fairer than it used to be yeah well i know that that um like they can hold it off for years by uh i'm trying to think of the word that you were um retrials and um right right i'm forget i cannot think of that word right i know what you're saying um but yeah they there's you know there's always uh uh you know and and in a way you know i guess that's good i mean if you're going to if you're going to kill somebody you have to make sure they're guilty right yeah you know give them give them i mean you should give somebody every every chance even even if it seems obvious yeah um i don't know what the what the law is like in Texas i mean i certainly haven't heard anything any anything about somebody being executed or anything uh-huh yeah well i think it's all uh i don't think they have uh execution here i don't i don't either i do know though it's easy to get put in jail for life yeah well you know the um there was something on TV last night about how one state what there was a newspaper in no it was a TV station TV station you did you see that yeah he's they're wanting to record a gas chamber i thought that was disgusting i mean well it might scare some people off of doing the crimes well yeah but you know there there are so many people who just get get their jollies off of watching that you know yeah i yeah i agree with you there too and that's what that's what really bothers me you know i'm all for deterrents but i i think what's going to happen is it's going to turn it into a circus yeah well i'll agree with you there i don't agree with them showing it on television hard telling who would see it and no but i i do think that it would scare some people from doing things you know they'll think about this and say hey i don't think so right sure well where i could see it being very useful is for you know when if there's a first time offender part of his punishment is that he's got to see what you know what he's up against yeah you know what what you know what might happen but the you know for TV station you know that TV station isn't going to want to restrict how they use it and they're going to show it on the six o'clock well probably not the six o'clock news but they'll show it on the eleven o'clock eleven o'clock news and i don't you know i've got a ten year old and you know she's she could very well be up at that time yeah you know when we're and that's just not the kind of thing for a ten year old i'm not sure it's the kind of thing for a sixteen year old yeah that's i don't think it's the kind of thing for anybody i know i wouldn't be able to watch it right right and i'm i'm supposed to be an adult right and in fact i think it'd be harmful if my if you know if my daughter or my any of my kids saw it so that has to be brought into the picture too you know you just can't blatantly say let's let's show it and and the the right people will see it and it'll deter them from committing a crime all lot of the wrong people are going to see it too and uh yeah well there's more wrong people that would see it than right people yeah yeah uh you know uh but i i i don't know i think i would say that if they put it where those first time offenders of uh your sex crimes and murderers uh show them what would happen right now my aunt had a thing when i was younger and uh you know i was working with her and she would say that they should uh for men who did sex crimes they should take off a piece of his body and the most important part to a man and inch by inch yeah right yeah my wife says that all the time yeah well that that would certainly do it that would stop them from wanting to no well i thought it was funny listening to her she's just a she's she's a little bit uh dingy when it comes to things but well she's vicious yeah well you know i i think that if if i felt like the the the system was was truly fair and and uh and that they would never make a mistake then you know but you hear you know you hear about people who are who are genuinely mistakenly accused of a crime and yeah like that Lionel something or another that black boy of they had a television program about him two hour movie yeah can't think of his name i can't i can't think either but he spent quite a few few quite a while in jail yeah right that's right and and it turns out he didn't do it yeah or you know and and it's easy you know and and you know let's face it not all policemen are honest and well you see that on television also that's right and and you know they can they'll take somebody who maybe is mentally retarded and then it's and they're under pressure to to solve a crime and some and the circumstances uh may be molded to blame somebody who didn't do it and especially if it's you know somebody who's mentally retarded who can't defend themselves very well and i'd hate to see them get the ultimate punishment and it turns out it wasn't them yeah that's a problem with capital punishment though but when you got people that you know uh for some reason or another Charles Manson sticks in my brain right yeah yeah well he was a i seen him on an interview talking about how if he ever got out how many people he was going to kill yeah sheesh and uh that's a man that should be put to death and uh it it it just doesn't seem right that our tax money or somebody's tax money goes to keep him alive yeah you know he gets three meals a day and and he probably that's more than some of the people out here who are out and out honest right right that's right and he's probably living a lot better than some people who deserve a lot more and uh that does you know that does sort of you know but how you know it's just so hard it's just so hard to to be fair and uh yeah i guess i wouldn't i wouldn't mind if all of a sudden he didn't exist any more uh i uh i don't think anyone would miss him either no no uh i you know i i think the same thing about people like Saddam Hussein yeah you know you know the jeez you know they're just they're just the scum of the earth and uh i just hate the idea that my tax money might go to support somebody like that well as you can tell my two decided to come in here uh now where where where area where are you from what i'm in Denison Denison oh okay every so often you get somebody who's in in uh California or or New York something yeah i got some guy from San Francisco one night yeah yeah uh no you is talking about Saddam Hussein yeah i think it would be wrong for us to kill him for the Americans to kill him i think you're right i don't think we're i think we're we'd we'd overstep our bounds if we went in and did that i think the though it's awfully tempting now if one of the Kurds i'm sure you know who they are yep if they went in and got him he wouldn't be a martyr what's the word martyr martyr martyr martyr yeah yeah i could see the word in my head i just couldn't pronounce it yeah uh but if we did it oh man oh yeah the whole they'd have him on a pedestal well right now we're in a delicate situation because we've got this we've for the first time we're sort of aligned with a lot of these Arab countries yeah that's what my husband keeps telling me see how you know um i'm just now getting into the world politics and all that yeah uh i guess i just too young to understand this or something oh sure uh but uh it's complicated yeah well it's getting easier to understand though you know plus my husband he was in the Navy for ten years so he uh when it comes to the military he kind of knows what he's talking about oh right i don't put every a hundred percent stock into what he says but i'll listen and agree with what i think sounds right right right yeah there and you know he's got that delicate balance right there and we'd just be overstepping our bounds i think if we walked in and sort of took over yeah well i think they uh the people there will take care of him now yeah i just can't imagine that they'd let him rule any longer you know if if they had you know if they could do something about it i mean his own army is going to eventually turn on him because and and you see this has happened before in history you know that it just gets to a certain point where you're just not willing  okay i was thinking about camping and different i people's ideas about it um-hum we've even seen people with these campers and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their TV when they're going but that's not right or the satellite dish yeah a satellite dish on top of those recreational vehicles oh golly that's not the kind we do do you go camping yeah we have a little bit and we've just gotten one of those little tents that we throw out on the ground and that's what we camp in so we kind of rough it well so do we in fact when we first got married we would try to take these trips to Minnesota to see his family um-hum and we didn't have a tent or any camping supplies so we'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks i mean i know it's dangerous i wouldn't do it now but we did oh no and one time we went to Yellowstone and we were doing the same thing we couldn't find a place to camp and so we were on top of a picnic table with our our sleeping bags i guess and this ranger comes up with this light shines it on us and said that we're just bear bait out there we had our food you know oh uh-huh and told us to get inside our car gosh bear bait bear bait that would make me nervous yeah have you done any camping around here yeah we've got some land at Holly Lake outside of Tyler uh-huh and go up there fairly often sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it yeah that sounds fun and we've done things like when when it's kind of cold we take extension cords and we've all brought heaters in our tents and in the summer same thing we get our extension cords running from all these tents but we've got the fans going right so we're not roughing it too much and we have taken TVs out there for the kids yeah yeah and they've got their electrical hookups so it's not so bad yeah do you go on long like a week at a time or just weekends i think the longest we've stayed out there is like five days and they even they had a library at one time out there uh-huh oh so that's really not roughing it so much but yeah we have gone on trips we've bathed in streams uh-huh that's kind of different yeah i like the campgrounds that have a nice shower and a pool to go to that would be nice uh-huh yeah we've uh we camped at the DeGray State Park in Arkansas in the fall and there was nobody else hardly around and it was just really nice that time of year we had taken our electric blanket too just in case it was unbearable but we didn't need it well my husband has even camped at Lake Lavon with one of his friends he just decided to take the kids out there oh really yeah i mean it's not very many miles from our house at all but they had the time of their lives you know oh yeah had the boat just pulled up right by the tents uh-huh it wasn't bad that sounds nice yeah and we've taken our tents though loaded them up in car carrier and decided we were going to tent most of the way and it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for the night we'd take a vote and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel yeah instead of getting out all that stuff you know yeah it's a lot of work to set up just for one night yeah then you have to get up the next day and move it on right huh-uh but we're set now we've got cook stoves and we've got our bug light and everybody's got their sleeping bags we got air mattresses we decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable yeah those are nice we have one of those too uh-huh yeah those double ones pretty good we're on our third one i think somehow yeah how do you blow yours up we've got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter oh we we were looking at those in a magazine last time we went we took our vacuum cleaner with us i didn't know you could do that and yeah you can if you can reverse the nozzle on your vacuum cleaner and it blows air out instead of sucking it in and you can yeah fill them up that way but it something that's smaller would be a lot more convenient no joke i hope you didn't have a big vacuum cleaner no uh-huh we have a my husband and i we have a pickup truck so there's plenty of room to hold things yeah now we've used a hair dryer before uh-huh but i put it on hot and also melted it oh no i found that you don't do that yeah i didn't realize it would melt so easily oh i don't know we take we take our dog camping she likes to go out and stay in the woods sleep she sleeps in the tent with us yeah it's fun i don't like it when there's mosquitoes so bad oh me either and then one night we were camping and it came just a torrential downpour we had the steaks on the grill these people were with us and it i mean everything was sopping wet inside the tent it was just that bad you know oh no and we decided we'd just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything uh-huh so i got a condo with a jacuzzi and it was wonderful yeah oh boy that was lucky yeah it was we've been lucky we've never really been rained on the few times we've gone it's horrible oh i bet it when we were younger when i was a kid we camped in Virginia and we had one of those little pop up tents which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground but it seemed like it rained every weekend for about a year the year we we were really into camping you mean that you put on a truck or what uh no it's a little trailer you pull behind your car and uh oh yeah yeah you know you the lid pops off the little tent comes up the top and it had two double beds in it how many weeks have you been doing these calls oh since the beginning i guess it's been two or three weeks i think this must be into my third week too so do you work for TI uh well i work as a temporary in the Speech Lab in a speech lab uh-huh where they're doing this program the voice recognition program and what exactly are they going to do oh they turn them over to somebody and they're going to i guess they're going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff so any voice no matter what the speech pattern or the dialect or anything right yeah hum i wonder if these are going to be speaking the computers i don't know i type up the tapes of what people talked about oh that's kind of neat yeah it's sort of interesting do you put all the uh-hums in here on everything too uh-huh everything like that all the little stutters and everything what do you write for stutter duh duh oh like if they say i i we just type it in like that uh-huh well i guess that's it for camping huh i guess so unless you want to talk about stakes what size stakes to put in you need metal instead of plastic yeah and you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time we got one of those kind that have got the yeah oh what is it they're plastic and they've got the elastic on the inside of the poles and you just put them together and it's a dome tent oh uh-huh that's what we have too yeah that's what ours is that's good isn't it yeah yeah they pop up pretty fast yeah but have you ever camped on sand um no that can be a mess we camped at the beach one time and that was sort of miserable you just couldn't everywhere you went there was sand you couldn't even when you're eating it it was in your bed i've done it in a shelter uh-huh it was in Padre Island and in a truck of course not but not in a tent oh uh-huh oh well that's about all i know to okay uh-huh bye okay well it's good talking to you bye  hello hello this is Jim in Dallas uh how you doing fine i'm Callie in Garland oh you're right here okay yeah i'm i'm actually working tonight i just uh called and came in yes oh are you so do you work at TI yeah you yeah i just got a little booklet uh this not what we're supposed to talk about just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts and i thought oh i better make some calls i know i know aren't they yeah well i haven't get a chance i haven't got a chance to look at them yet i love it in the it was a lot nicer than i expected my daughter uh got a few calls at home she talked to some student in i guess they give them to computer students too and uh Virginia or something like that she's talked to two students i've talked to i don't think they were students one i think worked at a university university um and the furthest away i've talked to someone has been New York yeah oh yeah great uh we're supposed to talk about the elderly now i guess uh so yes we are do you have anybody that you uh have are close to that decision on or anything or i've thought about it for myself and all and my wife my wife's mother is uh in a retirement home she's not in a nursing home uh oh well that's not did you push the button yeah did i did we push did you let me i'll hit it again just in case okay just in case i did it right as she said yeah but uh she's she's down in San Antonio it's it's a uh now what's oh it's a brand new one it's a Catholic uh retirement home for nuns it's at uh Trinity no let me see Trinity i keep calling it Trinity it's not Trinity i'll think of oh Incarnate Word and they have a retirement home for the nuns and they take some lay people well isn't that neat isn't that neat yeah and that one's really super now i i know what they're talking about on regular retirement yeah there's not too many they do have a wing where the people who are really sick you know have nurses uh-huh oh that's good and then they have other wings that we visited uh that are very nice i mean it's just super that's neat just supervised more or less than anything and security i guess for them oh yeah they they they have uh like uh a guard with locks we've been there once at night at Christmas she just went in last year oh she drives and everything she she's perfectly healthy uh right what made you all decide to put her or had what made her decide to go well her husband died they were in the military together and she just did not want to take care of the house right by herself and she visited the place and then fell in love with it and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind so to speak and so ah well that's good she's happy as as heck uh and they serve meals of course that's great and they have clubs and a swimming pool so that's nice now i i know the ones where you're really ill we visited a long time ago when she had a grandmother that was in one um-hum and they were all more or less hospitalized type you know really really sick it's a tough question right shut-ins and yeah it really is i worked at one as a teenager i volunteered at at oh you got experience more experience than i do then on it well it was really it was really sad heartbreaking i guess yeah yeah and uh i just oh i just felt for those people that especially the ones that never got visited oh that would be awful i never thought about that you know that just bothered me that just bothered me so much especially you know at my age i was probably about fourteen um-hum and that really made a bad impression on me so i've always thought not not really bad of them i mean because they are most of them i i believe are probably pretty good for the people but i don't know it's just a that would be a tough tough decision yeah i think that uh hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it and they're getting nicer right i've seen on TV where they take animals and young children in fact my daughter is one my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school took them to an elderly home and boy that really pumps them up that uh helps yeah is very nice to see young people i think that's one of the sad things is when you're in an older home um-hum um-hum if you just have people your own age you never get a chance to see kids or anything or animals or anything you know you can't take care of them right right obvious obvious you can't take care of children or animals in a nursing home but it's nice to have them visit and everything right yeah and get that youth back yeah you know sometimes that even helps them you know just being around young people the because some of them are so um you know just stationary i mean they'll get in a wheelchair or they'll just sit in a chair and and till you come along and really try and pump them up they're just right stationary and i feel like gosh that's all they do all day long so um so i do love to see young kids go and and men take the pets and everything i think that's a real real neat idea yeah i think you do get more by stimulation stimulation my in fact my mother-in-law just visited she's just about seventy five again perfectly fine yeah but one and and she visit us here in in Dallas when she went back every time she goes back to uh San Antonio my wife has two sisters there too she said she's much better she's much more alive and and uh active when she's been on a visit with somebody else you know and that's yeah and our routine has come obviously hectic with teenagers and everything and she's much and so the stimulation part is really important i think like any animal anything you just lay around uh that's the fastest way to die i think you know right right stagnant yeah that's exactly right i think they're really neat um of course i've seen those reports on TV the horrible ones and that scares me oh yeah i'm afraid i'm a TV flipper anything bad i like i like to flip i flip it off but it is sad it's sad yeah it really is it it's sad to think that we would do that to people and you know i've seen them on TV with uh bed sores and oh yeah uh they just stay in the same clothes or the same sheets and not do laundry and i just think how can you do that these these people have given so much of their lives you know to to America you know or whatever and here is here is how we treat them we just put them in a home and leave them yeah right when i was uh younger we i lived in the east i'm from the east really and it seemed like there several people that i knew that had their uh parents i guess they would be but well in their seventy living with them um-hum and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old and i guess she she had her own separate room and i think whether it's more a custom up there or maybe because i was younger and it's just not a custom anymore right to have uh you know the grandparents live with you anymore i guess that uh well we are getting away from that which is not right i think it's right i think it's neat i think uh you learn a lot from them you oh yeah from all their experiences and and that's one of my favorite things to do sit around and listen to their stories oh right right i think that's neat because they really have a lot of good ideas insights that my father my husband's father is really old he he had him late in life and he's he'll be eighty this year yeah oh and i just uh he lives with different you know people in the family he'll switch from time to time i just well that's nice in a lot of ways yeah i just couldn't imagine locking not locking him up but putting him in a home and just but that you were implying you said that by mistake yeah right lock him up that's what i think about it for me i think well my kids better not do that to me i don't want that you know so i i think of it well how would i want to be treated rather than oh i know i know right right right exactly you know it's easy to say well yeah let's let's put these old folks in a home but when i think i don't want to do that you know i don't want to be have my little home i always threaten my daughters i say well um-hum that's right i'm going to build a little house behind yours and then and i'll take care of your lawn he says but i'm not going to one of those places right yeah oh you're not going to put me away that's what my mother she always you're going to lock me up one day aren't you i can tell i can tell you're going to lock me up that's what we that's the way we call it which is really wrong but my wife's mother and the one she's in San Antonio it's you know it's everything but the opposite of what you've seen i mean it's it's a little hotel hotel you might say i know it right that's great again a swimming pool and grounds and she has enough room she has two bedrooms and a and a separate living area gosh they don't have kitchens or anything but they have little it's like uh right on each floor they have a little kitchen area where you can go down and have a make a meal you know yes prepare your well that's great can now can she leave um on a day by herself oh yeah it's it's it's nothing like that it's like living in the hotel i mean she's totally on her own oh man that's neat uh and she still drives which we do does scare us some because she has dented a few things you know yeah and we keep thinking about that you know because she they get less alert and they don't care and i've seen some of these elderly people on TV you know the ones from Florida that just run into people and they don't even understand what happened you know right right i know bless their hearts you hate to hurt them by doing that that's like their one last thing that they can still do and you take away that driving ability and that would really be hard we've i know i i know go ahead i'm sorry uh well we've thought about doing that for for my husband's father because he's oh he still drives yeah that's great well it's wonderful in one one respect but i don't know if you can afford the insurance yeah well luckily he drives a big old tank yeah so he i mean i don't think he he could get hurt i just hope to God he doesn't ever hurt anyone but he he hasn't had any accidents luckily right that's good i mean people are all different yeah yeah i i wonder if they should give them a test or at least maybe uh not take their license maybe give them a refresher driving course and just to just to see how well they are every five years right i saw that on Twenty Twenty that are they doing it they um you know they're testing that they're you know thinking of doing that and i think that'd be a great idea because you i think they do come become less aware and they just i don't know they and they don't hear as well for one thing and that doesn't help yeah well everybody needs retraining it doesn't hurt uh no that's you know the best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches and i don't know why you couldn't after sixty five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving it would it would sure the insurance companies would would probably help pay for some of that you know right right at least that way the burden's not on the family of taking their license or their car away right there you go there's a good point very good point it's on the state very good point but i think they need should do that and then the families will have said  the taxes tend to uh keep going up but uh i don't know if it helps me any to look at some of the other countries and say well there's always someone that's that's worse off in what they end up paying but uh go ahead i think i think we're always convinced that we're paying too much in taxes without getting back necessarily everything we'd like to but so far i don't think i've paid enough taxes to be too too awfully concerned about it yet yeah i'm still still i'm able to survive and and uh working for a company that reaps some benefits from the tax money it's almost like you're paying your own salary i don't work directly for the government but uh getting government contracts and being in the defense industry as it were even realize a little slim these days it's still uh yes still a feeling of you know it's not totally wasted dollars if you think about it some of it coming back your way right uh that helps the rationale any but it's still angering to see the abuses uh even though they're uh a relatively small percentage they still they sound humongous when they're you know you hear millions and sometimes billions of dollars spent and and even some of the arguments over the national endowment for the arts and what's happening in that area it's still a pretty small chunk considering what actually flows through that government so but those are the things that get us going or get us stirred up sometimes people right desire that that money not be spent well do you all pay state income tax no no Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet that's neither do we and and and i agree with the yet part they've just started talking about introducing a state income tax and right now we pay an extremely high state uh sales tax almost eight percent well by the time the city gets involved i'm not sure how many how many people have their hand in it but we pay eight and a quarter cent wow so it's it's pretty pretty much but i think it's divvied up pretty much too uh the county gets some the city gets some and the state gets some right and it's it's quite a bit i think six something is the state and and uh the rest of the pie goes elsewhere but we're in a particular part of the state that's pretty well off so it's it's like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes well that's good yeah we have a real good you know police department and real good uh city services and boy the parks are all over the place and there's a lot of lot of money spent on us but uh the poor rural folks uh barely can get ambulance service and everything else so it's it's a real mixed blessing i guess to that's i think that's the biggest problem i have with the tax system is there there is such a disparity between between really the haves and the have nots and i i think the things that they use as a basis for distributing back the tax dollars needs to be looked at again yeah it'd be nice if you could find someone oh uninfluenced by groups and and honest enough to find a way that would go over and then you'd have to find a way to make it work i know that would be a a definite B V R M I R yeah yeah the uh bureaucracy seems to spend more money just trying to administer some of these programs than the programs are worth uh it seems uh an awful waste of time to have so many people having to fill out so much paper just to get rid of so few dollars in some of these cases i think a lot a lot of times it seems like the classic can't see the forest for the trees i i wonder if if they realize so it make the the magnitude of some of the red tape you have to go through yeah and so much of that red tape was was initially and is added on to try and stop a given abuse you know you discover a particular problem and say well we ought to run this extra check and we'll have to file these extra papers to say well you you deserve this welfare or whatever and they just keep trying to to close all the loopholes and stop the abuse and all they're doing is making it worse and having to add more staff and and uh decreasing the efficiency of those who are actually trying to stop the abuse and i don't i don't think they're getting their money's worth and i i i definitely don't think that the added steps are are getting the benefit that they would like them to i think it's just causing most everyone else more problems because if somebody wants to get around the tax laws they will find a way um-hum if they want to badly enough they'll either find it themselves or they'll find someone to do it for them right it does seem to be the case i don't know whether it's worth and the economy has gone pretty well for a hundred years or so with the government doing what they do with taxes steering investments and steering virtually every dollar you make or spend it gets uh steered one way or the other based on tax breaks you get and you know housing had tax breaks for a while and then they slacked off on that for a while and then just uh generally wanting to be in control of of where everything's going for the most part give you the best break if you go their direction i don't know what what would happen if we uh got rid of some of those controls and just went to what some people would say would be simpler of just having uh you spend this much uh therefore you should be taxed this much that would only encourage saving it's not a you know a tax your income because now you're talking about having to report it and all that kind of stuff right but if you put the burden on the retailer who really doesn't care if you you know buy your groceries and the like he doesn't care who bought the groceries you're going to pay the tax on it so most people tend to spend what they make anyway in in our income income brackets right so you know those fifty thousand dollars or the thirty thousand dollars would pretty much spend the majority of it and what they didn't save they wouldn't or what they could could save they wouldn't get taxed on and that makes sense but like you said i mean it it seems simple and i think in a way it's so simple that people would be afraid to try it yeah but you wouldn't be able to steer people toward a particular type of savings you wouldn't be able to say well you get better tax bonds if you you know avoid the capital gains tax and if you do it this way do this and you roll over your IRA's and all that they yeah you wouldn't be able to steer people toward retirement and all that but boy if you save that much money and it didn't have the taxation problem well you might might do all right i don't know it seems yeah even if you didn't invest in necessarily the the best thing you would have so much more to invest you you'd still be ahead yeah that's for sure and that's something that's something i need to to learn a lot more about is is under the current structure what is the best thing to be investing in for the future because that's a that's a scary thought you always hear that Social Security won't be around by the time we're sixty three or sixty five and and need it and that's a scary thought right that's true plus what what there will be of it even if it's there isn't quite enough anyway so no you're looking at having to do it on your own for the most part and then hope what you did didn't go away yeah the uh the taxes are are kind of messed up i guess with the abuses and the things we've written into it but uh looking looking at some of the other countries and some of the other options you have in the world there it's not all that pleasant anywhere we still look pretty good don't we yeah pretty much well i hear one of my kiddos doing something they shouldn't be so i'll uh let you go and maybe okay it's been nice talking to you maybe maybe we'll catch each other again okay have a good evening i'll try bye thanks bye-bye  so uh what do you think about our involvement in the Middle East well actually i think it's good i i i hope that we uh uh get a chance to uh promote peace out there uh because i think without peace we're not going to get uh stable oil prices and and uh i'd i'd really like to see stability in in that area because i'm always afraid that's where uh another big war is going to start not that Desert Storm was a small one yeah well yeah that's probably true i i suspect that if any world war is come at this point in time they're going to come from there uh i would think anyway i mean it just seems to me that that's that's the most unstable part of the world as far as i can tell i saw um just recently where uh uh the US is supposedly going to be uh putting pressure on all the you know the Israelis supposedly to to come to a bargaining table to uh actually i heard that the Israelis were even talking at least mentioned about giving up some of the Golan Heights really yeah that'd be interesting because i um i actually um um i'm i'm i'm Jewish and i'm actually sort of not not not not not really a Zionist per se you know i'm not okay but i have a um i have a lot of friends you know who are sort of adamant you know Israel should it's his right and they do whatever they want and i think they've been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing and uh you know in some sense may the moderates may be right they may you know may be it is better if they give up just a little bit just to sort of settle things down well uh i guess it's one of those things that uh if it's going to really promote a lasting peace if there is not going to be a peace right then then then it then is it worth it at all yeah i mean i i because the way i mean sort of the way to think about it is well they won you know they sort of took over the um they're one of the only countries in in in history that has been told that they have to give back what they took in a war which they didn't start basically so oh yeah so i don't i don't know how to i don't i don't know what to do about it but um but i think that that you know in general the region is really in bad shape do you think the US is going to wind up keeping uh military bases over there um probably oh isn't isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something i i haven't heard that i i watch CNN every once in a while but i i haven't specifically heard anything about that i just heard something about moving recently about moving um there there there's some central command post in Tampa i think they now want to move to somewhere in the Middle East actually there was um a small country or small city i think well you know not actually in Saudi Arabia or or anything but a little bit off to the um east of it i think and i they want to keep something over there so that they don't have to um i guess it's i guess it's so that so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something i'm not quite sure exactly why they want to do it but they want to keep some sort of central command post there what i thought was interesting is that uh apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet that's true yeah and uh well i guess there's still the possibility that uh hostilities with uh US troops could still break out yeah that they they they claim that's why we're still there i mean you know why only you note it's only only a small number of people have actually come back yet yeah but i think that's actually the scariest part because when in the way what what's happening in Iraq right now you know just in itself it it it being so crazy there i have no idea what i mean what do you know just to imagine that one day they're going to turn around and someone's going to say we don't like you and just start attacking again and it's going to be worse i don't know um do you have relatives over in Israel no i don't i have i i have some friends in Israel and and coincidently actually my wife is Syrian um oh really yeah so i am we are sort of we are the Middle East peace talks at home um and uh pardon me i'm just sort of putting away some things from dinner now in the background but we um we yeah she has sort of friends and family in Saudi Arabia actually well friends in Saudi Arabia and um i have some friends in Israel and we we talk a bit about it but we try and keep it out of out of the home life do you uh does does she ever want to go back to Syria no she was she's actually um i think it's um for her not not really relevant because she was she's second generation American actually oh okay her parents who were born here would like to go see it though i think they would like to go to Syria but but they recognize that Syria's not the place that one wants to visit no right about now no you know just something about the place makes it not not quite enjoyable do you ever want to go over to Israel yeah i i'd actually been there um i was there a couple years ago when it wasn't as you know sort of dangerous to be out there i guess oh okay yeah and i do i do i do like it actually um i would never live there i think i'm too Americanized and um sort of have too much you know too much invested in sort of the the easy life but i do like the food yeah yeah if that if so if that if if that amounts for anything okay well who you know do you have uh a lot of Kosher foods there at your house yeah actually my house is Kosher but um it turns out that one one of the strangest things about about Israel is that no um most folks don't realize that but all the food that people think of as sort of you know Jewish food and so forth um um-hum and you know um in general really isn't the food that is eaten in Israel so you you i'm sure you probably typically think of it like bagels right you know bagels and lox yeah turns out you don't you don't you don't really find bagels in Israel what you find is sort of Middle Eastern foods the same foods that you find in um Syria and Egypt and everything else you find things called have you ever had those yeah no no no uh kishkes or knishes or which is oh oh knishes no you don't you you you don't see a lot of that that's basically Eastern European Jewish food oh it's it's very different i'm i i was actually very amazed when i sort of figured this out for myself that everything i grew up with really wasn't Israeli it was more Jewish you know i got you it it it it is very strange um yeah still get your Passover Matzi and all that right that that starts tomorrow night that's what i'm making that's what i'm d oing now i'm making dinner oh really i dated uh i dated a nice Jewish girl for many years up in Chicago and i was the only Goyim at at all the you know Seder dinners and everything and i used to have to go with rolls of not pocketful of change to buy all this bread the kids would sell me ought to buy the bread from that's great well you've you've you've really got a handle on this stuff i've noticed you not not got got the vocabulary down and everything yeah not uh just just enough to get by that that that's actually real good yeah we um we actually we have the reverse situation turns out that um um most of my friends aren't Jewish and and and my wife's not but i okay but i um i sort of you know do a lot of these things so so that um Seder's you know our our first Seder is tomorrow night and this is a rare exception there are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night which and five of them will be Jewish oh two two years ago we had a Seder we had sixteen people each night sixteen seems the magic number for us wow and i was the only Jew both nights oh really so so which to me is wonderful because it means that people who never would get these to see this um so get to see it and my view is Passover is should sort of be in in in in in in my mind Passover is sort of a generic holiday anyway because it it sort of predates Christ yeah so well they had the matter of fact i just watched uh Charles Heston this uh this weekend in the Ten Commandments oh yeah i caught the end of that did you yeah every year i try and catch that but yeah that's what always amazes me actually is that um is that you know my my wife and i always sort of bring this up about she her her being Syrian you know and my being Jewish and all we look alike we act alike we sound alike well not totally alike but you know um um it's amazing to think that people in the Middle East sort of all hate each other well that's uh to me it's it's really um i i i guess i guess i can intellectually uh kind of come to grips with all of that but you know emotionally i have a real difficult time believing that uh that that people that believe in God and and love not war and to forgive can't get together right you know i mean i i know that the problems are so deep but i mean even even within the Muslim uh religions different sects they can't get together right that that's actually the part that that that i find really strange i mean i i i sort of understand somewhat i mean i i knowing the history i understand that the hatred of the Muslims for you know the Israelis or whatever and i can sort of handle i can sort of handle that and the Palestinians but i sort of think about the Muslims sort of running around having jihads against themselves yeah you know i mean and and that seems really weird or the uh the the you know the Catholics and the Protestants up in Ireland right exactly you know i mean i i same same thing yeah i don't i'll i'll i'll never understand it uh my view is look what'd you ever do to me yeah yeah didn't hurt me you know at at at the moment so um and and i i don't know there's a there's something about there's a poem somewhere i don't know if you've ever seen it or not um um Everything I Ever Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten have you ever seen this and it talks about how you know if we could just all get together you know when we were young everything was great because we you know just sort of all went to class together and in the middle you know we all had snack time together and then we all took naps and we all held hands and hugged yeah you know and that's and that's and that's what that's what kindergarten was like and wouldn't it be nice if if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and and took a nap together woke up and had snack time you know and then hugged each other as as we left it sounds like a it sounds like a John Lennon uh type yeah i wonder if he secretly did that gosh  do you have a favorite type of music you listen to um most frequently i listen to contemporary Christian music but i like all forms okay i uh we i listen to country and rock and classical jazz is probably my least favorite although i enjoy it too uh-huh i tend to favor uh rock and roll mostly from the sixties and seventies oh yeah some great sixties tunes yeah i listen to KGPS classic rock KGPS in Dallas right oh are you in Dallas uh yeah i'm in Plano uh well probably around the corner um yeah that's a good station i listen to it every once in a while too uh-huh do you play any instruments no i don't never have i'm not musically gifted at all well i took piano lessons in fourth grade once for one semester i'll never forget Mrs Burkhalter Miss Burkhalter she had that Nazi mentality where uh uh where'd you grow up uh in Milwaukee oh okay uh-huh the uh yeah the only thing how to play on the piano is that two handed thing or the two person thing chopsticks no it's not chopsticks it's the other one that has the um oh i don't even i don't i don't know enough about music to do it but you the bottom person uses two hands and the top person just uses one hand and it's this little melody i it may have been a girl thing okay well i have no idea what that is i just know i hated it but i took up trumpet after that and ended up playing in the University of Wisconsin marching band oh really which was fun yeah i went to i went to uh Rice and we had the marching owl band which is quite a it's not known for its musical abilities more so its um comedy abilities it uh uh-huh oh we had a great time in the band my uh director was heavy into the big bands so we played a lot of tunes by uh Glen Miller and Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey and people like that oh yeah well that that was fun so it was a lot of fun plus i got to get to go to all the athletic events free yeah that has its plusses for sure well which uh sixties uh rock bands do you like the best oh well the Beatles uh-huh Creedance Clearwater Revival uh Crosby Stills Nash and Young when it was still all four right um there uh Black Sabbath did a few albums that i really like is that right yeah they i know it's kind of strange um Elton John is more seventies um yeah certainly but uh Yellow Brick Road right uh-huh i love that album yeah i think i've got all those yeah i had Yellow Brick Road and something happened to it it escaped me and it was sometime in college and never have seen it again um oh i started my uh music collection in college when i started winning radio contests how'd you win radio contests well they would uh tell you to call in and be caller number nine and win so i had a touch tone telephone in college and uh i just started calling in and winning all kinds of contests i had forty record albums before i even had a stereo to play them on to play them on that's great i ended up winning about uh two hundred and thirty radio contests in two school years so i accumulated my record collection mostly from that that's incredible i've never won not one thing from a radio station i haven't tried i probably haven't tried two hundred and thirty times it was yeah well that was in Madison i i won about four times a week it doesn't have near the population that Dallas has the contests here are a lot more competitive yeah have you ever won in Dallas um yeah but not the same type of contests um oh they have contests on the radio in the morning and i think i won one of the movie mystery contests one time um they sent me a small flag in the mail that which which had postage due you're kidding me no it was a oh it's not it's probably not quite the same it wasn't much of a victory actually i did win tickets to the to a Chicago and a Beach Boys concert i saw them i went to a Beach Boys concert i like them too uh-huh um i've never been to a Chicago concert bet it was great uh yeah they were uh they were very good i was impressed yeah Chicago was great too every now and then i'll go ahead and make another tape and uh record a bunch of uh old tunes like the Loving Spoonful and Grateful Dead something from the Birds Rolling Stones uh-huh yeah i enjoy listening to those old tunes they don't play a lot of that stuff on the radio any more you have to pick the right station yeah i use my scan button a lot uh-huh whole lot i enjoy mainly the old the older rock and roll tunes rather than a lot of the new stuff the lyrics are so repetitive yeah i that i just kind of get lost in it i uh yeah i haven't made any kind of effort to keep up on recent music especially in rock and roll there's not just too much uh new stuff that's well it's not as creative it doesn't seem to be and the lyrics aren't as uh inspiring if you want to call it that yeah yeah some of the tunes used to you know you felt like you needed to go out and do something about it yeah lot of pop music out that just isn't very thrilling yeah course the head bangers i stay away from those entirely is there still that type of music available certainly is just turn on MTV any night oh no i've got small children i don't trust MTV they'll be playing the latest of Bon Jovi or White Snake or groups like that yeah yeah yeah i uh i tried when um i guess i was in junior high high school when uh Led Zeppelin was real big and everybody i tried to you know really go the whole way and i couldn't go with even with most of Led Zeppelin's music i didn't enjoy it yeah and some of the stuff you know the classics they were fine but some of it was just too heavy even then i always like the easier listening rock the the Crosby Stills Nash and Young Eagles uh in more recent Billy Joel very talented uh-huh yeah yeah Z Z Top is different very creative they they really uh made uh quite a transition they used to be almost a country band uh-huh uh playing such yeah they play they play some they get some play time on the country stations even yeah such classics as La Grange and Touche yeah and i've still got my Fandango album that one didn't get lost in college right but uh they they really did change yeah all of a sudden they became a top forty type group appealing to the younger crowd yeah yeah they've got they've now they've got some good videos uh very good videos yeah i'm kind of impressed quite creative and appealing to the younger crowd yeah yeah to the pop audience i guess you'd call it that yeah the Robert Palmer's got some creative pretty creative videos videos out too i i was thinking that yeah he's his his videos are pretty wild i like his music too oh yeah and there are some that are that get artsy to a point like Steve Winwood uh-huh yeah now see i know a little bit i know a little bit about other groups i uh like i said i listen to primarily contemporary Christian uh-huh and uh but i spend enough time on scan that i hear what it what is still on the radio well i don't know well who's uh who's who's popular now with the uh contemporary Christian music oh probably Amy Grant is the biggest one yeah she's even she's got a song right now that playing on a few of the other stations it's called Baby Baby it's i don't listen too much right yeah i've heard of her uh-huh uh-huh it's neat when you think about how she wrote it and stuff otherwise the lyrics are kind of yeah you know it's just like oh i love you and i you know this that and the other but she write she wrote when she was talking to her baby and if you've got a baby i mean it's kind of neat thinking about it talking up to your baby and to to an infant right that's interesting so it it makes it neater but well i don't think i'd ever make a song writer my secretary has tried to be a song writer she's waiting for her big time yeah well some people get lucky and i guess if you're persistent enough sometimes it works out yeah yeah well yeah i hope that it does for her she deserves it she's a nice person uh-huh so i uh well what station plays uh that type of music uh ninety four point one is KLTY okay all right and uh then there's ninety point one is KCBI they do more uh they spend a lot of time with uh oh this preaching kind of stuff right uh-huh so i like music i like listening to music so i don't usually listen to KCBI and then there's another one called Journey that's somewhere in between the two of those it's in between ninety and ninety four right i think it's ninety two maybe i'll tune in to one of those some time ninety four point one is fun all right i mean it's it's it's mainly um just family oriented stuff i mean yeah it's very its definitely Christian but it's not it's not hymns right okay you know it's not Amazing Grace every other time okay yeah i still feel like every time if i ever feel like reminiscing over the old stuff i'll go ahead and throw on a sixties tape yeah get something from from the Guess Who or  hi hello hi my name's Ken hi Ken my name's Diane and um you're in Texas right yes i'm in San Antonio everybody's in Texas God okay i'm in Rochester New York everybody else but one has been in Texas oh okay well i guess we should get on with this um did you get the message about what it was right yeah okay go great let me just hit the button okay yes okay um do you think that the Soviet Union represents a threat to us i think they'll always represent a threat whether whether or not there's an active cold war or not uh it's it's a a totally different economy based on different beliefs and and uh different priorities and uh given the the uh military powers on both sides i think it's always a threat yeah that's interesting i don't i i suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore probably not no i suspect it's probably some crazy man like Saddam Hussein right who's our biggest threat but um i wonder if they're i wonder how much of a threat they are i agree with you that that they'll always be somewhat of a threat given that they have that there's just it's just so big and there's just so much military machine there um-hum and it's and it's recognized that the two great powers are us and them and and the two great powers are always pitted against each other right but i wonder how much longer they're going to be a them i don't know they they're going downhill pretty steady huh that's yeah uh but i i agree right now they're not i don't believe they're a large threat right now i think there's always some threat yeah oh i agree i mean if we were to if if something were to happen i'm sure they would all of a sudden band together just for the sake of for the sake of uh of of unity against us or something if if if need be but yeah actually i feel kind of sorry for them right now because the people are are are uh wanting things that we have that they're not allowed i mean just some basic freedoms and and their government is not allowing it and Gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push yeah actually i noticed that i mean this this this most recent scam of his where he said where he just decided that instead of having uh instead of having i can't i can't think of the word now um if they're having demonstrations for in in favor of Boris Yeltsin he decided well i'll just cancel all demonstrations altogether um-hum so i i i think that he he he's actually he i think is becoming very dangerous yeah because he's making those people angry at him and he's also i think he's also making um the military angry at him i mean i've heard stories now where the yeah where the um the military is running around and they're sort of getting restless and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens you know when the Baltic States when they just go in there yeah to beat people up see i'm concerned that that since he's banned demonstrations altogether that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in Tiananmen Square and he's going to wipe out no telling how many of his um-hum own countrymen uh right in the middle of Red Square and uh it's going to cause a more civil war than is already occurring that's interesting i i wonder i don't know if he's he he seems the thing about Gorbachev strikes me that he wouldn't be that dumb i don't know though i don't know i mean and it it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control that's that that's that's something that really true that may sort of that military thing i was speaking of before i think that's that's certainly true i mean his military may just go out and say well we just Gorbachev said you can't do it and we're just not going to let you do it you know so um-hum yeah yeah that that's real scary actually i mean i i would suspect their own problems would keep them away from us for awhile but yeah it could be real dangerous yeah we've got our own worries at the moment so yeah right we don't need to worry about them i guess as long as as uh they're fighting each other we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us yes but wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else well sure that but that's a that's an impossibility i think yes given the the uh differences in the world and people are just too different well i don't i don't know i think that underlying underlying underlying we're all pretty probably not as as different as everybody thinks but unfortunately people people aren't that insightful right well that's that's certainly true i just they just see that this guy prays differently and to someone else than i do so therefore he's wrong and he's bad and we have to wipe wipe him out that's true i was i was discussing with someone before um this uh someone before actually one of these calls um-hum as a matter of fact about um another topic but it came up under these um this this this poem Everything I Wanted to Know I Learned in Kindergarten or something uh-huh you've read that one before no i haven't read it i've heard all about it though that this this is the idea that i think is actually very is is what i think we should all revert to the idea that um basically they said you know everything happened in kindergarten and and in kindergarten we learned to share and we learned to um play with each other we learned to take nap you know and to take naps and and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other yeah you know and that would be all if we could just do the same thing sort of with with with everybody else i suspect we'd we'd be fine yes but people grow up and they forget yeah unfortunately because because i often i often sort of wonder how having never been to the Soviet Union um how different the people there really are you know how how much everyone always thought of them as you know sort of the that's one of the places i would most like to go not right now of course but at at some point i would like to to go to Moscow and and yeah to just to see all these things that you can can see on television now and can read about that ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information i mean we didn't know right what things were like so i would i would love to go there i mean like again again not now but at some point to go see what what this is like i mean this this is am azing because this is this is an this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us like you said before as well so it'd be interesting to watch yeah i and i the the people i just feel so sorry for the people in the country that they can't they they i mean they they can't do any they can't change it they try and they there's nothing that they can do yeah that's that's and and the ones they even feel somewhat worse for even um the ones in like the Baltic States um-hum where they don't have a strong leader that you know at least at least Russia has some sort of strong leader i mean they have Yeltsin who may who may yet sort of help Russia yeah but um i mean the Baltic States i think are just sort of trapped i mean they were taken over couple of you know not too long ago yeah and then just sort of told well you're here now you're part of our country and you be this way uh i i think it's a sad state of affairs but it's it's probably not dissimilar from the uh what are they the the the i'm trying to think of the name of the the something like that in Northern Iraq oh yeah the yeah who are actually who are actually countrymen of of i mean some of them were split off into Israel i believe and some of them are in Turkey when actually um-hum they they don't they're their own people and their own beliefs and their own culture system and they were split up into three different countries right um-hum and and they're very dissatisfied and they're they're causing wars right now and yeah that yeah and that and i don't think it's that different from what the Baltic States are are going through um um um uh actually it sounds very i mean very similar they're sort of being they were sort of forced and now they just want to sort of speak up and say hey we want our piece yeah and they have other problems they have Shiite Muslims to deal with uh-huh as well as Saddam Hussein i i mean i think their big problem up there is you know unfortunately not only are they there there's more than one group fighting for the same place where they all want you know whereas the Baltics are saying well we want our own we just want this little tiny piece of land yeah yeah the the one that i think one of the women women that i work for is married to an Iranian and so she has a lot of insight because she knows a lot of the history of the the countries over there and within five or six countries there are um-hum probably ten cultures of people and and that's they don't all have their own country and and some of them are mad about it yes yes um-hum um actually uh my wife is Syrian um so i i also i know some of the history and so forth oh and and actually the real funny thing is that i'm i'm i'm Jewish we're sort of like the Middle East peace talks ourselves oh huh uh-huh so we i i know that and i've been to Israel and i know and i sort of toured the area and i know that it really is very lots of different cultures in one place i mean and and it's the same thing i it's it's almost the same thing out out in the Soviet Union right now there you know there are um-hum you can't take a whole bunch of people who just aren't the same people and don't want to be together and put them together forcibly yeah yeah i mean we did it couple of hundred years ago here but they wanted to do it um-hum so i could put the yeah and i i don't think the people here two hundred years ago were that different i really don't that's that's certainly true i mean they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs right um i wonder i wonder if now the people in the Soviet Union don't have ideas very different from that so at least they they they might the the Baltic States might be feeling the same way that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here that's possible to to escape  okay i think the crime in Dallas is horrendous compared compared to what compared now to when i first came here twenty years ago when i came here twenty years ago it was not near as bad as it is now it's terrible now my house has already been broken into once and there was an attempt a second another time i mean i can't it's horrible i'm afraid do you live in do you live near downtown no i live well i live in Oak Cliff but uh uh we never had any problem here before we we really did not in my neighborhood we're not wealthy at all know you know we don't have a rich neighborhood and when they break into our houses they don't get anything much they get a little jewelry and maybe you know a VCR's and it just irritates me to no end that somebody has broken into my house and stolen my things you know just well hum well i live i i live in in north west Garland actually west about a mile south of one ninety so we're really quite far north and the house we just moved into a house that has lots of windows and i course i have a friend Dallas policeman that lives right behind me so i don't know if that'll do any good but uh it it's interesting though that you've been broken into uh you must you must look at this whole mess a lot different did you see today that they the the police commanders got a pay raise and the the regular folks didn't no i hadn't i hadn't heard that it just on the news i was just watching a little of it just before you called it uh and they cutback and they cutback on overtime and they have to take electric clocks home and you wonder what that does to the fighting crime if if they had an electric clock on their desk they were supposed to take it home to save energy are you serious that is the city i'm serious uh Doug Clark's on channel eight that sounds like the city i worked for the city of Dallas for a while and i do know that they're they can be really strange what what what do you think why why people breaking into your house drugs they want to see they take what they do they break in and they take your jewelry and they take it and they sell it they hock it and then they buy drugs i really think it's drugs they want the money for the drugs hum so i think drugs is the root of it what time of day are they breaking in well okay i used to work second shift and when they broke in i was working at night i i work in payroll now and i work days but uh they broke in they knew my hours the police told me evidently they were watching me and they know your hours see that's what so spooky about it uh yeah and they broke in at night and uh since then i've put in a security light and i've marked everything i you know that i have i put my driver's license number on it ugly too i mean where it could be seen because i don't care don't i just don't want them to get it and hock it again well are you uh you said you're not in a in a rich neighborhood but are there are there obviously um drug people in the area no not right here i i have never even seen like uh what they call a crack house or anything i wouldn't no there's nothing like that here that i know of now i'm sure there are somewhere in Oak Cliff but i've never seen it we're not in a bad area you know i do you think they just kind of hit your house at random or but they were going down the street they've hit they've hit my next door neighbor they hit uh the guy about two or three houses down so they've hit several houses in the neighborhood one of them twice so they okay so they're really just looking for they're just looking a nice enough house to find something to steal just something they kicked my door in they literally i had a solid wooden door with a dead bolt on it and they backed up and put their foot to it and kicked it in molding and all oh that's scary because everybody feels you're supposed to have dead bolts that's real scary i have a and i my insurance paid to have the contractor come out and i we put in a another solid door and another dead bolt but it doesn't hold it well my the front door on the house i have has uh glass in it so does mine now this one does have glass in it well i i wonder you know you know it i don't know this is tough but i guess the issue is is if it's drug people what's the solution uh i don't think there is a solution i i really i really don't know i really don't and you know the police told me to get a gun and if they if you're here and they try breaking in shoot them now i have never heard policemen telling people to get a gun and shoot people before well that but that tells you how bad the situation is that tells you how bad it is and there aren't enough police and they they didn't get here till six the next morning i got home at eleven called the police immediately um-hum several times my neighbors came over immediately we didn't even know if they were still in the house my neighbor went through looking yeah um-hum yeah they advised on the phone that we'll have somebody go through and look now that's terrible and the police did not get here until seven hours later yeah well that that's real scary that's darn scary but is the is the solution uh cutting off drug supply if it's possible i guess i well or is it is it or is the solution legalizing or or is it yeah or yeah uh do you see that these people you know are they going to if if you cut supply it's going to raise the price somethings or if you uh if you legalize it it uh well you couldn't legalize everything okay i just don't see that you could but if you legalized marijuana and then uh taxed it and everything then everybody'd come out okay i think on that deal well how how expensive is um how expensive is marijuana it's not very expensive is it i don't even know i really don't know but i mean the people that are i'd be curious to if the people that are wouldn't you think the people that are breaking in are probably hard drug users are probably crack that have got a pretty high because i would think a hundred dollars worth of marijuana i don't know what it costs but yeah i should think that'd be more than a lot more than just ordinary recreation it would be interesting to see if to the problem is is is what do you lock them up for you know and then the thing is keeping them locked up yeah you know they pick them up they lock them up and then they they let them go but they don't have enough proof them they don't have anything to keep and you never get your stuff back you never get your stuff back and then we got to raise well we had interesting enough we had a in in Garland before we moved we had some neighborhood kids came by and stole uh uh drill and our saw and and i had them marked and uh we called the police about a week la ter the guy caught these kids riding a motor um a motor scooter or a a go it was a go-cart in the in the alley and he got to talking to the kids and and we recovered the drill and the saw it was but uh it it's one of those you know it was uh not a not a real expensive neighborhood uh but it's it's interesting that the the motivation and the question is what's the motivation not to steal and i i guess that's what bothers it's like the criminal you know if somebody says well let's lock him up for life well how should he you know what bothers me is the incentive that he's if you if you know you're going to be in there for life why should you just be good but if you if you say i'm not going to let you out till you have a skill and we think you're reformed well that's not how they do it they let them out when they time is served i that's right i i guess the problem is is is what it would take to do that would be more money than we it's like the school issue and which i guess we're not supposed to talk to but anyway the idea of how much money would it take to reform these criminals and lock them all up and they think these are kids kids are probably teenagers older teenagers that have been doing this around here hum they uh they weren't real professional well we don't know for sure but they hit they took they knew right where to go that's what scares me in your they went they went right to my jewelry they did not ransack my house they went right to my jewelry box and i had a ring that had my diamonds in it and my grandmother's diamonds in it that i had made and it was worth close to two thousand dollars oh my they got and they i mean they had pay dirt when they saw that i mean and i couldn't i worked in the shop then at TI you you know with machinery and i couldn't wear my jewelry i can wear it now i wear everything yeah yeah i don't leave anything home i wear everything you bet but uh everything of value they got that and the diamond necklace and stuff so they really hit pay dirt and then they grabbed my VCR also but they didn't just tear it out they very carefully unhooked everything laid everything out you know i mean it was just unbelievable well did they did you take your TV no they left two TV's and one was small they could have easily carried it but the police said they must have been on foot it looked like they were on foot they left my silver my silver was sitting here in a chest yeah but who buys silver anymore well i did well yeah but have you bought a place setting lately i have a niece that's getting married and uh she's not even um selecting a silver pattern because it's i've forgotten my wife was telling me what the cost is just incredible to you know a place setting is is yeah yeah i don't know two or three hundred dollars or something i mean your silver probably is worth a lot but uh what are they going to do walk down the street and tell everybody what would you like to buy uh a well they could they could no well they can hock it see they take everything to the pawn shops and just hock everything but um yeah i don't know they just hit the jewelry well i guess if they knew their jewelry they knew their but they did take some cubic zirconiums too i had a ring that they looked awfully real yeah and i did have a ring that that wasn't real and they took that you know and i said well how would they know i mean they they'd have to be pretty sophisticated they just grabbed they just grabbed but boy they sure hit pay dirt with that one ring luckily my insurance you know reimbursed me but i can't replace those diamonds no and and and yeah how to put a value on a ring that you'd made you know to have and that had my grandmother's stones in it you know so oh i was sick yeah that is scary but i still haven't bought a gun well see that's the thing scares me about it is um who gets shot with the guns they say that a large number of the homicides are people that know each other that uh i've forgot what the percentage forty or fifty percent it's surprisingly high that people that shoot each other know them i mean it's not like you know a  do you have any pets uh right now i have um uh two longhair miniature dachshunds i also raise uh peacocks ducks i have three different kinds of ducks and i raise geese and rabbits but the uh uh the dogs and the peacocks are pets the rest of them we we do those for food you must have a little farm then yeah yeah we live out in the country so what do you have well i'm a i'm a sort of a city dweller and i got a bunch of kids so they've got to have their pets and uh we've uh lost a few this year but we've still got a dog and a bird left uh-huh and uh the the kids maul the dog something awful they pull his tail and bend his ears and uh have a good time playing with him and the dog is pretty uh tolerant of them yeah that's that's always nice when you have an animal that the kids can play with like that how old are the kids well they're uh seven eight and uh ten huh you said your from DC and yes well right outside in uh Falls Church Virginia I have oh okay i have a my my i have a daughter i think she's in Spring Field i'm not sure she's around there somewhere she just got her a new apartment yeah and my other daughter and son-in-law live in Germantown uh-huh so there well you've got part of your family up here then yeah yeah so it's interesting to talk to somebody from that general vicinity yeah well uh i just got a new bird for uh little Deb at uh Christmas time and we're still in the process of uh getting him tamed he's a little parakeet yellow one yeah and uh we let him fly around the house and the dog being a Golden Retriever he he pays close attention whenever that bird is flying around i wonder what he'd do if he ever got a hold of him though well the the previous bird he uh got a hold of it uh two or three times and uh i found that uh well one occasion i i heard a little noise and i saw the dog walking away and i looked over and i see some feathers sticking out of his mouth oh oh and i grabbed the dog by the tail real quick and i discovered if you yank a dog's tail real hard he lets go of a bird next time you'll have to try a bigger bird yeah a bigger bird or a larger cat to take care of the dog we have some friends that in fact the ones that we bought one of the dogs from they also raise birds and they have uh two or three different kinds of of parrots and then they raise finches and parakeets and they show and he and he was showing me his parakeets and and he calls them an English parakeet and he said their marking is a little different uh-huh have did did you know that there was a difference in the parakeets well there is a a neighbor of mine used to uh uh know quite a bit about uh raising parakeets and she had uh a lot of connections when it came to getting good birds so she was knowledgeable all the different breeds and colorations and so forth yeah and knew what to look for when you went shopping for a parakeet uh i had a parakeet many years ago that uh she got for me and it lived to be a a pretty old bird and was extremely friendly uh i i couldn't keep him in his own cage he just uh flew lose in the house all the time uh but uh more recent years they moved away and i've been buying parakeets at the local pet shop and they don't seem to be as healthy as uh one's you get from uh breeders you might check uh some of the ads in the paper and see if anybody has an aviary that you might be able to buy from there yeah that seems to be an up and coming business i know out there where we are there's there's uh a person on each side of our county that now have aviaries uh-huh one of them is right out there close to us they're in the process of building it up right now i know well we found in general when you you look for breeders you don't find them in the uh metropolitan areas they you wind up going many miles out of town to find somebody that's handling whatever it is you're looking for uh-huh we went looking for uh rabbits and we had to go all the way out to Leesburg to find uh a rabbitry a few years back weren't any uh rabbits available in this area except little bunnies available at the uh pet shops and we looked at them and decided they weren't uh too healthy looking yeah that's the problem with buying them through the pet shops we have that same problem here too yeah but we've used it we just have two rabbits right now we have one doe and one buck uh-huh and she ought to be due sometime toward the end of this week on a litter we just got her yeah the uh we go we had uh one doe that we'd had her let's see it was her second litter i guess the first litter she had she lost all but three uh babies and we raised those and then her second litter she wound up killing all of them huh and it took her like three days i guess before she killed all of them so we've we had to get rid of her yeah so i i wouldn't tolerate that that's pretty unusual because we i've generally found that rabbits have been very uh very good parents yeah well this is the first time we've ever had one like that we had been down we had gone from having one buck and and three does down to one buck and just one doe uh-huh but that didn't work out too well so now we're we're trying to build it back up yeah we had a rabbit up until uh last summer and we gave him away because the girls lost interest in him and couple of them we're getting allergic to rabbits uh i uh we had a tough time deciding on a name so i named him uh Mister Tibbar and they wanted to know how i figured out that name and i said well it's rabbit spelled backwards so uh one of my other daughters got a uh gerbil and they came to me for a name and i said well name him Libreg and they said well how did you get that name i said well that's gerbil spelled backwards now that's a good idea well they wouldn't let me name the dog no that one would might get you in trouble yeah unless you called it Dog well we have been known to do that in the past we've we've got a couple of wild cats out there in our general vicinity and you know they're they're tame enough that they come up and want you to feed them but they're not tame enough that they want to stay around or come in or anything so you know those are just Big Cat and Little Cat yeah well we had uh i lived on a farm when i was growing up and when we bought the farm there was uh couple of farm cats on the property and they were sort of tame every now and then they'd let you pet them but uh one of the cats which we named Bug Eyes she had a litter of kittens and she kept t hem away from the uh the house until they were pretty good size kittens and they wouldn't let you get anywhere near them and one day i went over to i found them sleeping and i went over and picked one of them up and it boy it was like picking up a buzz saw huh i bet it was that they do that you know they they have kittens out there in the garage or out in the barn and the first time you try to get around the kittens you know it's you'd have to catch them with a uh a fish net or something because they scamper away so quick yeah but i tried again a few weeks later but this time i put on some leather gloves and my father still wondered what happened to those leather gloves did you in well it's been nice talking to you well it's been very nice talking to you i appreciate having the call and uh maybe we'll speak again on this little test that they're trying to do all right okay thank you bye-bye bye  um all right i've uh as far as i'm concerned i find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating and i think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now uh-huh oh well i tend i tend to agree uh in some ways i think it's uh i think if anything a lot of um the changes that have occurred um in some ways they're for the better because i think women should have a choice and i do believe in the being able to have a choice as to as far as what you would like to do with your life but by the same token and i know this for myself because i've worked and i've not worked um that it makes it uh sometimes it makes life more difficult i think when the roles now are less defined as far as you know what uh women should or should not be doing that it it makes it can make life more difficult there are more things to work out i know when i was working you know you have all these problems with with the child care and and with uh pleasing you know your boss on the job so you have added stresses from there and then you still have all the things that um that you need to do at home and and that doesn't change you know just because your your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't uh make those other things go away and the other responsibilities are still important um so um have you have you worked outside also and um feel that it that well how do you feel as far as uh what would be a happy medium or or what would you like to see i would like uh yes i have worked outside of the home and i was in one of those safe occupations i was a school teacher yes uh-huh and we had one child when i taught for my two year career uh-huh uh we uh then i stopped teaching after my husband's business business was established and we had two children and i stayed home with those children and yes raised those children and now that my husband has retired i am back substitute teaching which yes if anyone has ever been involved in that some days it's fun and some days you wonder why you're even bothering because your fighting for your life but i am a fighter and i've always been a disciplinarian right but yeah uh i'm i'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply i think they're going in by choice oh i believe i think so yes yes and and i have no problem with that but i think the male needs to be the dominant person and i think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand uh are not letting that happen they are very aggressive uh-huh uh-huh they're uh they almost have what i would call a killer bee killer bee instinct yeah and they have to be in charge and and i think i think they lose a lot by what i call neutering their husbands uh-huh well what do you think though um um i don't know i the the one problem i guess i have and maybe why so many women younger women now are choosing to go outside is i feel that in general in this society that being at home is not looked upon as um a job in itself whereas you know you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself but i know when i was working and i was a an engineer so i was always with men uh and they were single many of them and i tried to explain to them well my day doesn't end when i leave at i used to leave at three i keep going to eleven at night and they had uh-huh they used to look down on women that were home they'd say oh i bet you go home and you know at least you get out of here at three and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas and i used to be infuriated because they really had no idea oh sure uh-huh what was involved once i got home now taking care of them running them everywhere helping with homework the bath the whole you know everything hum um and i think that one reason that so many younger women feel in uh compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected huh and that being home is not a respectable uh position in society and there's a lot of truth to that and i don't know how you feel i don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got but i can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home and yet by the same token i think some of it is jealousy you you once in a while you hear them say things like i wish i had the choice you know i wish i was the one i would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us uh-huh if my wife had an education and could support us and the only value i see coming out of this is that children now in in a two parent home they now actually have two parents because um-hum yeah i see my sons-in-law i have a daughter who's a nurse and i have a daughter who's a beautician and i see my sons-in-law cooking right uh-huh right and dropping children off at the sitter and picking children up from school and right right uh-huh and having a much better relationship with their children than my husband ever did because he left home at five thirty in the morning and he got home at six fifteen that's true that's true and uh he ate his dinner and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted yes right so now the young fathers are having a chance to parent and i think that's an advantage and they enjoy it yeah and they do enjoy it i i see you're right i see many more men in the supermarket in the parks with their children and i think that is healthy because children uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and i think it's a a wonderful advantage for the young for the for the particularly for the males for the little boys to have a relationship with their father and and i don't think you right oh yeah yes we get into so much of the mother dominating figure if if the father has more input there yeah but uh i don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads and they have to that kind of job uh to go out there and shovel that tar and and and drive those big trucks and we just recently finished a long drive through the west a little over five thousand miles and at one point we sat down uh-huh uh i didn't realize it but i sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only and here's this young girl uh-huh with the tattoos and she was has just had just driven a load of meat from Minneapolis to some place in Arizona and she'd been uh-huh and i ask her how old she was and she was the age between the age of our daughters and she had been driving a truck for seven years and i thought gosh uh-huh i mean why would a woman choose that rough and tumble life style when yeah i guess i'm still i'm a maybe Victorian and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist in that he's a very considerate person but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and and in the home and she should vote but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote oh boy now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because i have strong opinions about things too but yea h uh i like being taken care of i like my luggage carried and my door opened and i think the young women are losing that and i think that's sad well it well that that's true there is that part too and i guess we also have to examine though and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as you know anybody else um i guess having he was raised in the south i think that's a little war condition both oh oh yeah and and you have to i guess you have to question too why a lot of the men especially i think middle age and older men why they feel that way and and i think it gets scary for them to see change also they've been used to being really to be honest in in society and in a way number one and they come home and everything's done for them and their meal is served uh-huh huh and i think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching and i think i think this reaction comes more out of fear now my husband is uh-huh sure um he's ten years older than me and but he has his attitudes are very much pro-women pro-career which is kind of interesting he comes from a culture where women are stay at home and do everything um and yet uh-huh uh-huh um he's the type that he is willing to have to take on more responsibility um if that meant you know for me to be able to uh uh advance or go back to work or whatever i'm kind of more thank you i'm kind of more middle of the road i think that when children are small i think it's okay for women to work especially there should be some a lot more part time but i think it's um i don't believe in this career you know this career drive when when they're small because i think they're downstairs Aaron i think that's very um uh-huh unfair to to children like uh engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week i refused to work more than thirty i was part-time and even that was a rat race but uh-huh uh-huh huh uh-huh i think you have to put in perspective that you know when the kids came home from school i wanted to be here i didn't want i don't want a job where i'm traveling around and and i'm away and uh uh-huh so i think you can have both it's more hectic but i think you have to put into perspective what your kids need first then i think a lot of my problem with the young mothers is  hi Ellen hi um do you uh could you tell me if you uh budget your monthly expenses no we don't really do anything formal um i kind of keep up with all the finances you know paying the bills and typically i do most of the spending too as well so uh you know i kind of have a handle on it and i just sort of know what we can and can't do and it you know it's worked pretty well i haven't really gotten into any major problems without having something formal yeah how about how about uh long term do you have anything uh for as far as as far as savings go for long term well yeah yeah we have uh you know like a typical credit union account for you know just a a basic savings thing and then uh we've got you know the IRA's and CD's and various and sundry you know long term kinds of things uh yeah how about you okay that's uh uh we used to budget when the children were small um things were and there was only one income so we had to watch what we were doing um-hum and our savings weren't that great but now the kids are all grown up and gone in fact the youngest is is uh finally getting out of college this uh May uh so we've we don't budget anymore we run basically the same as you do you kind of know what you're going to spend uh week to week or or you have your monthly bills at a fixed right um as far as electricity and telephone um we do the same thing we budget not budget but um i have a long term savings goal um-hum for retirement you know right they take out for CODA and then uh um the IRA's and then uh i also take out for um a savings account but it's it's uh um it's not really savings it's savings if we don't spend it well i know yeah it's like a floating you know if something if something comes up yeah or if you want to take a trip or something that you you plan it but that's where you get the money is yes right yeah yeah that's that's the way we work it it it it doesn't come out um it doesn't come out of long term savings like we were we were um saving savings bonds too for oh years and years and years and now i'm getting up towards retirement age so we stopped stopped the the savings bonds and we're going maxed out on CODA and then you know other things like you know CD's uh-huh uh-huh um but this other it's in the credit union and they and they take it out and it goes in there and at the end of the month but if we want to go on a trip or if something looks good or if we want to go away for a weekend yeah that's what we hit yeah or if we go out for dinner say to a nice restaurant um that'll come out of that uh-huh rather than put it on a credit card oh that's sort of the way we you know do it or at least certainly for some of those bigger things or maybe one of the appliances breaks down you know and we have to go get something new then we've got that little cushion in there that right you know will either cover it or partially so you know depending on what it is yeah so it you don't have to really dig into long term or or you know well you can't cash in a CD that's kind of ridiculous um yeah no i never go like to go into those things that are like you say long term that have penalties and all sorts of other things they yeah uh i i sort of feel like if you leave it there and you don't use it and you sort of don't see it then it's it's safe in a sense right the only time you know about it is when it comes due and they'll say you know well you've got to reinvest it back in this or that or whatever yeah but yeah it's it's it's kind of forced on you because you suffer a penalty yeah so that's yeah that's one of the that's one of the ways that we do it you you also have uh CODA yes so definitely i mean that's a good deal that's yeah where else can you get that kind of interest to start with i don't know i mean that's fantastic yeah you know they match it um my wife used to they matched hers only hers was a little bit better than ours um she hasn't been working for a couple of years her father took sick so she's been taking care of him uh-huh but that added up too i mean when when she left and the pay out came in you know if we just rolled that over and it just sits there and gathers yeah steam or momentum and you don't realize it you know it just piles up yeah that's a good deal well when you did keep a a budget all the time how strictly did you do that i mean was it real precise or um yeah we we took out actually my wife she's the one that ran the budget you know i just brought it home and she had to stretch it out wherever it was going to go but she would allocate so much at at at that time when the kids were growing up so much went for groceries um-hum so much went for the mortgage because we knew you know that was kind of fixed and electricity you could come pretty close and telephone you could come pretty close uh the oil yeah we heated with oil uh-huh we they put us on a budget they would run like uh they could really tell how much oil you were going to use uh-huh so they budgeted it at year round so in the summer time which you didn't use very little oil you were still paying the same thing as in the winter time when you're using a lot but they kind of spread the payments out yeah and we stuck to that pretty much so uh groceries fluctuated um we didn't go out to eat that often but as times went on the children got older you know and naturally salaries increased um we kind of fell away from it yeah it it became a chore well it is to a certain extent to have to try to keep up with all that yeah i talked to to uh other people and they used to have envelopes they used to stuff so much in you know so much for this so much for that so much for we never really we never really did that yeah we just allocated so much and it went into a checking account yeah and at the end of the month hopefully everything came out pretty close so we just kept certain things out for like i said for groceries um but even at that point you know she'd say oh you know we we need this or the budget's not doing this or that uh course me i didn't run it like she ran it like you run it now well and it's pretty much the same she still does the same thing everything's fixed yeah you know like CODA comes out of your out of your pay and the credit union comes out of your pay so we don't have to do anything there and the rest of it as far as my salary goes i just have it automatically deposited in into our bank yeah i do that too so we don't really see anything if if i need something i'll go and you know use the teller machine or if she needs something she'll go and she'll use the teller machine so we don't really um have a lot of cash anymore yeah yeah i i walk around sometimes and i've got if i've got five dollars in my pocket that's that's a lot it's yeah i used to take money out for gas and groceries and things like that and i don't even do that anymore i mean i just don't have that much cash on me yeah for your automobile um-hum right you mean gas yeah and now i don't know about down there but up here they got the pumps you just put your because i always put my gas on a credit card and i pay it at the end of the month yeah so you just stick your credit card in there and then it pumps whatever it pumps and it adds it all up and it gives you a ticket and off you go yeah so you don't even have to go in to see the teller anymore works pretty good then yeah yeah it's not bad so you don't need you don't need money for gasoline you don't need money you know incidentals uh for coffee when i come into work in the morning and things like that but other than that um it looks like we're probably going towards a cashless society yeah to some extent i guess so because if you're doing that you know and i'm sure it must be prevalent in your area down in Dallas um and we're doing it most most of the people up here that work have already have their their checks uh electronically sent to their banks or the credit union if they belong to the credit union yeah so they don't deal much in cash anymore either well if we so it looks like we're both running about the same yeah um maybe younger people are different i'm not sure yeah they probably don't have enough to that's right uh they don't have spendable income right yeah the poor poor things i know like you know i look at mine and he's getting out of school and i'm saying geez you know i'm glad i'm not starting out now because things are kind of tough up here for as far as uh employment goes yeah we we're having some problems here too still because you guys ran into it a while back yeah they're still laying off like over in Fort Worth and a lot of other companies too just here and there uh oh yeah it's not just yeah it's not just TI they they're doing the same thing up here and not just uh in yesterday's newspaper they said um IBM's going through they're going to lay off like fourteen thousand world wide well yeah that really is scary So it's still there unfortunately um  okay all right um i i understand that it's being proposed as a requirement for uh young people to be uh-huh to go into public service i think yes all all young Americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means yeah yeah i think that it probably would be a a good program i think probably two years is too long i think maybe a year would be the the longest that yep yeah probably you're probably right yeah two years is might be a little too long yeah and you there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place i don't think that they're gonna be serving anybody that's right that that would be the problem yeah so i think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who aren't even aware that they can do such a thing sure would um-hum um-hum to get out there and do so yeah or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it yeah uh you know college credit you know something you know i'm not sure what but i right right college credit is a good idea because i'm not sure they need to be you know paid you know a super do salary of any kind that that kind of takes away from public service right that's right yeah they probably couldn't do anything monetary but i think giving giving some kind of college credit but just you know to receive a letter in the mail that says you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday you know i'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea uh-huh no i don't think so either because a lot of people um depending on how the public service programs are set up and i'm not that that familiar with them to know i'm not either really but you know if a lot of people flat can't afford to you know that and most kids these days have gotten themselves into um financial situations where they have to be working all the time that's right that's right uh-huh that's right absolutely then you'll you'll so it's it's a really tough question young families whatever they just they just couldn't you know take off to do that that's right yeah and if you put them in public service right out of high school then that's that postpones their college for a year and that would upset a lot of people too because they just wanna get on only that's right um-hum um-hum sure would there would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that i would think yeah i you know i think it it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program but i i i think it can't be something that's mandatory it has to be something that's voluntary you know which is a pretty much the way it is now they might um-hum yep yep that's right i'm not even really sure this point in time you know what what programs are out there yeah and that's the other thing is that you know instead of making it mandatory they maybe maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and and uh you know go to the schools and um-hum um-hum do programs and tell them that we need your help and you know uh uh volunteer for such and such a time and you you have a choice of where you wanna go and and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it um-hum um-hum yeah yeah like maybe if if there was something you know they could do in their own own you know their own town or city yeah in their own community right yeah and not to have to pull up roots and you know and go somewhere half way around the world or something yeah that's true most of them probably wouldn't do something like that although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents that's right yeah that's that's true too that's true too but but they would have to be supportive in some way and i'm not sure those those programs are available to do that yeah yeah me either and you you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know right just sit around for their year or would they really you know make a contribution of some kind right exactly that's yep it's tough it's tough yeah it is tough it's and and i don't know who's even proposing it or or how they plan on implementing it if they do yeah yeah i'm i'm not sure either but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information uh you know disseminated before you say let's do this you know yeah yeah i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them you know it'd be it it wouldn't take up much much it would take up more time than anything but it wouldn't take up a lot of money they wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that yeah um-hum yeah yep that's right you go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience you get them all in the auditorium and you you know give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something and um-hum yeah um-hum and i think that they could get some results from that because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded but they don't know where to go to to to do anything yeah um-hum that's right yeah that's a real waste too it really is yeah it is it really is i don't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps like we you know we saw back i guess in the Carter administration that was that was a big thing with him right yeah yeah and i guess even back to Kennedy as a matter of fact i guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was it you know really interested in things like that uh-huh but i just don't hear much about it anymore like i say i don't even know what programs are are even ongoing now you know i don't either that's what anyway it's a tough question really is you know yeah it is a tough question okay well thanks for your time enjoyed talking to you okay take care bye bye sure same here take you too bye bye  hi Debbie how are you oh just fine what do you think of this weather oh it's been beautiful here lately oh i love it yeah i was i was glad that Easter was nice because sounds like you have a child too yeah yes you can hear her huh yeah i've i've got a two year old and we hunted Easter eggs yesterday and the weather was really nice uh-huh yeah i have a four year old and a one year old um-hum so uh yeah i'm glad it was nice too i we had a got a chance to to go outside and yeah just have a nice day the um i remember last year wasn't it raining a lot this yeah all that flooding and everything it was raining last year we had uh-huh we i'm glad we don't have that this year so far oh oh it was awfully rainy last year it was a it was a very very wet spring remember how they had all that flooding down uh south of downtown all those people got flooded out uh-huh we live just north of Trinity Mills and it floods there you know oh did it quite a lot um it's not it doesn't usually damage any businesses or anything but you can't get off of thirty five to um oh really i did to go to Home Depot and that's a problem yeah oh gosh yes uh the a lot of people go there yes or Target for that matter now yeah i'm i'm we're not from Texas we're from further we're from Missouri so it's it's uh-huh the weather down here is a lot different than than it is uh uh at home yeah oh yeah yeah we're not from Texas either um we're i grew up in Pennsylvania so oh so you're really yeah it it's not like this in Pennsylvania no i like the winters but i don't like the summers down here it it's awfully hot it's terribly hot in the summer here i just yeah when we moved down here our we had a our vehicle didn't have an air conditioner oh you're kidding i'm not well we didn't well i we really really don't need it very much in Missouri where we're from sure but um oh we suffered that first summer we traded that thing in as as soon as we could because it just it's indispensable down here to have air conditioning oh i'm sure i i think you would probably it would be terrible down here yeah i'd just i think it's a necessity we um we have i guess we bought that my car in Colorado that's where we we moved from and uh um-hum oh so we we had a feeling we'd be coming back this way and again there they don't sell all the cars with air conditioning it's you know it's really a not yeah it's it's almost a luxury oh it is you know uh we didn't have air conditioning in our house or anything oh yeah that would be nice oh i i get the the our electric bill in here July and August is just about kills me it's because it's so hot oh yes it does because i don't think they build them as energy efficient down here as they do up in the north i just really don't no i don't think so either no because of the winters winters i kind of miss winter since it it didn't do anything down here this winter oh no we didn't even have any of the famous Dallas ice storms no we didn't no we didn't did we no isn't that surprising that was that is surprising and i i it was uh really odd but we went home to Missouri at at at Christmas and i we had well we ran into town and in the ice uh-huh oh as we were coming into town and then it snowed a half a foot oh my gosh so we got our fill we went home at Christmas well you know we lived in Colorado for four years i guess um-hum so and we you know we had a lot of snow and i i really don't miss that yeah my husband says he certainly doesn't mind shoveling missing the shoveling i mean we had a big sidewalk and he didn't like that at all but yeah yeah i don't know i'd rather have the snow than the ice yeah oh definitely because in Missouri we have a we have a lot of ice uh-huh and snow but uh but the the ice is really bad because it knocks out power lines and and you just you just absolutely at least when you've got snow just about everybody has four wheel drive vehicles that's right so the ice you know that's that's a whole you don't you don't need a four wheel drive vehicle you sit and spin uh it doesn't matter right Colorado wasn't bad for that because um it so at least in Colorado Springs where we lived it was so sunny most of the time uh-huh that at right after it snowed it would almost always be a bright sunny day that's a and all of the roads would be clear you'd still have the snow on the yard yeah the kids could play in it but it'd be a bright sunny day and you know it would it would melt and you could drive around and it was really no big deal that'd be nice did you all work at TI uh TI Colorado Springs yeah yeah oh okay we got we had a lot of people from my husband's old group that moved out there really yeah and they're still they're still out there though uh that's good they scaled down quite a bit they have a lot of changes out there lately did oh they're they are everywhere they that's true certainly not localized there no but we i don't know i i don't really miss the snow i miss the change of seasons myself yes uh-huh the fall is what i really miss from Pennsylvania it just everything just kind of gives up and dies here yeah it just turns brown and makes a mess nothing pretty about it no it just the the trees just go to about the first of December and then just oh well it's time to die so it just it's just an ugly mess um-hum my folks don't live in uh Pennsylvania anymore but for a long time i would purposely go back and visit in October yeah just so i could see the trees and the fall and such a pretty time yeah my grand my grandparents took a tour of the oh of the northeast this past Fall and they really enjoyed it they said that the color was just fantastic uh-huh it really is and i think you don't this year i growing up there i just assumed that's how it was all over the country i never really realized it was such a local well yeah thing i yeah well the maple tree the maple maple trees have a lot to do with it maples make a lot of nice color yeah which there are none down here nope it's too hot for them we have a lot of Maple trees in Missouri so we have a lot of nice color too but uh the northeast really has the corner on that yeah they they do on the on the real nice color but uh i i like spring i like i like the reason it's i like that spring comes quickly here yeah i do too i'm ready to get outside and get the kids outside and yes uh yes and seems to just even my one year old it really changes her temperament she can be in here all grouchy and oh put her outside and hey she's fine oh definitely oh my my my two year old she hates to be put in indoors anyway and just um-hum well i think long winters would really mess up mess her up uh my my son born he was born in Colorado and when we first moved here um he was three i guess just turned three um-hum and for the first week we were here it was over a hundred every single day it was in July oh whew yeah and he was lethargic he really he wasn't used to the heat at all he yeah huh-uh would go outside and he'd turn into a zombie and walk around like he didn't know what was going on but he's used to it now i think he's i mean i know he certainly doesn't like the heat but he doesn't become lethargic anymore yeah well when we moved down here it was it was June and and it was just like a shock uh-huh how oh being it's just so much different i mean the heat when it gets hot in Missouri it it it'll get hot for a couple of days in the in the in the mid to upper nineties and people think it's terrible and then it and it always just goes away uh-huh it just i just couldn't it was just oppressive the heat down here that's a good word for it and i just couldn't um make my family understand this is hot uh really hot so well it's been good talking to you well nice talking to you too hopefully we'll have some more good weather but oh yeah we'll see okay take it easy bye-bye all righty bye-bye  the topic is how we can how how what is our community doing on recycling and how and do we have any ideas to encourage more recycling yeah sounds like an exciting one well it is to me uh because we're our particular little household is hot and heavy we have our glass bin our tin bin and uh our uh papers that we accumulate and recycle and where where do you live Plano Texas do they have the uh collection points where you can oh okay yes they certainly do they certainly do yes we're we're really behind the times here about all we've got is paper recycling and aluminum from cans uh North Carolina where are you oh i see um i buy i keep my newspapers and take those down and aluminum cans i keep those if i ever get them i don't drink Cokes or anything like that so i don't don't usually get any aluminum cans but that's that's all they've got set up they've got a uh central collection point at the JC Park and uh that's it well our libraries and then the uh Wal-Mart stores have the bins in back of them and when you recycle glass um-hum that seems to make a lot of difference and you have the colored glass and the clear glass and the paper and the tin cans um-hum um-hum so when you get all of that going it is it it occupies a space in your garage but you very quickly get use to it and we do not yeah and you and you and you also get rid of it so sure well you know we haul it off it once in a while and we also do not bag our clippings on our lawns we let the wind blow it off we do not fill oh yeah yeah that's why i just let it sit there and let it uh let it uh rot away and it's a good fertilizer well this is Texas it doesn't set it blows oh that's right give surprised you even have grass there lots of grass give it twenty four hours and the whole things gone there's no problem someone else is worrying about and we have somebody else's but uh the problem that bothers me more uh you know i think the communities will do as good as they are supported by their local government you know um-hum if there's if there's enough need and they have a responsive local city management um-hum it will happen what upsets me uh there was an article and i'm sorry i was reading a book at the same time it was on our Texas beaches um-hum and they are saying our Texas beaches are suppose to be the dirtiest beaches in the United States uh and it's not because of litter it's because of boats um-hum the if you could think of the basin the Texas gulf coast as a large swirling um-hum um-hum vacuum things that are thrown from ships swirl in and swirl in to our beaches um-hum yeah exactly and it kills some of our animals there's there's a professor down there that has Texas A and M has a nice size facility hum at Port Aransas um-hum and he's got all these collection of animals that he's frozen that were killed you know by plastic hum it's horrible it's a gross collection yeah i've seen i've seen pictures of uh seals that have gotten uh gotten their necks stuck in those uh plastic uh um-hum oh what do you call them they hold six packs together those plastic yes whatever those things nasty things are yeah because they they're they're playful and they think this is fun we'll stick our head through here and they get their head stuck in there and they can't get out and they strangle that's right or they starve to death because they can't swallow and i or they starve because they can't eat or drowned yeah i mean it's that's yeah that's that's terrible i mean i like seals yeah terrific well they showed one baby turtle that had been caught up in some uh plastic um-hum and it starved to death it couldn't it couldn't swallow it was pitiful yeah yeah that's what it bothers me the same thing about uh netting tuna they they get so many dolphins and well they're suppose to have be working towards around that and i well they keep saying that but i'll tell you i i saw a program not too many months ago i think it was on Arts and Entertainment or Discovery one of the two and they're talking about all these people who are making uh all these boast that you know we're dolphin free and all that kind of stuff and they just they showed them to be absolute liars uh-huh oh really yeah because you know people like Starkist they don't go out there and catch the fish they buy the fish from other people sure so and and and all these people do is tell them oh no no no no we have we have these safety nets now trust us it's our nets everything's great go back sleep and don't worry sure that's right trust us yeah they had some they had some uh uh undercover film of these people and they they netted oh i mean dozens of dolphins oh and they killed probably half of them oh that's just sickening yeah it is i like dolphins too well and the other thing uh we have an endangered species turtle a Ridley's turtle um-hum that's on the Texas Gulf Coast um-hum and there's our shrimp nets are suppose to be turtle proof so the turtles can swim through um right right huge fight going on uh the shrimpers just say great you want us to put a big hole in our nets is that what you want us to do this makes sense to us we're starving to death anyway and you want us to put a hole in our nets i can see their point i i guess if my family were terribly hungry i wouldn't be as humanistic as i am because i don't have that problem um-hum so it's it's really a hard hard issue to say what's right and what's not well i think what they need to do is to come up with a better way of shrimp farming oh this is i m ean there's there's i i don't see any reason why they can't uh i mean there's a lot of places Japan for instance have shrimp farms i mean they they they raise shrimp like they raise catfish now just just like they raise anything else and and you can do it and the uh the the collection is very easy and you don't go around killing everything else that happens to be in the area well part of the problem there is so many of the fishermen work for so little money um-hum we have a lot of Vietnamese yeah fisher people right right and yet they support their whole family on less than than i'd had for lunch on fishing yeah um-hum anyway um-hum and of course they don't have the money to make an investment like that yeah well it's and it it all goes back to the government spending enough money high enough priorities on things like that um-hum that they it would have to be government owned or supported financed if not controlled yeah there because the financing simply isn't there because it's one of those cottage industries that uh yeah and the very poor keep going but can't do anything to change yeah is right yeah they're they're they're in it for a matter of survival not sure not environmentalist well and you know they could they could be terribly sorry they're killing the turtles you know oh yeah they they probably are i probably are probably are of course i don't understand why they don't if they're going to kill them they might as well eat the turtles too and well they may do it they probably do i mean whether they like it or not they may do it you know oh turtle is good yeah that's correct turtle is very good that's the other thing wrong with the poor turtles yeah yeah yeah i had turtle when i was in Vietnam didn't know it was turtle at the time because i wouldn't have eaten it but well in my unreformed days i have had turtle soup in New Orleans and i can tell you it's fabulous yeah i but of course a boot would taste fabulous when they finish with it yeah that's true so it's no telling what the turtle really taste like well hopefully it's real turtle too well it maybe it wasn't you know who who knows what i had but it was fabulous yeah you well that's that's the other thing i mean you never know what they're putting in there you know oh this is turtle soup you know okay great sure it is sure right charge fifteen keep moving yeah why not give it a fancy name and put a high price tag on it as long as it's French it's probably it's probably Campbells or something oh dear well i don't have any my big solutions all go back to elect politicians that are more sensitive because i think we can't do it ourselves no i i no no i don't think we will because you need you need some kind of organization for it and you need clout yeah and the problem the problem i mean we've got all these environmental organizations but they're all pulling in different directions and it's the the end results is is just a nullity nobody's getting anything done and and i think there needs to be a concerted effort you know say okay here's a problem we're going to do this and you put all your resources here and we're going to do this and you put your resources here something like that i mean just it'd be great but the problem with that is you have all of these little branches off the main problem and everyone is very concerned about one thing you know like the woman down the tip of Texas that that calls her turtles and kisses everyone of them everyday she's terribly interested in her turtles she could care less about shrimp um-hum and on she goes you just kind of think everybody's got such a splintered interest yeah well that's what that's what i mean about all these groups they're so yeah that's exactly it yeah they're so uh and there's no way to to to make one group more interested or sensitive to the other group but they can be but they're not sensitive on the bottom line which means money they yeah i mean would i mean you'd ideally they would all combine together and pool there resources and and and then they could have their agenda for all these different problems and come up with solutions but i mean you know work at it as an organization not as a little group just they just don't get anywhere that's why i keep going back to the politicians that it has to have some focal spot that's right that's right we we need uh we need an environmental Ralph Nader type um-hum which exactly yeah somebody to pull the whole thing together to make it work gee right i mean we we've been at this for for so many years now and just and just and nothing's happening  so what do you think about a year or two of public service well i know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years you know free their carefree years but people that i have known that have done that i like from other countries especially Germany and Finland uh-huh yes yeah they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life and i think they're better people because of it they're much more responsible i know um um-hum the church that i go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know they're encouraged to do that missionary work and i believe i really believe that the people that do that uh-huh are better people and uh make our society better you know i i really agree with you um i uh though i've never done that myself i i'm was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to um very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there and i think it was probably one of my largest eye-opening experiences because i come from nice uh-huh middle class white suburban home and i did it um um-hum for one reason i wanted i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live someplace else so totally different than my own upbringing and i it changed um-hum it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me uh-huh and i think um in fact if if i had to do it all again i you know i i after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back hm um because so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that i'm further along and i'm still paying these college loans i i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school at thirty years old yeah um i've had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed hm uh and i thought that was you know very interesting and i i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the Mormon church yes yes but if that does that um-hum because one of my neighbors uh did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh and i thought you know that really now that i'm thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life would've probably like you said uh-huh to be able to travel someplace else whether it be the United States or outside the country i think would've been a very good um experience for me uh-huh well i think so it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school um um-hum there's kind of a selfishness i mean teenagers in our country are kind of kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and and things like that and i think that it would help people to become less self-centered and to be more responsible when you're out on your own trying to um um-hum yes um-hum um-hum thinking less of your own needs but of other people yeah and i think you know we have such a need now you know i taught you know i i think i was paid uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district and i i one of the things i taught was a computer class and these kids um-hum uh-huh um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors oh no um-hum and i and i just there you know they came from poverty they were going to continue in poverty and it was it was the school district couldn't hire many people it was very difficult for them to hire and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities right for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um things i think it's a really good idea and even if it is overseas see i never i i tell you sometimes i worry about things overseas because we have such problems right here in our own country um-hum yes um-hum it would really um and i don't the people that i've known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are they do military service which you know i don't exactly recommend but still yeah um-hum yeah they have benefited from it and um you know although i wouldn't want right um-hum military military to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but it's it has helped them and they are just a lot more mature than the average student and um-hum um-hum yeah i think it would also help them if they then went on to college i know that my first couple of years of college were um uh probably too carefree at the beginning and then at the end i had to be too serious um-hum well that's right a lot of people they flunk out or they get they just um-hum are so excited to be away from home they just spend all there time partying and they do a lot of things to themselves and that we don't really want our young people to be doing and um-hum yeah that's true um-hum that's right i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic um yeah uh because it's something that you know we don't talk about in this country probably enough um-hum uh you know because because we're so we love our freedom and our freedom of choice um-hum yep that's true and um having people but you know our like in our church it it is you're free to do that or not you're encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you and um-hum of course we think it's helping other people and so oh i think it is i really think i think um people you should i you know the kids today i teach i spend a lot of my time teaching college students uh-huh and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um their self-centeredness um-hum and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situations and i really you know they don't understand uh how other people live um they don't understand um-hum and they're preoccupied with drinking um-hum yep i think that's uh just just having a good time uh-huh and i uh a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as uh short-term pleasure oriented i guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it um-hum you know today's young people are short-term pleasure oriented and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun that's true that's really true um-hum yeah yes well i i don't know how that would ever happen here but at least um well they say i think i um have read recently that uh the Bush Administration has increased the uh funding for the Peace Corps oh really uh-huh because i guess because of the changes in Eastern Europe uh they've increased funding for the Peace Corps some of the i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense you known when they're decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps and some of the other overseas programs uh um-hum hm well i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives and friends that um i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with um-hum um-hum what my what i was going to study and at least i had some interest in a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are they say oh i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer why because they make a lot of money yes yeah that's true and they don't have a goal they don't have a goal they don't have an interest in their own field of study they're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash um-hum yeah that's very true you know how many is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country and i guess i i live near Washington being in in Baltimore it's something like one in four people in the Washington um-hum area yes area are lawyers and and i i just sort of think that's ridiculous yeah with yes there's too many people you know with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and and that how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know um-hum that's right and not enough people want to do that to for um-hum uh because of a service that they could provide you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if you're just doing it because you think that's the best way to be rich right um-hum um-hum yeah you saw statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run yeah that's true um-hum that's kind of sad well anyway well i guess i better go that's interesting um-hum okay hey thanks so much for the conversation well good luck to you i enjoyed it well thank you very much bye-bye thanks bye-bye  okay what kind of books do you like to read for enjoyment uh mainly the the books i read are uh business related uh-huh or self improvement um i've got a a uh small company on the side that i that i do things with so uh a lot of the reading that i i do has to do with um how can i uh do better at at my small time business uh what kind of business is it important issues such as a you know taxes and uh-huh business expenses and all those kind things well that sounds interesting that sounds fun what kind of business is it um i've got a uh small distributorship uh i uh uh-huh sell a uh healthy cookie on the side really and uh i have a few health food stores that i send it to i can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can so i can get a deal from the uh from the main from the supplier uh-huh well that's interesting and then i distributed them and then i can i get i can sell them at a cheaper price plus i've got a uh drinking water system business that i've had on the side for years that i've done a what a drinking water business uh yeah yeah oh really well that sounds interesting my mom always wants me to open a health food store but i'll i'm not really into it i don't know the information i don't know that much about it so anyway but well that's interesting i personally i like mostly um if i had a book of my choice i like books i go to the library a lot and it seems like i always i never go to the fiction section i mean that to me is just ridiculous it's like life is to interesting to read fiction but uh-huh i always get books like um i like to quilt well i'm not into quilting but i check a lot of books out to learn how i just haven't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book but i like to um can and do food preservation and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff and i like to check books out like that and i always come away with i'm a Christian and i enjoy reading books about um i like i have a real heart for people involved in cults uh-huh and so i have a real you know heart for them and i'm going to bring my Mormon neighbors some Amish bread today and that's just where my heart is so i read a lot of books on that and you know Christian books written by people about you know to help you out and stuff and i read the Bible i don't read the Bible as much as i should but but i think i would always think that no matter what i did so but i do enjoy reading that and so pretty much we have different interests i think in reading sounds like it but and i have a neighbor with a big motorbike and he likes to run down the street with it and you you can probably hear him but um i don't know so do you enjoy reading anything like that um uh-huh um i haven't really read anything like that in in in years there was a time when i was really into the home things and i did uh had my own garden and i did canning all those kind of things that was when i was about uh ten years younger uh-huh and uh had thirty or younger is that what you said about ten years younger yeah oh ten years younger oh that's funny and um uh the the problem that i've had in the past with uh my children growing up and moving out of the house and and still having three left at home out of the five um i've uh-huh tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in in reading more and and spending more time at the library and it i've been moderately successful uh-huh uh with my daughter and with my son they both have different interests in books but um they they uh they do read them um i have some books on on health that i read all the time one's on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing but yeah i i'm oh really yeah Maureen Solomon i had a a friend of mine has a book by her right now called Foods That Heal uh-huh they eat a lot of it you know you can take your vitamins and she was telling me to take zinc so anyway i've been taking enough zinc you know to kill a horse probably i hope it doesn't hurt me but anyway i did read one chapter of that there's a uh a couple called um oh i'm going to forgot his name now uh Dirkson uh-huh um and uh there's a book called Life Extensions i don't know if you've ever heard of it no i haven't okay it's a book called Life Extensions there's also a book called The Life Extansion Extension Companion uh Dirk Pearson and uh-huh oh i forgot Sally's last name anyway it's a couple i've i've seen them on TV and uh they have they are pretty down to earth about uh what you can take and and what you can't take and um the quantities and the quantities what are good for you what isn't and um Life Extensions what's the name of it again Life Extension uh yeah he's probably about forty years old now i saw him probably seven years ago on Johnny Carson Show um-hum uh-huh oh really and uh i was pretty impressed he had a he before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs uh-huh you know based on how well it was performing and then he embarked on this uh vitamin treatment and then every year he had the same tests run um-hum uh-huh and at the age of thirty two i think it was his um heart was that of a fourteen year old really and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age and of course Sally uh isn't a very big woman i mean she's you know she appeared to me to be very petite and um she took a horse shoe and and turned it turned it into an S um-hum oh really and uh it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength and of course doing isometric exercises uh together they both exercised about five minutes a day doing isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises really i know there's not any food that you can get and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore and i know my my husband's uncle owns a big some acreage in a Eastland Texas which is in West Texas uh-huh and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly you know and uh we get black eyed peas off of it and stuff but yes i know that you know the further we go from Adam the worse the food is for you but God still somehow makes us all be able to still live i think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many generations well the last couple of processed foods you know i mean but i don't know i like to i like to my i like to be able to eat really healthy you know what am saying and i guess i'm going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i do don't think we're going to restore the earth to you know i think Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be uh-huh but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because i'm always looking down my plate and i think man isn't this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment but i do take some vitamins on the side and i do like reading books like that i just i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth and we're going to restore the earth i just don't see that i think i mean think to think that is almost it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the you know what i'm saying it's to big than us and i think God's in charge and God's going to restore it when he wants to so sometimes i get bogged down in the yes you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking but you know there's a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it and you know and try and do what's what i can do out of it that's practical but anyway so yeah there's i've i've read a lot of things um since i got involved in the water business back in eighty three um and it's amazing that the the legislation they have uh-huh um for food that doesn't apply to water they don't consider water a food and uh the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be you know they wouldn't be able to sell it to you uh-huh through your pipes because it's toxic um chlorine it's toxic it's a i don't know if your on city water city water has chlorine in it chlorine causes cancer because it's what oh uh-huh uh-huh they know that they've proven that um yet their saying well we're putting such low doses in there that well you don't have to worry about dying from it the problem is that i've that i've read books that uh-huh uh-huh uh have proven that there is a link between the ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack um and if you look at the history of heart attacks heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty really and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water really you know i bet that's why we have some friends that eat only i just took this Amish bread out of the oven man it's going to be good i had a starter that friend of mine made anyway uh i had a friend that read a book on that and um i've all my relatives my mom you know you probably read Back To Eden or something i don't know we read a lot i know people have read all those books but the um they drilled they drilled a well i don't know how many feet but it's three or four times deeper than it needed to be uh-huh and so their water comes out they live in Grand Prairie but it's they live kind of in a the planes go right over from DFW so it's not real developed and so they have a probably half an acre yeah i'm very familiar with the area and yeah and they drilled this well and the water comes out at thirty two degrees so it's kinds of neat would that be healthier do to do that to drill your own fresh water well like that it depends a lot of uh a lot of things were thought that uh as you know the farmers thought okay we got chemicals we're putting chemicals on the field well the ground will naturally filter out the  okay okay um what do you think about the war recently the war you mean in terms of the economy or uh-huh uh the economy the our soldiers going over uh just everything oh i thought we were going to talk about social changes is that is that what you're kind of directing it oh okay okay well um yeah yeah that's the first thing i thought of i don't know well i think it's caused a lot of you know big difference between when people had gone to war before like compared to Vietnam because i mean i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that right right right and you know and support the soldiers so i know that uh i've heard people say that you know when people that went to World War Two you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war but then in Vietnam yeah that was totally different you know you couldn't be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably yeah yeah and now if you've served in Desert Storm you probably would be a a good candidate yeah it would be like a bonus for your image or something exactly exactly exactly yeah it i'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income oh torn apart oh yeah just drastically altered we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a just had a new baby and uh they would have she would have had to go back to work and um-hum right i think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds so it that's also a good reason why it it or good that it ended as soon as it did yeah yeah i think the biggest change that we've seen um in in my life or whatever lately is the economy and things are so tight and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years and you know oh okay um-hum exactly and it seems like everything is raising every everything that can be cigarette not that i smoke but cigarettes yeah um uh stamps i mean it seems like ever exactly everything single thing that we do even dog licenses i mean yeah is higher you know yeah and they just raised the minimum wage today but that's not like you know going to effect too many as much as they should have raised it i'm sure yeah yeah but uh so that's the hardest thing for us and um we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home we have a three year old and a two year old and i'm trying to stay home as long as i can uh-huh right but you know every week it gets harder because i could go out and be making money right right you know so that's a big uh stress i think you know for the social changes in our family uh-huh yeah i don't i don't have any children or anything right now i'm uh i work as a news reporter in Waco and so i get to see i got to see a lot of not firsthand but oh i see uh probably a good part of the war um as far as what people thought about it and a lot of things like that so uh-huh yeah yeah well it it was kind of amazing people were coming to me to ask me you know what's going on you know like i knew or like i sat in on the meetings or something yeah you have an inside track or something yeah yeah so i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about you know changes in in the war and everything so that was pretty interesting yeah yeah let's see what other social changes in the past ten years oh i guess between men and women i've seen a lot of changes in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career be mom be everything superperson yeah exactly be everything be supermom exactly yeah because i know you know i i really get pressure from because i have a career also and i get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues that why am i staying home uh-huh right and you know whereas before that never would have happened people would have said why are you going to work where as it would have been exactly um so that's kind of a difference for us i think there's more pressure to um not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family right the roles are changing a lot so he's yeah he's gotten a lot uh you know you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all but in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up uh-huh right so it's now he has the pressure too of being super dad and super career and and even you know i think a lot of the movies we see now kind of kind of play a good part in our changes because you see that they have The Three Men and a Baby type movies yeah that's true mister mom and and i think you know to yeah and then you have the women uh detectives now and you know different roles just in what we see and so we probably want to do that even more now uh-huh yeah yeah you know since the women's movement in the well seventies and you know we've come a long way but i think it's still a still good ways to go that's true yeah yeah i think there's still i i know that um i grew up in Chicago in the sixties and was part my family was real liberal and i think there's a lot of um so uh-huh kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society and race relations and things like that and right you know i think there's so much prejudice still there and it's kind of more covert now people used to be more clear and say you know well i believe in this or i believe in that and now yeah exactly exactly you know i think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice but people think oh we're in the nineties we're beyond all that you know it's just not as exactly but it's i mean like i say we've come a long way but we have i mean twice as far to go still yeah yeah and i don't think a lot of people you know realize a lot the plight of a lot of people yeah you know and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky-dory to you but there's so many more people that are homeless and yeah but there's so many more people exactly that you don't even and that you don't even see or know about yeah it's real easy to get isolated in your own little community you know because when when i was growing up in Chicago um we were in a real ethnic neighborhood and there were people from all oh oh yeah first generation Chinese German you know all different nationalities and everything and now we're kind of like in Lewisville Miss White Little suburbia you know uh-huh uh-huh yeah i mean i don't even know anybody that you know from any place other than Texas hardly you know yeah i grew up in in Brooklyn New York and so i was just i was just surrounded you know by black people because i'm Black and so you know i lived that's where i lived oh boy yeah yeah and so now i i feel lucky actually because i've almost lived around everyone i've i went to UT to college and so they you know they have oh a lot of different people go there different kinds of people and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see you know some people have lived in Lewisville all their life you know and so they don't get to see yeah yeah yeah and that they they think the whole world is like that exactly and that we lived in a dorm my husband and i met in graduate school at Indiana University and i was ours was uh international coed you know coed dorm and there were twelve hundred students they're graduate students from all over the world uh-huh uh-huh and once we came here it was like gosh i just miss that because it really is exciting to be around people of different exactly it is cultures and different backgrounds we got invited to one guy practically roasted a goat in his in his dorm if he was from Iran or some place i don't know where but um you know oh my gosh well there's so many people who have never you know even gotten to do that so that's great my sister was telling me yeah yeah she met a girl she's going to the University of Pennsylvania in in Philadelphia and uh she just met a girl from um i think oh uh-huh Barbados or Jamaica or something like that oh and i mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time and everything and she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars so my sister had to take her shopping and yeah yeah you know show her what to wear show her how to match up colors and i just thought that was so very exciting you know to go and and just witness oh gosh yeah yeah you know this girl just coming to America type thing you know so you know i would have loved it the opportunity to do that yeah really that is part of the change i think that i've seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now but kids have to have so much i mean i even get caught up in it with our kids even though i buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas i mean oh yeah uh-huh people have you know think they're kids have to have five hundred dollars worth of toys they think they have to have everything they have to have the latest cereal about you know just oh yeah it's just yeah that's ridiculous too when i first moved here i was only thirteen but everyone had a car in school oh gosh you know and i couldn't and i just couldn't believe you know i was from New York and so you know we rode the bus and if you had a car yeah yeah me too in Chicago we didn't i didn't even date a guy that had a car until i was in college exactly and if you had a car there was nowhere to park it anyway or you know it's just you just didn't have a car but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools and i couldn't understand it you know all the kids had cars and they you know have to have a car yeah yeah yeah oh gosh my kids are going to be hating me i guess i'll give them a bike and say here's it till you can afford to pay the insurance you know so that was yeah yeah right really or live really close to school and have them walk yeah no kidding but uh yeah a lot of changes yeah so well did we cover it everything i think so okay i guess i'll get back to my laundry okay well it's good it's good talking to you okay bye-bye you too good luck bye-bye  okay i don't know about you but i hate to do yard work and i pay somebody to do all of my yard work really i like it yeah do you i i like um um um working with flowers and stuff like that oh well i i i don't mind doing like gardening or just stuff like that but i'm just regular cutting the grass and oh just mowing the mowing the yard i always told my dad when i was a kid and he made me do it i said i can't wait until i'm old enough so i don't have to do this anymore that's probably why you hate it so much because i always had to do it and so i just pay someone else to do it and they do the they do the cutting they fertilize they um edge and um i think this year i'm going to have some landscaping put in uh-huh so i don't know i don't i i'm single and and and and so i don't know i don't if i had a a man around to do it it might be different i don't know i kind of enjoy working out in the yard i i enjoy working out in the yard i mean in the summertime it's hard here because it gets so hot pardon me do you um-hum you have to like get up at six o'clock in the morning if you're going to mow the yard and not faint while your doing it do you cut the grass and stuff yeah you do you live by yourself no no i'm married but you still do it anyway well we both do sometimes you both do it that's nice do you have um a lot of flowers and stuff well we're we're moving to a new house and so we'll we'll have to get started over there oh decide what we're going to plant and everything at the at the old house we had a lot of roses um those are pretty i i used to have a house that had a really it was really well landscaped and i i enjoyed the flowers and the and the trees the things this um-hum house doesn't have very much it has some trees but um who lived here before didn't put in anything in the way of shrubs or flowers but i think i am going to have that done yeah have that done this year because i do enjoy looking at it i just i'm not i don't tolerate the heat well it does get really hot here i much prefer to stay in the house in my air conditioning and look at it without working in it although i have i did try one year um out here in Dallas but i lived i used to live in San Antonio and i did try growing having a garden where i grew tomatoes and vegetables different vegetables and that was kind of fun uh-huh yeah to get out and work and that we tried that last year and but we hadn't lived here in Dallas for you know long enough to to remember that you have to do like um i have this sister who lives in Florida and she plants her garden in January harvest in May uh-huh uh-huh plant again in um late September ooh and then harvest like in December yeah that's right because the summertime you just can't grow anything and we tried to plant in like end of March or April and everything just toasted i mean it just isn't that when when are you i thought that was when you were supposed to plant oh here it gets so hot i mean this stuff just burns to a crisp what when when are you supposed to plant it when when are you supposed to plant then probably late January really right when it just as soon as it stops freezing um i didn't realize that because you know i mean last summer the only way you could keep something keep a keep a garden growing last summer was to water it all day long every day and because it would just it would just burn to a crisp yeah yeah it does eat up the water eats up your water bill i know that oh yeah but um i don't know i've i i just prefer having someone else do it to me um you know i'd rather spend my time doing other things um-hum yeah and i know my dad always enjoyed it he loved to work in the yard why did he make you do it uh he made us do the grunt work well so okay you need to get married and have kids and then when they're big enough you can have them go do the yard and you can do what you want to do that's what he i can't tell you how many times i heard that that's what he yeah i i can't tell you how many times i heard that and my son only my son only five so he's not old enough yet to send out to to the do the yard work no but he will be about five more years maybe but um i don't know i don't know really it's interesting i don't i don't know part of the reason i think is that i don't know anything about it when i had my other house and it was already landscaped and i you know i didn't know what to do and how to take care of the things and you know i learned a little bit but um yeah i heard roses i heard that roses are really difficult to grow and they really take a lot of well i i didn't seem to have that experience i mean they were already there but we just fed them and watered them you did you have any problem with bugs or anything like that no well that's good have you have you ever grown any vegetables oh well like i said we tried last year but we didn't do it right um tomatoes tomatoes and it's going to be too late this year by the time we get moved so we'll probably wait and maybe in the fall we might plant a fall garden this year yeah um hum but we're not going to try to do anything during the summertime because it is just too hot it's an interesting i think it's an interesting you know it's an interesting hobby if um you know to have i just have never taken the time to learn to learn very much about it and um-hum you know but like i said i don't tolerate the heat and the yeah some of it's fun but the cutting of grass and i just don't enjoy that yeah that's what i said you know summer during the summertime you've got to get up at six o'clock in the morning oh i see to do it before you know before it gets hot and one time last year i remember we were planning on doing that and it was eighty degrees even then at six o'clock yeah yeah i know oh it was just awful and so humid have you had to start your work on your yard this year yet cutting it and stuff oh no because were fixing to move i just had mine done for the first time last week yeah really so it's getting to be i i usually have it done about every other week yeah and i don't know now it's not growing real fast it will pick up yeah oh yeah it's just getting green i prefer to see green than brown um-hum but well it was nice talking to you nice talking to you too and good luck on your moving and your garden thanks thanks oh thanks bye-bye bye-bye  hi Mary have you gone visiting uh any new restaurants lately hi well i haven't been to any new ones but i have uh several that i frequent uh mainly because of specialties in foods and i have so many so many foods that i prefer uh that i enjoy such as oriental foods i don't like Japanese food but i like all Chinese food uh-huh i i tend to get stuck in in and i find a place that i like and i stay there um i some of the things i like are atmosphere um ah sounds familiar food price um but mostly i think you know service and atmosphere are the two things that you know i don't minds paying little bit if if i don't have to wait too long to eat and if the service is good the food is good yes yes and i find like the the places that i'm going to now um because whenever you find a place that's good other people have already already found the same kind of a place and so sometimes i have to go to this place in uh where i know i have to wait at least fifteen minutes sometimes a half hour and um they have little bar there so we sit there and um sipping on some mixed drinks before we get to eat oh that sounds uh very much like one of our very very best places to get steaks uh-huh uh and they open at five and if your not there at five thirty you'll probably have about an hour wait wow okay So this and they have a bar also which is always crowded as can be but it's it's an specially fine restaurant and when you consider they take no plastic or checks strictly cash and they've been in business oh for at least forty years uh that's they uh-huh oh they must have some good food there yes yes it it's their their steaks are exquisite they also have uh excellent uh liver which i happen to like uh-huh and um those are the two specialties which they have that and their stewed tomatoes which are well known all over the Dayton area uh i had uh an opportunity to visit visit the Dallas area and uh i went to some steak houses while i was out there and there was this one place that i visited that was really unique The waitresses were dressed like little cowgirls oh and the i don't remember the name of the place but for a menu all they had was a it was like a wooden block uh-huh uh-huh and and um i think for food they had steak and beans and they had three different sizes of steak The cowboy the cowgirl and the right i forget the the other one the he-man or something like this and um and i i i found it uh to be very good The atmosphere was good it was a lot of fun yes right well one of the nicer restaurants supposedly that opened up here not uh too very long ago called Harbor Lights specializes in fish uh-huh huh and uh the atmosphere is fantastic and i was there with it's a group um that uh we were having a going away dinner for a friend and there were twelve of us and i the the food that uh we ordered each of us was quite good but the service was horrendous oh no kidding and the the waitress never once came behind me um um on our side of the table she reached across the table she never once asked if we wanted coffee we had to grab onto someone else they didn't uh-huh refill our water glasses um someone had only eaten a portion of their food and wanted to take it home and asked to have it boxed and she just pitched it out and then when she finally did bring something um to replace that she practically threw it at the person oh that's too bad see how one one place one person can make a big difference on whether you go back to the place again yes and oh absolutely what made me angry was that when there are groups such as ours there were twelve of us they automatically put the tip on the bill uh-huh wow okay and i'll tell you we had some very unhappy people who were so unhappy with the service and resented paying fifteen percent tip when they had such poor service yeah oh that's really that's really too bad i had um one place that i enjoyed going to but my my girlfriend didn't like it and then i had asked her about it and she said um but that the reason why she didn't like it was that she felt that the place wasn't cleaned well um they had um younger kids you know wiping the tables down and they weren't very oh yes right right well trained i guess and they didn't do a very neat job in cleaning the tables off and when the waitresses came they she just put all of the clean utensils and everything right on top of these dirty tables oh well it one thing that gets me is when you see them do putting out the um the um knives forks and what have you and when they put them down they hold them by the edge that you are going to put in your mouth yeah right and that really up sets me when i see that i i can certainly understand that in fact in this same restaurant that my girlfriend doesn't like to go to she um she frequently finds food oh struck onto the utensils as where she's got to go through uh three or four uh different um utensils and the the the waitresses are very nice they'll they'll keep exchanging it ah uh-huh yes but yeah but they don't look you know like she had complained about it one time and the girl said she was sorry she picked up these utensils and and when back and grabbed some new ones and then put the new ones back down and the new ones looked worse than the ones that she took away so she is not even looking you know and oh no no and actually you know those are the kind of things that should get taken back to the management yeah um because the the the waitresses have no control over the the way the dishes are and cleaned in the kitchen and if they're not cleaned off well when they go threw the dishwasher food just doesn't always get washed off and it sticks on there and then when they dry them that's true um if they air dry them or heat dry them it dries it right on it and that's terrible uh-huh yeah yeah yeah i agree the management should know about it but the waitress should especially if you ask them to take something back to look at the ones that she's uh bringing over to you instead of just grabbing a handful and bring them over again yes i agree with that but just don't ever get a glass that has lipstick on it oh that is terrible i had that happen only once i don't remember where but it's always oh boy one time enough for me to be aware of the situation and i look at every glass that i get how about fast food do you enjoy um fast food restaurants yeah i don't mind that um my husband never cared for fast food so we didn't go that often but you know i have no problem with uh going to a McDonald's or a Wendy's or uh uh-huh a or a Long John Silver's or any of those once in a while not often but once in a while uh-huh yeah yeah i enjoy it once in a while but i enjoy relaxing while i eat you can't really do that in these fast food places yeah oh yeah that's that's very true now once in a while if there's a good ballgame like there's going to be tonight with Duke and uh um Kansas City uh-huh uh Kansas uh cause see now i would enjoy having a pizza uh-huh and just sit and watch the game and a have a pizza and a beer that i would enjoy uh-huh at a at a restaurant or at home no no at ho me just have it delivered yeah we we have number of our pizza places deliver and i assume that you have that there also at home oh yeah we're just beginning with that it um it took one of the pizza companies and i think it was um gee Domino's Domino's was the first one to start yes yeah right after they started i guess the other uh businesses lost money and they all began doing the same thing yes yes uh we have Domino's we have Pizza Hut and then we have a couple of other smallers Little Ceasars and Juan's Pizza they're all in the general facility where i live and so i can and then yet my most favorite one doesn't deliver uh-huh we have no which one is that uh it's called Marian's Pizza but i think it is local huh and the yeah we have Popaginos did you ever here of Popaginos no okay we have a that's a fairly large chain in New England we have a a Popaginos um and they had not been delivering up until the time where uh Domino's began delivering and within a matter of six months they started up there own delivery service um-hum right yeah that makes a big difference well we have a lot of businesses going out of business uh in this area and i don't know whether it's necessarily uh nationwide but many of the smaller stores grocery stores card shops uh restaurants smaller restaurants i can't compete with some of the larger ones and they are all going under uh-huh it would seem to me that if that if i owned a business the thing that i would want to do is a is a get little survey uh like we're doing with each other and and encourage people to to give that information back to the management yes yes absolutely and then maybe somehow turn what ever negatives around into a positive well i um uh i've been retired from education for uh oh what eight years and i do i have a bunch of had i should say a bunch of little jobs such as a sales associate um of women's uh-huh specialty dress shop and um i was a manager part-time at a card and gift shop as well as teaching in a modeling agency and modeling so uh-huh the card shop just went out of business we've been there almost a year almost two years but uh and the store was precious everyone liked the store they liked the kinds of cards and what have you but the location was so poor uh-huh huh and it was in a shopping strip that had a grocery store on one end that took them almost four years to really get that going and that strip filled up but Kathy selected the middle store in the middle strip and there's still no stores on either side and it's been over a year and a half yes and and it's sad because it was it was a nice store and she was such a lovely young gal to work for i just feel very bad oh that's too bad it um  hi hi this is Norma Smith i'm Jerry Crow from Dallas pardon i'm Jerry Crow from Dallas hi Jerry uh where where you from i'm in Blacksburg Virginia in Virginia golly right down uh southwestern part of the state in the mountains oh i had first had thought this was just Texas Instruments but apparently it's not just Texas Instruments oh no no they've uh got volunteers apparently any all over the country yeah i've talked to some people from Attleboro uh Massachusetts uh-huh uh several of those people are you a TI employee uh-huh yeah i work in Lewisville which is just outside of Dallas i see uh-huh well our topic is uh TV shows you ready to get started well TV shows yeah what we like about them our favorites and so forth uh yeah i guess i am okay i'll go ahead and punch one okay fine Jerry okay i guess my favorites are probably the the uh news format programs like Hard Copy Sixty Minutes Twenty Twenty uh Current Affair things like that uh-huh we watch a lot of that also we watch uh CNN a lot yeah and then i think one of my favorite shows is LA Law yeah we don't have cable unfortunately so we just get but we've got plenty of local stations to look at uh-huh but uh uh we have cable here yeah about the only reason i would want cable probably is is for some of the uh sports programs i see that they don't show local right yeah like HSEN ESPN but the music movie show uh cables or movie channels they show the same shows over and over and over well that's right and we never have signed up for those i just haven't been interested in what they generally have on and um and they're usually would be just as happy not to have them in the house yeah but uh do you have small kids no nope we uh our family's grown in fact we've just been retired for about a year we took early retirement and okay oh just really enjoying ourselves i wished i could do that i've been TI thirty two years is that right yeah but i'm only fifty seven well so i've still got a few years to go uh my husbands fifty five and i'm a couple of years older well he's fifty seven i'm a couple years older than that time goes by yeah yeah but he was with IBM fa thirty years yeah and decided he'd had enough of it well i've had enough of it but unfortunately they don't pay enough for early retirement do you still have children do you have children at home no huh-uh no all my kids are grown married right well our daughter in Texas is working for TI uh on a part time basis so that's how we found out about this calling uh-huh yeah but uh every once in a while i like to watch some of the old movies i watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night um-hum well we watched the ACC play-offs or i guess yeah oh yeah uh in in fact it's on tonight rooting for Duke University rooting for Duke University yeah yeah it ought to be a good uh good game tonight yeah that's on right it's on again tonight it it doesn't start until seven o'clock our time so we still got another hour um-hum uh are you all behind what time is it there it's six o'clock here now it's uh it's seven o'clock here right seven o'clock so you all are behind us right we've just been watching the national news yeah but uh i wish our time were like yours and then we could get i like to watch Johnny Carson and watch the eleven o'clock news but it makes it so late yeah makes it so late well we're fixing to go on daylight saving time uh next this next weekend uh-huh i think we do to so we have to run our clocks up forward an hour and i sure do hate to loose that hour of sleep in the morning i hate it too i just would rather stay the way it is yeah but uh well i guess like like like i said my favorite show what's your favorite shows or you like the news formats i like i like the i like some of the dramas yeah shows and i like mysteries yeah i like uh the true life adventures too but uh-huh we like uh we get the uh Financial News Network yeah and we like to watch that check up on what's happening with all the stocks and yeah i i don't uh watch too much of the of the uh network shows i all i like to watch uh let's see some of the the uh prime time shows that i like to watch like i said or other news formats but then every once in a while i'll watch Star Search uh-huh uh but uh not too many of the situatio n comedies do i care for no i don't care for those and i'm definitely not a soap fan too much the only crazy comedy i really like is Saturday Night Live yeah or uh i do you ever watch that yeah and i like uh Totally Hidden Video uh-huh we don't watch that much and uh Super uh what is it uh uh Bloopers and Super Practical Jokes right uh-huh but um uh i don't know how people stay at home and watch soaps and get involved in them but no i don't either i just don't have any interest i guess plenty of people do yeah they had a program on the other day about people that were addicted to soap operas yeah in fact i think you can even uh order a magazine that keeps you up to date every day of what happened on every particular soap in case you miss it uh-huh but uh that that's not real life to me so uh no i think it'd be an awful waste of time yeah well i enjoyed talking with you and well enjoyed it too Jerry and and how how's you all's weather up there you cold uh today it was pretty chilly and windy yeah the sun was out bright but it was kind of cold yeah i guess it was probably in the fifties but there's a strong wind well you yeah did you have a good Easter very nice we had company very nice yeah we did too i told my wife i sure do wish they'd gave us Monday off rather than Friday off oh because Sunday was really busy uh-huh you had company yeah company and then we went and visited the daughter and and uh didn't get i don't guess we got to bed till about eleven thirty oh i see and then having to get up and go to work the next morning uh-huh yeah that makes it hard well you have a good day well you too good TV viewing oh okay bye-bye bye  well a large organization offers uh usually a good vacation time and they offer uh holidays and and medical and dental programs sometimes as well as just the ability to takeoff uh personal leave or whatever you need and one thing that i've found coming in handy lately is juror duty uh being paid for that or or at least a full days pay plus whatever the the local government pays you it's nice to be able to do that and not have to concern yourself with your job as it were especially if you get on a case that's true so uh and you get sequestered or something then you're there for months um-hum when when you get sequestered and you're there for months right that would be uh a true problem of course in my job i don't know who would do it while i'm gone that long we're desperately trying to find time to uh train someone else to do it but i feel certainly it would still be there if if not burying me but uh it'll be there when i get back uh flex times another benefit that i i like that TI's been doing uh though officially they just started it uh uh relatively recently uh we were always given the privilege with our supervisor that was there we were really small shop and there was only one shift so we didn't interfere with anyone and he liked the idea of having someone there early enough to handle third shift's concerns and late enough to handle second shift and so he allowed us to come in basically as we as we wanted to and as it worked out two or three of us were there about six in the morning and yeah and later on well eight to nine o'clock some other ones would show up and that puts people there at the five o'clock time frame and it really worked out well and then then of course they came long and sanctioned it and and actually made it a little worse in that they said they didn't want any of us starting before six thirty so uh it wasn't too much of a blow but uh the people that we were interfacing with didn't like that too well yeah right they have to hang around a little later to get there third shift work in but uh it's it's nice to have flex time especially being able to take off in the middle of the day and uh not hurt your pay if you come back and finish your eight hours that's that's a real benefit what have you found that you like in a big organization well as as you say the the um benefits are the biggest part of it i think that today with costs uh for medical insurance and eyeglasses and dental and all that it is a boom a a a plus to have that even as far as your uh salary goes you know along with it because it's not out of pocket money and it they also have good insurance uh life insurance policies good retirement Dakota the um jet funds all that stuff i think you know the IRA's um-hum uh the profit sharing the stock options there are a they offer a lot of ways for you to save money too if you have any extra you know that like the uh code over the two for one type of thing or they match half i guess it is um-hum right and um i think that uh a a lot of it's the personal recognition that the company gives people if they do a good job uh the incentive you know to want to do a good job and the um MIR awards banquets and things i think they do a lot as far as trying to motivate people and they're uh meetings to keep you full informed um-hum you don't find that much in small companies because you can kind of interface but when you get a big company like ours i think it's great that they take the time to you know give us a monthly meeting to tell us what's going on right that type of thing um uh do you we interface kind of like uh on the tip teams and things i think that's a good deal right it gives you a chance to feel like you're a part of a group or the organization and that you're heard and know and if you have ideas that type of thing um-hum do you find that your vacation time do you manage to use it up or do you end up into the must use okay oh i use it up there's a number of us in our little group that end up having to take the must used five or six of us in fact uh just tend not to get around to taking it all at once and uh by the end of the year it kind sneaks up on us and i managed to carry forward the maximum amount there is and and uh i'm still doing uh my wife works uh half of a half of one day one day a week so on Thursdays do you have a mandatory excuse me uh do you have a mandatory shut down no we don't have uh we do have mass vacation but in our group it doesn't apply we're so busy year round yeah oh that's why see see you can you're able to do that but we haven't got much choice right too that's the if i had to say one thing negative that would be it because i feel like you know you earn your vacation time and you should be able to take it when you want to take it when you want to yeah but we're not allowed to we have to take two weeks when the company shuts down you know right and i can understand it from there point of view in on the one hand because they have to you know consider the customers that they're supplying right but it makes it very hard especially if a husband and wife work at Texas Instruments um-hum and one has vacation one time and one has vacation another time you know you're not in the same area right so you have to take a two week shut down and it's not at the same time so that isn't too nice uh this year they were going to try to do something different about that too they were going to try to schedule the whole site to go down at the same time oh boy to eliminate that and that you're talking about five thousand people yeah so that's quite a feat in itself yeah it is we've got um if i take half a day off during the summertime when the kids are out of school i can manage to be home in time to uh take care of the kids before the wife leaves she works uh oh i starts about eleven or twelve o'clock uh at the dentist office and works until seven thirty or eight that's just one late night to it to clean teeth as it were and uh-huh he had a hard time finding someone that was willing to work that that that seldom and in those hours and she didn't mind keeping her hand in the business while the kids were growing up as it were and she worked that day and then occasional Saturdays and uh with with the vacation time even if i takeoff the ten or twelve times a uh-huh a Thursday during the summer i still don't eat up all my vacation and end up taking a full week somewhere else and then having a day or two left over on top of that so oh that's great it's it's kind of nice to be able to do both and uh i'll probably be doing that for a few years now until the kids get old enough to stay by themselves yeah really that's excellent so yeah it's nice to have these little little benefits that i know wouldn't uh wouldn't happen in a real small company several of my friends have left uh the Metroplex is just full of little companies and they've left TI to go to a little company and and ended up you know even though they started with some vacation time uh it just did they had to schedule it around when they could get away and it just wasn't as convenient as being able to say well tomorrow i think i will you know yeah yeah and uh then they don't have quite the job security although you know now there's a lot of people getting cut but still but by and large the majority of people that are still there in even in the defense industry uh yeah if the job has got something you know something worth doing as far as the contract goes if there is a contract then you're probably pretty secure on that contract yeah and well they're doing a lot with um automation specialist also that's what i do uh where you have to go to school to or run the new automated automated equipment it's all computerized and and stuff um-hum um-hum and uh there's a lot of job security in that because it takes so long to uh come up to an experience level where you're able to you know you have to be able to maintain them do the maintenance uh right diagnose what's wrong with the machine and you know do whatever it takes to get it started again and things and interface with the technicians in the toolroom so you're kind of like your own boss as far as the machinery goes and um it's about a two year to three year experience before you're able to really um i would say payback right you know and and do the job well well that's good and you're still learning even after all that time because they're very complex machines yeah it's good that you can pick up something that adds to both your your security and your knowledge base exactly that's right you're getting two things at once there yeah well have and they offer uh a lot of uh opportunity to go to school um-hum that's another good uh benefit that TI has and they'll pay for ninety percent of your schooling with no commitment to them right right you know like a lot of companies will send you to school but you have to sign a paper that you'll work for them for five years or uh you know to that affect um-hum and you're kind of locked in so that if a career move comes up where you could take advantage of it you can't if you're you know signed in a contract um-hum whereas at TI they don't do that yeah i've i've looked at several uh courses as it were the only problem that we have is things that are that are specifically on our job uh that the courses that apply to our job other than the real basics like just the math and the physics and the like uh all of them are taught at colleges that are very remote in other words there like there's one in Washington DC and there's one in Oregon oh oh oh and they're they're just a few in the country that even have this type of training but just keeping up on the basics i guess are things that we could continue to do but um yeah well this part of the country there's no shortage shortage of uh good schools well we have we have lots of you know like MIT and and uh Boston's only uh an hours drive from here right so a lot of the the people can go you know to uh a good school um-hum and right in Rhode Island there are some nice colleges too Rhode Island college and we have lots of uh schools they just only only one in the entire area offers a course in what's called  i i assume i assume you have kids uh we have one she's only nine months old oh well she she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet right well my degree is in teaching so ah so i well we have a little bit of a basis for conversation i was a substitute teacher for about a year oh really yeah i uh thought i wanted to be a teacher so but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it um-hum and they uh in Alabama where i came from they they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided nope not for me did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels or yeah it was i just took grades one through six i thought i was going to be smart and get the good kids wrong um-hum well my degree was in fourth through seventh grade but i taught junior high and i expected it to be a lot of trouble but it wasn't that bad i taught remedial reading kids um and well they don't call it remedial reading these days they call it something else but but anyway at the time that's what i taught and um um yeah you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way hum hum when you have your slow readers but it it wasn't too bad we we got along real well well i i sometimes wonder if i didn't mess up i maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can if you have to you can get mean with them those little kids don't understand it yeah i especially with the real young ones i started out wanting to teach elementary lower like primary and then top primary and thought well no i don't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth grade and so that's what i got my certification in um-hum but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to if possible teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools yeah um and my reason for that was i don't like the uh what's the right word the varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools well that's a nice way of putting it you can find a lot of good public schools if you if you look real hard but i don't think they could cover everything that you could teach your children on an individual basis exactly exactly and two most people don't have that option yeah you know and plus it also depends on the district you're in as i mean on the i've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do um-hum uh accept for the private ones of course we're talking about public right i don't know back when i was going to school uh you just didn't get away with things these kids get away with now um-hum i mean you you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and usually bending over to get five of the best yeah um but now nowadays they can't even they can barely scold the children for something you you know without getting sued and the the um the crime is just escalated and the drugs and even in the the lower the lower schools oh yeah well the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class and uh this kid comes to school with his lunch box and inside this lunch box he's got easily two i'd say two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills um and i asked him uh what are you doing with that he says my father gave it to me and i didn't believe it for a minute um-hum um so uh but uh you know the not a lot i could do about it right can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants crazy for him to but well i have i i've fully i think i understood what the what the kid was doing he was a uh well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something um-hum yeah but not a lot i could do about it well we had the problem when i was in with teaching um i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with and if we did have a a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there um-hum and you don't know if you were reaching them or not but we felt like you know maybe just going ahead and try to teaching them was better trying to teach them was better than have them taken out yeah because uh that just that doesn't do a lot for them i mean it alleviates your problem but it doesn't do anything for them yeah right uh most the time if they were they were some of them were even better behaved i've only had two instances where i could it was really noticeable but they were better behaved when they were um i don't know if it was alcohol or something else that they were on but it ended up better uh i don't know guns and but i don't know that's something i think there's a problem too with teachers trying to um to be so versatile that they do lose sight of the basics you know they've been a big drive in especially in the seventies to return back to the basics um-hum and uh and i'm not completely just you know just teach the basics in schools but i think there does does need to be a reemphasis of those because of our our lowering grades in the standardized test and such oh yeah yeah oh sure i mean it's it's it's indicative across the board that we we've done something wrong but right and when you see uh Koreans and Chinese and Japanese who are taking all the uh science jobs all the engineering jobs all the mathematical jobs and you know here we are we can't we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator um-hum um i don't know well i spent a year and a half in Japan also and i've seen how their sc hool system works and i they go by a complete rote system you you just memorize everything um-hum and then at the end of the of a certain time period you spitted everything back out and the better uh memorizer you are the better your grades going to be yeah so i don't completely agree with that either no but there there definitely needs to be a balance somewhere yeah that's that's a great deal what law school's like oh is it yeah is that what you ended up going into um yeah oh and uh i just same sort of thing they just you you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases and then you get one exam for the whole semester um-hum and it's how well you can remember it all how how much you can stuff in your brain yeah and i found that a particularly useless way of studying yeah um i never did i always tried to understand things not tried to memorize um-hum and consequently some of the very best students were had excellent memories um-hum but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned yeah so uh it didn't show me anything a year and a half i gave it up yeah i wasn't really want i didn't want to be a lawyer anyway just wanted the degree um-hum yeah so yeah well well i don't know what can we do about it good good question probably taking money money is not the answer no there's plenty of money in the system it's just yeah i mean they're they're throwing more money at it now than ever before and things are getting worse i think it's uh like a lot of things in the in the the United States we've got so much built up in um in the state in the bureaucracy and in the politics of it and in the the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again and there's no way that that can be done um-hum um-hum um-hum not without wiping out a whole generation of of kids in the school system and so yeah yeah maybe on smaller smaller scales well i don't know i uh as much as i didn't like school when i was going through it from my perspective now i can see that it's a lot better than what we have now um-hum and i think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school yeah you know i mean it's it's silly that these that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline um-hum right into the classroom it needs to be yeah exactly i mean i be able to be enforced i i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something um-hum to students because they're going get they're going to get complaints or they're going to get sued or something it's like doctors in lawsuits you know they're kind of fearful of everything oh yeah well lawyers help create that that's that's true i've well at least i've heard that i i i haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's been applicable to me but but well i think i think i i mean what we've turned the schools into now are just day care centers um-hum you know somebody okay we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day and he's out of our hair right and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents um-hum you know they just oh yeah it has to be reinforced in the home oh sure i mean mean you you can you can have the best school system in the world if you don't get anything anything at home then it's it's not going to help either yeah right so i i don't know i don't know what the i don't know what the answer is um-hum it's an interesting interesting thing you want to do i how is Texas about keeping your children out of public schools do they allow it yeah they allow it under certain circumstances you have to to prove that you're teaching them something you have to follow um-hum a preferred curriculum um well they try to encourage you to to follow a specific curriculum although you don't have to um-hum and then if you have particular religious beliefs they have to be they're kind of monitored you know they they will allow you to i can't think of any examples but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence and maybe if they was a group of Mennonites or something like that i don't think they're is in in this area but um-hum um they they are monitored by the uh by the state school board hum so that's interesting i remembering reading a few cases about that when it when some people first tried that and they got sued um-hum got taken to court by the school system i'm glad the parents won i mean that's seems silly that uh i mean we started that's the that's the way you got your education in this country um-hum and then uh  i i like our benefits okay i'm pretty satisfied with them uh the only thing that i think i would change is the network the hospital networking i have Aetna Insurance um-hum you know the company insurance and and um-hum i would i just think i should would like to go to my own hospital where my doctor is rather than have to go to a hospital on a list that's the only thing i have against it well i i can see both sides of that issue and i think that uh it's just a necessary evil is basically what it comes down to what is that what is it because of because of expense is that the uh costs are just going out of sight and and uh you know it's either increase the premiums or try to uh everybody work together to try to curtail the cost that's the way i see it yeah do you do you use Aetna yes i do yeah you know it's pretty good they're really fast on paying uh all my claims you know i don't use it that much to be real honest with you i'm alone and and you know it's hard for me i don't go to the doctor unless i'm really sick and i don't get sick that much so you know sometimes i don't even come up with the deductible we've used it quite a bit in the past when our kids were smaller but uh in a year i don't use it that much either uh of course i'm using it right now i had a little skiing accident here in this last month and so i'm taking advantage of it right now you oh no are you did you break something yeah i cracked a collarbone separated the shoulder a little bit oh my God nothing too major oh did you are you on L O A no no i didn't even miss work just sling stick it in a sling and go on you didn't um oh my gosh well some guy killed himself today or yesterday in a skiing accident somebody up here he's head of oh welfare not welfare but probations or something on i can't think of what he's the head of uh he skied into a tree huh-uh and killed himself forty one years old um so i tell you getting back to the benefits okay i was just thinking about uh something uh uh kind of close to one of our guys in H R D their personnel and they uh he's been talking about this thing called flex benefits for quite a while and uh i think that's a interesting concept ever heard of that uh-huh uh be kind of like smorgasbord of benefits where you could uh tailor your benefit package to your own individual needs and so forth in other words if you were uh interested in having more vacation you could do that and then take cutback a little bit on some uh other area huh or uh you know increase your hospital benefits if you were in had a lot kids or something like that or yeah or in your case you might want to cut the hospital back a little bit and have more vacation yeah whatever i mean it's uh you know across the board huh i hadn't heard of that it's a yeah it's something they talked about for several years now i don't know if that he are getting any closer the problem is that some people might go a little bit overboard in picking out what they want and leave themselves too short in other areas i guess yeah yeah well uh i think TI has good benefits well in most cases i'd have to agree with you i think the uh profit sharing is a little uh think we have a little lacking right now oh yeah well and for the past few years yeah but like they always say you know got a good profit sharing plan just no profit but no profits right now i think when when we when we start showing profit which i hope we do pretty soon um that you know because at one time they had good profit sharing from what i understand i i didn't get in on it unfortunately um-hum yeah but well i've had a few good years but not too many in the fifteen i've been here see i've only been here four um so i'm just trying to hang on to my job yeah right yeah all these cutbacks and stuff this is pretty scary oh yeah yeah but but i really like working for their TI i think yeah it's a good company i don't know what division your in but we uh uh i hate to tell you i'm in payroll oh really but uh i i got a i got a bone to pick with the programmer on that new time program i love it you don't like it well i think it's a great concept but i think you've uh you've left too many uh uh i'm a supervisor and i approve i approve the uh the thing it it just doesn't make logical sense you know in other words it always keep jumping back up to the person you know where you enter your own number ID number huh the logical thing would have been had to go had it go to the the employee number so that's the one you're going to do the next action on the change you know and there's a lot of little things like that in there but it it could probably be corrected easily i don't know if anybody's griped about it or not oh we get gripes but all in all it it works pretty good for everybody you know yeah i think the concept's great you know and it and i'm sure there are some bugs in it and eventually maybe they'll work them out it it's been a tough year to get this all done and get everybody on it and um-hum i'll bet yeah it's uh but it's showing it's rewards now i think uh oh the stop pays and people coming off of L O A and everything people are really getting the hang of it now yeah yes boy in the beginning what division are you in fourteen oh fourteen well okay division one was worse because that's the biggest division and boy when we put them on oh my God the phone you'd hang up and it would ring it was just bad yeah but they've kept you hopping there yeah yeah but it's it's doing pretty well now i think everybody's oh yeah i think it's uh definitely got good definitely got a right idea see i don't have to go in and app rove time okay so i i really um-hum don't know what y'all are going through to be honest with you to sit there in option one and approve everybody's time i didn't do it before and i don't do it now so i don't have anything to compare that with for us in communicating with people with everybody um-hum and and being able to see what you are doing and everything it's really been a a a godsend it's been wonderful getting everybody on the same system it's been great and an easy system that everybody seems to be able to learn you know it's been really good yeah yeah um-hum yeah well that's that's one of the benefits that i uh that's a TI benefit new you know question well you know knowing a little bit about programming and a little bit about the time system and the way it was before and everything i just could see where he could made it so much better you know just by a few little more i don't know what you'd say attention to the to the right detail and stuff now i don't know who planned it all or how i don't even know how they came about uh agreeing on what all to do and with i know they're were programmers involved and i know the manager and the two managers and uh payroll were involved in supervisors and all but uh i came in last year out of one of the shops so uh it was all new to me i had to learn the old system and the new system that was fun hum that was fun and then after i had finally got it all down they said now forget the old system oh yeah sure thanks a lot so so for me the new system really was uh too bad was easier you know it really it really was is easier to work i think yeah so but that's just from my point of view like i said i don't have to sit down and depending depending on how many work rooms you have and everything you know it could be a real problem maybe to approve everybody well they made it uh extremely uh easy for the employee yeah i can just especially if it's standard week they can just don't even have to get in hardly to log on to it just to put the initial command and then their employee number and away it goes yeah yeah but you have to go in and and individually check everybody yeah working with it it's uh you can see some areas that could be improved yeah i think they must have worked on it because i've noticed one correction come through already it looks like they're several things that have uh changed already on it and now you're going to ask me what and i can't tell you offhand i just know we've had several changes it just man that's all right no i'm not the i only worry with it one time a week when i'm well twice really when i'm approving and then it's uh yeah yeah well i've had a chance to i had a chance to terminate and uh L O A and back to L O A that i think that was the most difficult thing for people to pick up on was stopping and starting people's pay mainly because you can do it now and it's easy and it's so easy that people go um-hum um-hum was that all i have to do it you know there's got to be something else i have to do and i'm no it's just really easy and setting up your own cost your own uh work groups now too where as we had to do it before yeah right just um-hum for you and now all you have to do is go in and put in a number and you got it you know so uh just put people in pick a number and put people in it and it's a work group so you know i think uh it's really a lot simpler than the old one yeah speaking of uh let's see big corporate benefits i wonder if uh i wonder if they looked uh have you ever heard of this administaff type thing this staff leasing that a lot of companies do hum-um they uh that's kind of uh new thing that come along and uh benefit well they uh what they do is uh well i guess it's basically for smaller companies that don't want to have all the payroll hassle and everything uh-huh you fire all your people and they uh they hire them then they lease them back to you and they do all the paperwork and provide the benefit of course they have  hi hi uh as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i uh took on a painting project in my bathroom and i had wallpaper up i had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that and it took me all weekend because uh the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down and that had to dry and then the spackling had to dry a day and then the painting took another day you didn't try we rewallpapering you just uh no i i just painted did you use a textured paint or uh no actually the wall behind the paper was smooth so i just used a like a semigloss um and well did you get good results well no not really i need to it it looks so bad you can see where those spackling marks were i need to uh either paper back over it or do something yeah but just didn't it didn't it didn't cover it yeah it covered the spots pretty good but it didn't excuse me it didn't uh uh it just didn't look as smooth as i wanted it to well we did a uh we moved oh last August and we're getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to i've forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said oh you can get by and i forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark uh-huh well more or less after about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable but it kept the the dark it was uh just a real dark uh wood grain type paneling uh-huh and uh it was smooth and uh and we would we put this stuff on and and it supposedly textured it or did something to it and but because of the the dark behind it was really hard to cover and was it like a primer yeah it was something like that although we sort of when we got through i wished we hadn't done it because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it and we were painting it and trying to do uh you know make it and it it really was you know the advice they give you is uh the job was considerably tougher than we thought yeah uh particularly when you try to i was talking to somebody else who who had a lot of wood paneling and uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot paneling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something oh my goodness that's an awful lot have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted not inside now uh when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it that was one of the requirements from you know FHA yeah that the house be painted before we bought it and it was fairly reasonable we have a brick house but all the trim yeah around the house was uh if i remember right it was like uh five hundred dollars oh that's quite reasonable yeah yeah so that wasn't too bad um the problem is have you have you tried matching paint lately no i haven't my wife we we built a shed over the long way actually it took this is not on the topic but i did finish it but my wife went to the uh Home Depot i think it was and and took a uh a copy took a piece of brick uh-huh and she wanted to paint the shed it's a it's a wooden shed uh and she took it and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint uh-huh and uh they got and uh and in fact she put some right back she got they mixed uh a gallon of it and uh it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint uh and it does it uh oh electronically some something magic oh so they did do a good job yeah you know they but it's electronic yeah uh you put your sample under this thing and it looks at it and and uh and determines the and it it's really remarkable uh the problem they had and then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim uh-huh and uh but they didn't didn't occur to them that um that they could have taken a sample uh-huh um from i forgotten this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something but anyway it's it's remarkable that's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the you know you want this you want this to look like this and you want that to look like that and of course if it's all white you're all right but when you start getting into colors have you had problems getting colors to match uh-huh yeah yeah as a matter of fact uh what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a uh a blue and the blue even so many years two years later or so it doesn't match um you know so it's the very same type of paint and everything gosh so so you so what's your what's the solution then oh i have no idea i repainted the whole thing oh my well at least you'll get very good at it right yeah you could go back and and paint the whole thing over that's uh this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting because it uh it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do i'll just do a little bit here and a little that yeah yeah although the uh it's uh it we almost one day we painted the house to uh we painted we painted the whole inside and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't the uh mold everything is white in a new house everything is white yeah that's right white yeah that's what we're trying to get ours to look like oh good luck we wound up selling the house actually i i don't know whether it made actually it does it's interesting that the white um yeah makes the rooms look bigger one of the in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames i don't know what you call that that actually that are along the walls you know up a couple of feet uh-huh uh-huh and my wife painted those the insides of those dark blue oh i see and uh it makes the room look remarkably smaller huh she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what color the trim is still white okay white the the molding but by and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive but it makes the room look smaller which is uh uh-huh yeah yeah uh which is it explains why they why they have everything white but i you wouldn't think that i well yeah yeah maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff but well uh what about the lighting did it make a big difference uh not particularly because the house has so many windows uh it has the the the living room has four uh good size windows oh uh-huh and uh well of course at night but with the we have we have we have a soccer field that's um oh about a hundred yards from our house uh-huh and the lights shine right at our house it's kind of we didn't know that when we bought the house but so that uh you get some the color doesn't really matter for because you have that light yeah we have a lot of light yeah and well it it it um well it's just uh i think it's just the the the dark blue to about three feet and then above that we left it white so anyway it didn't change but the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away it didn't it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic we're I see uh-huh we're really on to that that the masking is you have to do that very very carefully and it takes a long time that's right you can work yourself to death well i'm sorry to hear your color didn't come out so good over the weekend yeah really no kidding it's kind of frustrating it is a lot of work a lot of work well i've got to go to a meeting it's been good talking to you nice talking to you thanks a lot bye okay good-bye  i don't know i grew up uh in the the sixties and at that time uh it was is a changing time for the whole music scene i guess and i grew up with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it i guess for several years after i graduated from college and and thereafter but have since uh i grew up in a small town in in southern Oklahoma i have kind of gone back to uh more of a county uh flavor in music um i'm not quite sure why that is and it seems like almost a opposite but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pot uh sounding music it didn't have what you know guess what i was looking for at the time country tells more of a a story it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up and i've i've become i guess more of a country fan over the years when you say that you grew up uh in the sixties i take it that was the uh teenage type years or uh yeah that was my teenage years i was born in fifty and and uh okay we we're very similarly aged so we probably have an interesting interesting perspective on the music on the times so i'm just a couple years older than you uh essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that i for one reason or another i didn't pay much attention to music but as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me uh my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel whom i saw perform when i was in college and i became attached to that style of uh urban urban country if there is such a thing i think with in yeah a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because they do tend uh to have a dramatic or story approach to their music uh usually tend to have some sort of good or bad moral to it uh over time i became very interested in in baroque classical and i think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it it very relaxing for me my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat uh Simon yeah it's something that interests me uh combined with with the classical tastes i had mentioned and my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds early eighteen hundred music i'm not a music um i'm not particularly schooled in it i know what i like to listen to as far as classical music that's kind of the way i am and i i spent a good deal of time listening also to uh people from the late seventies really um Neil Diamond for instance Um people of of that particular time i listen to some country and western but i'm not school schooled in it and i i've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it i played a little bit of piano i continue to think that i want to do it and i never have the discipline to stay with it but when i do play uh and and begin to reacquire skills i inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a for a new piano player it is it's got uh basically an easy uh rhythm and and tone right and it's it's pretty fairly well easily to uh uh something to fall into i'm kind of the say way i i've gone through different periods of life uh in music from pop to classical i guess one of the things was that influenced me was that i i've worked in radio stations as a DJ for all my college years trying to support my way through there and support was support was uh influenced by all different kinds of music but basically because that's where i worked and i've developed a real love for uh classical music in probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was uh heavy into classical type music he said he used to sit on Saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music uh that they were using behind them because they used especially Disney used a lot of classical music uh behind the cartoons and so consequently we wind up wound up playing a lot of classical music there and i think that uh got deep seated into me one of things i especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is uh are those that call on those classical uh roots i guess uh Barry Manilow comes to mind for some reason there's there's not a whole lot of his stuff that i'm real crazy about but he does have some things Chicago had some things right uh and i think even Electric Light Orchestra had some some real um influences by classical music and i'm still still my favorite in fact most of my CDs that i got are classical music i find it very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy i particularly like the music i don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation uh a good example would be uh i have connections but but not particularly deep ones to the Vietnamese war type situations uh and i found that i really like China Beach and i particularly like Tour of Duty and both of them i had as much fascination of the background music i think going on as i did to the theme of the shows yeah uh and i i've uh Thirty Something i'm particularly interested but it's the music almost that i find myself listening to yeah i'm kind of thinking that's maybe our generation was uh so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with uh things now with the music that's behinds them that could well be i i uh spent my junior year uh and sophomore and junior year in in college when i a song by the uh uh i think the title of it was just Downtown uh and if you recall how it goes downtown da dah dah dah uh-huh right uh all i have to do is hear that song and i get you strongly evoked memories of of difficult times in school being behind on work uh and my family now knows if they come into my study and uh i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying to get a project done uh at school uh and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just stay away that's their signal they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it that's right yeah when did you first take your uh first piano lesson yeah uh probably about first grade yeah and i have uh returned about every four or five years to thinking that i would like to do something about it i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes and then inevitably i am swept away by the the pressure of other types of things uh yeah it is a time consumer it is in order to continue to to grow and i i always think that i'll be able to do it and then i inevitably discover that i have no innate music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other people take for granted yeah in composition themes and i keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times i bang on them i have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved right uh but in a in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude and i keep thinking gee i thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand but but it doesn't for me no it's making that that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it i was never able to to master all that in fact my brother and sister both they were oh thirteen sixteen years older than i they went through the uh parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing and when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again they sold the piano and is the turns out i was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to so i that's one of things i felt like i missed in life and i i really in fact uh uh-huh one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin that is played on uh piano i just you know i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that oh maybe one of these days i'll you know i'm kind of like you maybe one of these days i'll get around to it i'll do something with the piano but probably not so we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never g ot a chance uh just never got a chance to come out no that's the most fascinating thing well it's a pleasure talking with you and you sir you take care of luck in your graduate school okay good-bye good-bye  all right well what kind of uh restaurants what type restaurants you like to go to um casual ones but with class you know not too fancy but uh i i won't go to a fast food place uh-huh i really can't stand those uh yeah um do you like i mean what is it about uh the the kind of restaurants you go to that you like i mean what makes you like i said what makes you want come back um quality of the food is it well see uh qualities one thing but to me the uh not necessarily just the friendliness of the service but the service is real important yeah to me uh i will go back to a place where uh i smile during the meal you know and just not just because of the food but i mean because either the waiter or the waitresses yeah you had a good time there yeah exactly uh that's real important to me i i can't stand going to a stuffy place i mean it's just that's not me um in your you know like you said fast food restaurants aren't any good either yeah uh-huh but uh you know i don't necessarily uh you know there's a place here uh it's um it's good it's a barbecue place and it's uh you know you go through a line and and get your stuff okay but they make it fun you know they they they the people behind the counter are are laughing and joking with you all the time and i you know that's one reason why i like to go back um yeah yeah you know the food is excellent obviously that that is like i said that is important yeah but um you know if i don't know that i would go back as often if it wasn't for the idea that i have fun there yeah that's true there's some places though that i go to they don't have the best service or they're not the friendliest but i'll i'll tolerate it just because i know that's the kind of food i want to eat uh-huh and there's other places but like you said the the food doesn't matter it's you have such a good time there have you ever gone to like dinner theaters or or uh things like that yeah i have not in not in a good while but well see i'm uh i've been to dinner theaters but the every time i go it's you know on the nonmeal show type you know type thing so i've it's been a while since i've been to one uh just to see the show just to see the show right yeah yeah um normally its comedy i i enjoy comedy although there's one that i'm i'm really looking forward to going to in the next couple of weeks it's a i just found out that well i'm sure they've they've had them for a along time but it's uh uh-huh it's like a mystery uh theater uh that you you know you eat dinner and all through dinner they're they're doing this act and they they get supposedly get the audience involved in it and everything and that that sounds like that would be hilarious you know um um yeah that sounds pretty wild cause because i love watching mysteries on on TV anyway and i love figuring them out before they do you know yeah of course that's probably a lot easier on TV to figure it out than it is in other things because TV they have a tendency to do a lot of things uh that aren't you know what i mean um predictable exactly but i mean you know the the dinner a dinner theater like this ought to be just wild i don't know predictable yeah yeah that does sound like a pretty neat idea yeah so um i mean is there anything else about a restaurant that would make you go back though well there's this uh there's this type kind of restaurant called a brew pub are you familiar with those no hadn't heard of them where they they brew their own beer there oh yeah yeah and there's i used to live in Colorado and there was a lot of them there and there's actually there's two in the Raleigh area uh-huh and uh i'm a i'm a home brewer myself so i just am envious of these people and you go there and a couple you have gone to you can order like a sampler uh-huh and and while you're eating your meal and usually their food is good too they they bring out six different kinds of beer that they brewed on the premises and you just test it's like uh beer tasting thing while you're eating your meal and it's really neat um yeah that sounds kind of neat uh is location at all important to you like you know how far it is from your house or whatever um yeah i usually don't go somewhere that's too far away well yeah i i guess but uh yeah i i think my favorite restaurant is always been the one closest you know the closest as long as it's it meets the minimum criteria you know of good food yeah yeah well i guess for like lunch places that's really important because you usually that much time or or whatever um no kidding working for TI that's pretty important oh so that's why we're getting all these Dallas people that's what i figured but yeah yeah i didn't i don't want to assume that that's what i figured no i'm a college i'm a university student so uh so yeah that oh okay that also has a has a little bit of bearing on what restaurant choices you have when you're flat broke all the time oh yeah money does yeah i can see that so but uh i'm going to be starting working full time this summer so maybe maybe my restaurants will change so you graduating are graduating or yeah well maybe i don't know i'd uh i really haven't changed that much since i was in school in school um of course you know i'm not sure you ever get out of school to tell you the truth and uh yeah depending on what industry you get into or whatever like uh you know TI being electronics uh you never get out of school so you know um-hum no well actually i graduated with a BS in double E in in eighty eight and i've been in school ever since then i took one semester off and and i've been taking a class at least one class every semester yeah well like i said though my my change my taste in in food really hadn't changed all that much in in restaurants i mean a little bit yeah uh especially in you know i didn't have the money to go to these dinner theaters and stuff before uh-huh yeah right whereas i you know i have gone to a couple of these things before you know lately and you know it's like i said i missed the dinner dinner part of it but i've gone to the theater uh-huh yeah uh but i you know like i said that's that's probably so price really i guess does have a lot to do with it i hadn't even really considered that before um i've become a lot more health conscious and that's why i stopped eating fast food and places like that um yeah yeah well that's probably true to so i used to love hamburger joints and i don't go to them i don't eat hamburgers anymore but uh-huh well unfortunately i'm not as good about that as you are i still go every once one in awhile i used to just i i used be a connoisseur of hamburger places Mike's Grill that's the place to go for the best burger yeah well it's like i said you know the different there are different reasons for different things like that and you know hey you're right health is one thing that just yeah now i go for the best place to get uh tofu or whatever not quite that bad but uh i was wondering yeah well all right well i think that should just about do it yeah good talking to you we'll see you later bye-bye yeah take care uh-huh bye  um what kind of house do you live in uh we live in a one story just like a ranch style home you know the the standard Texas uh Fox and Jacobs oh yeah with with a yard and fence how about you guys are you in a house apartment or a house i'm in an apartment in uh Plano well they say that those are easy to find or difficult to find yeah they are if uh kind of depends on what you're looking for mine's just a one bedroom place that's uh how are rents doing i haven't looked at rents in a long time uh it's hard for me to tell because i haven't rented in uh probably twenty twenty five years uh-huh and uh just i'm getting back into apartment life and it's what's a what's a one bedroom are you in a um well Plano most most complexes in Plano are pretty nice so you're probably in a you know yeah but well they vary from from place to place it's hard to tell you know how well they've been kept up how old they are and these are probably oh one of the nicest that i found and uh um-hum they're almost five hundred a month for a one bedroom place ooh that does get high yeah i mean yeah it does considering that you know you uh house payments are not a whole lot more than that yeah i was going to say our mortgage is is between depending on you know it it drops um seems like in the last six months we um got lucky and we refinanced and it but it was like eight hundred and something but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty yeah so that's really not i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a townhouse in yeah in actually they're near Plano in North Dallas too but i couldn't believe it but you know wow that's a lot for a townhouse but that's what happens when you get up in this area you know you got all these companies are up here and these they i guess they know they're going to get it yeah and then i think that um nobody was really buying homes for a long time there because of just i mean we've been in ours for about ten years but uh there's no investment in it you know yeah all it allows you to do is itemize yeah that's true you just take off your mortgage interest and that's about it on your on your taxes yeah that's really about it it's uh have you ever owned your own home yeah oh yeah i've owned uh several and built several uh so you know what it's like yeah it's like when you first this is our third one it's not um and it's not that exciting after a while well well and especially around North Dallas or at least in Plano area they basically all look alike because Fox and Jacobs and yeah suburban track yeah we uh we lived out of state for a while and came back and uh we lived in a smaller city and now we say gee Dallas really is big and polluted isn't it i can remember i've only been here eight years but i can remember coming to work from i used to live in Wylie and i could see downtown Dallas uh-huh and now there's this brown haze over it and it's moving north yeah it's really it's really sad because they're they're not doing anything well we're getting off the subject i guess but just like with housing i mean they're not doing anything about pollution they're not doing anything about it's going to look like Houston have you ever been to Houston oh yeah you know um i used to think Dallas was better than Houston because their zoning for where you can put a house next to a now it looks just like Houston to me you know yeah yeah it does how how long have you been in this house we've been in here ten years ten years yeah so we've got you know we've got some investment in it but you really don't get anything out of it no you really don't were you said you were out of state for a while was that a smaller town than than Dallas area yeah smaller we were up in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania how were the how were the house prices up there my home town um the prices actually a lot better because Pittsburgh is about the size i'm trying to think like a Louisville or Minneapolis that type of size yeah and the prices what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventy five eighty wow yeah it's really and we didn't think it was that clean but then after you're gone for a while it looks cleaner you know hum oh yeah um well you know a lot of these people that i've talked to that are coming down from uh like what i call the back East especially from JC Penney yeah Saint Louis whatever uh are selling two and three hundred thousand dollar houses up there and buying a hundred and fifty hundred and seventy five thousand dollar houses down here and they've wind up getting better houses here than they had there really so in a way i guess it works both ways you know i guess it's yeah but and here i guess it depends on what you want you know here once people like i know a lot of people that work for JC Penney in marketing yeah and a lot of the people that came from that area probably like what you're talking about they had no um they had a lot of property but not a lot of house and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it that's a fact but but they love it i mean they they they think that they're getting you know you say um sun room to them and you enclose and you can sell i guess that's true and they don't have to worry about yard upkeep because they don't hardly have any yeah yeah and a lot of them i know a couple women that work there and they don't miss in public relations and they don't miss having a basement to run up and down to you know that's true there's not too many basements in Texas and i said you haven't heard about tornados how about bugs you know yeah gosh i remember when i was little uh we didn't have a i lived grew up in southern Oklahoma and uh people across the street had a cellar and we we never did uh-huh and it's just like Dallas area it was tornado alley up there and every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street and we'd go into the cellar and i yep to this day i don't care if i go or not you know if it's going to get me it's get me that's exactly uh growing i grew up in western Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh and uh we used to call the basements actual cellars so it's funny to hear that word because i never hear it you know it's like the back porch used to be a stoop you know yeah yeah but uh um the housing is just we like the older homes and i don't know if we're going to stay here or not depends you know i mean you ever thought about building a house pardon me you ever thought about building a house yeah actually when we were up north um but some family things changed so we ended up coming back down here and all that because it helped my husband's work but um we really would like to but we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here you know it yeah that's true especially well well TI is like anybody else you never know how long you're going to be here or be in one place you know yeah it it's real tough i mean the economy any more i mean i think everybody just lives under an umbrella the uncertainty with housing and everything you know it's um pardon me yeah do you work do you work yes i do so how do you handle do you got any kids uh no we don't so you got he's working and you're working and you got this big house to take care of how do you manage both of those uh how do i take care of the house well i don't have a Mexican i don't i shouldn't say that i don't have an ethnic maid i don't have we have some friends that live near North Dallas off of Campbell Road and they have like a four thousand square foot home and she's got a uh yeah a live out nanny um but any rate i don't have any of that um i don't know it's really not too difficult with no children and just two people you know you basically can take care of everything yourself we have a yeah we have a dog and we're pretty i mean we're not fanatically neat but um we keep things up you know it's not like where there's three feet of weeds or anything in the yard by the time you need to um get around to fertilizing and cutting in the spring yeah yeah what about home repairs and stuff do you have to do all that yourself or um no we're pretty much um we we've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wallpaper together wow you too and things like that um we pretty much hire we subcontract mostly everything i mean other than anything that's not a um i mean i know how to fix a running toilet yeah yeah oh yeah he does what he needs to but mostly if it's something major um you know cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that we just hire out to do that yeah sounds like you you've already got the makings for being a general contractor yeah no thanks i yeah if you don't wall paper it well together you should probably not build a house together have you ever done that i mean you sound like you may have been a couple one time yeah i built three houses in my life and and how'd that go oh they the the building process was a lot of fun but puts a lot of strain on things uh-huh getting to agree to things that i'm sure and i also think that once you get to be um you know certain when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older yeah you start um the dollar value on things you bet i you know i think people that own homes a lot in North Dallas are very materialistic oh you bet i know i'm supposed to talk about homes but people that own the people that own them are the home homes themselves and you know um spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies for custom drapes just doesn't oh yeah well to some of them i guess it doesn't matter you know that maybe they've got enough coming in to to take care of it but yeah that's i mean and and you know you see a lot of these people that came east from uh west from uh from New York with Exxon or JC Penney and it's just a hoot to watch them hum um-hum oh yeah they as far as they're concerned they've come to the promised land you know they've got it made already right right exactly so well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house oh yeah because you're combine uh confined by space you know i had a i came out of a thirty one hundred square foot two story house house and i had room for everything oh my goodness yeah in fact i had more room than i knew what to do with i don't know it's it's seems like room uh stuff always expands to fill available available space but uh-huh yeah uh well in a way you can travel light yeah you can yeah you know you learn you adjust you figure out how is how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that it's not as bad as i thought it was uh-huh uh it's not as bad as i remembered especially going to college and living in apartments there you know how noisy that can be yes i do uh there seems to be a a more a mature crowd in uh apartments at least where i am uh even though you know there's kids all around and there's there's traffic and there's people going up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that but still uh everybody pretty much keep keeps keeps to their own turf so to speak yeah pretty much and uh there's never really any any oh i remember in school there's just seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night you don't run into that up here i think i think because there's so many uh professional people if you want to call them that yeah uh-huh uh that go spend all day at work and they want to come home and they want some quiet yeah relax and try to go to sleep really yeah yeah yeah you see a lot of activity outside people riding bikes or playing ball or jogging or doing this and that and uh they're trying to to unwind and i think Plano in general is getting a little more well it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right oh yeah it's a hundred and what eighty thousand something like that isn't that something yeah the price of home now we paid oh we paid um about seventy eight nine for our house like i said about a decade ago not even about nine years ago and yeah i'd say they appraised it it's gone up you now maybe like five percent oh yeah so it's an investment but it's something that you know when you're first married or starting out you think if you really have something but you really it's just real nowadays with the way income tax i think housing is strictly to itemize oh you bet and the thing that that gets me is uh you never really catch up you never really finish doing things and uh yeah exactly we you're always paying for something you know yeah and even you know i mean like we had i called them prefabs just a track home you know i mean we we had one of their homes that was nicer in Pennsylvania but um it was an older home but then you buy an older home and you're always fixing things up um-hum oh you are constantly there's always something going wrong so you know  how did you first get involved in camping oh i guess uh it's hard tell i guess probably i didn't do much as a kid because we grew up on a farm and my whole life was camping uh but uh yeah later on uh later on i think when my oldest daughter got involved she and i got involved in Indian Princesses we used to go up at Possum Kingdom and do a lot of camping at Possum Kingdom uh-huh are you a native Texan no no i'm i'm New England Massachusetts oh okay i guess i grew up uh camping my folks were big campers from day one as far as i can remember we grew up in southern Oklahoma and they were uh we were always hit Texoma or oh okay some camping area all of either Texas or Oklahoma uh-huh and i was involved in Boy Scouts as a young kid and we were camping uh seem like every other weekend we would go somewhere i when they talk about the definitions of camping it kind of struck me as funny my brother and sister-in-law who live in Arlington and go camping uh a lot during the spring and summer and fall but their idea of camping is a little bit different than mine they have a fifth wheel trailer that they pull that has you know two bedrooms a TV and microwave and stove and all that kind of stuff and he pulls it with a big pickup yeah that when i when i when i go camping i usually take a sleeping bag and some cooking stuff and that's about it yeah that's they yeah kind of cheating isn't it well it's not like leaving home when you take it with you the whole idea is to get away from it no hum yeah oh sure speaking of uh southern Oklahoma uh you go up into the Arbuckle Mountains at all camping up in there i have been and uh some of the boy scouts have been up in there they have got some great hiking trails and camping areas up in there yeah we went up to uh i talking about being an Indian Princesses i was actually in it seven years with two daughters four with one three with the other and with my second daughter we camped up at Camp Classen one time um-hum i'm not familiar with that one and uh well it's right uh you know i'm trying to think where it is it's not too far over the border and it's up in the middle of the Arbuckles and it's near Turner Falls yeah oh yeah and uh uh that is just absolutely when you consider how flat everything is here that absolutely beautiful company to uh country to camp in boy that's a fact yeah well a lot of my camping was up in the Arbuckles as i was growing up there's a place that used to be called Platte National Park up around Sulphur and Davis and and not too far from Turner Falls uh-huh yeah they have i have heard they since changed name of the park to something else but it was one of those parks with uh a natural uh spring fed river that flows through the camp sites you know all along the river the water was real cold because it was spring fed but just like i say it's a beautiful area lots of hills to go camping in yeah uh dad never believed in tent camping uh we had some old army cots that we would sleep on uh come good weather or not a many of times we were sleeping out under the stars and it would start raining and we would all wind up in the car and that got pretty cramped sometimes a lot of good memories in in in camping you know it helps you unwind and get away and forget about TI and everything else back home i guess uh-huh oh yeah uh another thing how about uh have you been to the Texans Texoma side no i haven't i've never been up there oh for goodness sakes that is that is just really nice we kind of you know i've been at TI thirty two years and in my young single days i used to camp there a lot then i sort of forgot about it for twenty years and uh yeah uh two years ago my children started asking they say picture of it over at Texans and we started going there again we sort of rediscovered it well that that's true i've never thought i've heard about it countless times but never thought about going up there yeah and uh it got a lot a lot of campsites you know there's uh uh concrete pads that you can put tents on there's places to pull in RVs and plug them in up uh there's even two and what we we used yeah they have got two log cabin shelters that are basically uh four walls and a roof log cabins with a concrete floor and a picnic table in them and a ceiling fan and screened uh windows well so you can kind of go in there and just bring your sleeping bag well that would be great there pretty cold and sleeping bags and air mattresses you can camp on the floor you got a roof over your head shoot let come what may yeah let come what may and they're fairly close to the water aren't they i mean they're right on the late yeah they're very close to the water within like uh a hundred yards they they got a place where you uh can keep your boat while you're there for the weekend yeah yeah they've got a place where you can keep your boat you can they've got the dock that you can tie up tie up and it it's uh it's in a protected area yeah so and i i've got a son that really started going about seventeen he's seventeen now he was he was fifteen then but uh i've got a son son and both daughters like to go and uh they have got a a dock down in the protected area yeah where the fishing pretty good and uh oh yeah you know we'll we'll leave him down there at ten o'clock with his fishing pole and sometimes go after him if a big storm comes up yeah so it's time to quit but you know he can walk back to the little cabin in about five minutes from there but it's it's a ninety nine acre i think it's a ninety nine acre in fact they have acquired some more now that they are going they're going to clear but it's a long term lease from the corps of engineers that's great i'd forgotten all about the Texan side and that's but you got to be a member of Texans to use it yeah yeah you you've got to be a a Texas member but if you are a master member of Texans the membership to Texoma is free yeah oh that's outstanding uh you can you can get a family membership do you your family camp at all you you camp with your family how how what oh yeah i've got a boy that is uh thirteen and the girl is eleven the boy had learned to uh ski oh probably two years ago he's a slalom skier now and the girl's eleven and she just now started to learn to ski oh boy yeah what kind of a boat do you have i've got a sixteen and a half foot Bayliner it's inboard outboard just a ski boat it's about the right size for us uh-huh yeah when i was yeah in my young in my young single days i had a uh Turbocraft are you familiar with that yeah i know them yeah i had a uh a uh sixteen foot hundred and nine horse power cylinder one and i i had that for two or three years and then i traded it for a eighteen foot uh two hundred and twenty horsepower V eight you bet goodness and uh oh that thing eat gasoline uh we could suck up thirty gallons in an afternoon of skiing yeah i expect it would yeah but boy it would move you across the water though yeah it will move you across the water and it would pull three slalom skiers without batting an eyelash that's what you want plus out on Texoma you have got all that you know mass of water to get across yeah yeah p lus it it planed in about two inches of water so you never dragged on anything because there was was nothing under it but unfortunately what i did was and i i guess what what happened when i was single i had it outstanding and my wife and i skied a lot when we first got married and the children came along when they're real little they can't really participate and i guess i was paying more on insurance and maintenance than i was getting out of it and i sold it uh-huh you're right and never had a chance really to get back to boating again absolutely that's what happened to us we had a boat for several years in early marriage and along came the kids and it kind of sat there yeah yeah so we wound up selling it and it's been about uh i'd say eleven years uh since we got back into boating now they are big enough to yeah you rediscover rediscover you rediscover it when the kids get old enough to do it yeah you bet plus they can help now too they don't go along for the ride yeah yeah right where do you well i guess that's our uh five minutes uh so we'll yeah call this thing to a halt i appreciate talking to you Bill oh okay okay i just i can i just let me ask you one more question where do you ski sure uh well i had only had the boat two years now uh most of the time we either go out to Lavon or uh we have been going up to Arkansas uh she her parents live up on Beaver Lake in northwest Arkansas real good it's uh uh-huh um-hum dammed up the uh White River real pretty in Arkansas lake but we are hoping to explore a lot of the lakes around Texas and just stay close to home yeah yeah i'll tell you i i would recommend too Texoma is nice because there is no many places you can ski there oh right yeah and uh in the Texans area has two nice launching ramps yeah one of them is in a protected cove and the other one is okay if the lake is calm it's out more in the open uh the other place that i would really strongly recommend is Possum Kingdom yeah well i have heard a lot about Possum Kingdom and that is absolutely the prettiest that when i learned to slalom ski it was the only place i didn't mind swallowing and boy i swallowed a lot a lot of water learning and the only place i didn't mind swallowing half the lake and i didn't feel grungy about it like i did at Lavon oh yeah it's not over crowded ah no it's not over crowded it's uh it it far enough away so it's not over crowded and it's surrounded by cliffs so no matter how much wind it is there is always a big portion of the lake that's calm yeah see that's one of my biggest gripes about Texoma as many times as we would go up there it's it's so rough yeah its too open yeah and there's uh they have got some forty to fifty foot high cliffs around Possum Kingdom and you just get up and ski uh adjacent to those and uh and it doesn't make any difference how windy it is you don't notice it that sounds oh no well that sounds like a good place to start out this spring i am looking forward to it yeah oh okay well you ready to wind up hey nice talking to you my friend yeah good night bye-bye all right thanks a lot Bill nice talking to you good bye  so well you're you're you're you you take this subject much more personally than i do i suppose i suppose i do because i've seen a lot of those changes the the changes that women have had in the last generation well you know not even the last generation the last fifteen years twenty years going from well uh-huh take it back thirty years i'm going back too far from my parents' generation when mom stayed home yeah period and and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job until well unless if you were educated you got you know you might teach for a year or two before you got married yeah and if you really pushed it you taught until you had kids or something you know if you had if you were a teacher then you know that was it yeah until the kids you were little yeah you you weren't supposed to want a job yes there was not there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that you might have for anything other than your house and your children and how clean can the the bathroom floors be on any given day um-hum yeah and then and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way you're supposed to only want the job and and uh your kids should be totally happy in day care because everybody else goes to day care and and we have these wonderful people who are yeah um-hum who are totally prepared to teach to teach your child everything they need to know in day care and yeah but but and uh we'll see how the generations go huh but uh a really good day care is probably going to cost more than you're going to make at the job yeah i at least for a lot of women depending on on what she did i've i was an engineer with uh yeah mechanical engineer with T I and uh i did it for six years and for one well i had one while i was pregnant and then one while my oldest was a year old and and it just drove me crazy did you i could not do either well enough i couldn't put in enough overtime that was necessary or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays um-hum as is you know as is needed and because my husband had had for a long time was out of the country oh yeah also with uh with work for like three months and and so it was you and the kid and your work schedule is well that's the thing see you know maybe if you get along for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer you know the technicians work the eight to five job and and know when they're going to be there yeah yeah it might have been better yeah but uh if you're going to be more professional professional oriented then you've got to have this to be able to perform well on the job you've got to have the flexibility that that doesn't really go with the family yeah and so it was in my case i i just uh decided that as long as my kids were little i would be better off at home with them instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once um-hum so you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer is that what you think well actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an engineer i'm i'm i'm a photographer now oh yeah oh okay you've found something else i have i have branched out i was a photographer before but when i went to college it was i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer um-hum yeah that it would just have to be a hobby and i'm i'm very mechanical and mechanical engineering interested me so i did that and then i you know i did that for six years and then i stayed home with my son and did nothing and found out that i was that you know it was great but i was bored part of the time too and i wanted something else yeah yeah i mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child to do yeah and it's it's great while they're really little but as they get older um-hum and they're more independent and there's things to do then it's good for them to go to different i mean it he goes to a a mother's day out program now once a week both of my kids do yeah um-hum and so they're getting they they get the socialization with other kids and you you know and not really school but but a different authority than mom once in a while you know and kind of learning how to deal with society yeah and and they they need that you know to be able to relate to other people besides yeah i think they do too the same person every day and i need it for the break so yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and um-hum and enjoy it that's that's the whole thing and if it's not if it's not mom then then dad or somebody's got to move in there and do the job because the kids really need it yeah yeah i think that's the thing that were going to see well i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next ten years even in the even now they're starting to do it but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years is that there's going to be a lot of women and they're going to have to work it out to working part time um-hum because if if i if i had been allowed to work you know maybe thirty hours a week instead of fifty hours a week i might still be working basically full time or part time if there was if there had been some way to work it out because i liked my job really well but i was just pulled in so many different directions i was it was just driving me crazy yeah um-hum and now with the photography that's you know it's working that's what i'm doing is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the uh week and and use those hours to do the the thing that i'm doing is taking school pictures yeah uh-huh in day cares and in mother's day out programs and also soccer teams and you know different stuff like that so my kids yeah um-hum can be in day care for a few hours a week or my husband if it's you know and and when he's at home can take care of them yeah so jobs have to i guess become more flexible i think they're really going to have to and not and not just for mothers for fathers as well um-hum yeah it's going to have to be both well so so that's another thing that has to adapt is you know the the the father's attitudes about you know whose whose job is this yeah well it's it's his job too and i to me the only important issue is the children because as far as housework goes you know men can do housework just as easily as women and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to so uh you know it's just convincing your husband that's important or that that that it's important enough for him to do it because if he saw mom to me yeah to yeah to me yeah well doing only that you know all the time he was growing up then it's hard to think of it um-hum yeah in that other you know uh that i should do it or that or just to think about doing it rat her than having someone tell him to do it i know that was a big thing in our house for a long time was that if i wanted my husband to do something to help and you you you yeah you talk yeah yeah um-hum and even though we were both working the same number of hours and and doing things i had to come in there specifically and say this needs to be done this is what you do it now no yeah and and a man might say out loud well you know i understand this and i agree but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him and and that's a very hard attitude to change yes and yeah and without and and it's just they don't look at things most men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it um-hum they just you know just kind of scoot it on another spot on the on the sink and and put the next plate down and and in a while get around to it and i think most women walk in and and and with oh got to clean all this up got to get this out and this in and this you know taken care of instead of having someone say now this needs to be done this is the time this needs to be done but hm uh um-hum yeah and a lot of that is is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid which brings us back to the idea you know someone's got to be there taking care of the kids to drill in these you know drill in the right ideas that's right yeah um-hum yeah to so that they know that uh you know male and female are both responsible for doing this and um-hum and uh and i think that's that's going to show up a lot more now in the in the next generation of of boys and girls it's not they're not going to the boys in this next generation are not going to have to be told as much uh-huh um-hum this needs to be done because mom was there saying that dad is there you know you both got to they were both working at whatever things were yeah yeah needed to be done they're going to say to the kids you need do this because it needs to be done not because it's a woman's job or a man's job but because it's dirty and it needs to be cleaned um-hum yeah um-hum yeah but i think in between we got a a group of kids a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap and so basically no one was taking the responsibility and i i think that's happened in a lot of cases and it's gonna it's gonna yeah some kids are really having it If they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't yeah the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases young college yeah um-hum um you know some time day care is really good but sometimes it's just it's baby sitting it's someone you know keeping an eye on the kids but the kids are basically doing what they want and not really having any yeah yeah yeah relationship with the adults to say you know here's what's right and here's what's wrong and and here's what we expect of you yeah i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit was because i wanted my kids to have my values and i felt like when they were young that was the time to instill it that it could be it could be added to and strengthened as they grew older but when they were little yeah you know this is the way i feel about this and this is the way because i it's you know when you when you if you if you teach them when they're little the way you want them to be and the things that are important to you then you just you add onto it as they get older um-hum but if no one does anything when they're little then it's twice as hard as i think as they get older yeah i'm i'm saying this as i'm trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something yes i understand i i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls yeah well she's usually in bed by this time but she's staying up late tonight but yeah you know i want to i want to have a relationship with her you know my my dad was a very traditional dad and when i was a child i didn't really know my dad very well and i miss that yeah that's the thing if woman's role like we said if women's roles change drastically men's roles will too and a lot of it's for the better some of the some of the women's roles i think are almost for the worse because we're losing out on some things going back to work and i want yeah the men have to be convinced of that but i think if we can if we can expand the men's roles at the same time like your taking care of your child and your dad probably didn't very often i know i know mine almost never did no  okay we're supposed to talk about what the weather's been like let's see uh it's been pretty windy yeah it's been windy the past few weeks i've noticed that yeah so far has been hasn't been too much rain which is really nice because last week all that rain and it was just bad with all the flooding when uh Trinity Mills Road flooded over all those times you couldn't i couldn't pass by it yeah oh yeah oh really well i i didn't have to go down there but uh uh driving on the freeway was uh made it difficult because everybody couldn't get off and they'd get off somewhere else uh-huh right well you know they said that we haven't had enough rain though and that surprises me because it seems like we've had a lot of rain this year but since we've uh last i heard that we hadn't met our you know hadn't got up to the right level yet that we yeah the current average or whatever right well it truly surprises me because it seems like we seems like we do get a lot of rain but i guess not i guess it doesn't accumulate too much but um i'm glad it's summer yeah finally i like the warm weather me too and the winter wasn't that bad i was really grateful that it didn't get that bad this winter yeah i'm not uh fan of cold weather i've lived up in in the northern part of the country and i never did like the cold weather that much i don't either i want some you know ski or something you know i'm benefiting from it yeah yeah i guess in a way i just i really like the summer like to uh be able to lay out or you know just be outside yeah i don't mind the heat that much it doesn't bother me that much cold weather i just i don't know i just can't tolerate too much with the yeah i know it seems like you can never get warm enough to yeah so i like Texas it's a nice place to be i do too and so i guess it's probably the same over where you're at in Garland as opposed to Lewisville yeah yeah i would think i don't know might be a little bit different because the city interferes with the weather patterns to a certain extent because of the heating of the of the concrete and asphalt true that's true that's true it does seem to uh that's why they say always say it's like five degrees warmer in the city at night time than out in the country uh-huh uh-huh i do like um like an old uh warm summer the breezes that it gets at night you know you can open your windows and yeah oh and it gets those nice warm breezes coming in that's nice yeah and that helps on utilities of course who can't use that yeah and that's especially in Garland it's real bad yeah especially in Texas period yeah yeah well we didn't have much we had some good ice but not a lot thank goodness not well have you lived in Texas all your life yeah sure have how about you no uh this is this is the fifth state i've lived in are you serious yeah so i've just been all over the country and uh some places had really cold weather when i was living in Indiana it got really cold ugh i mean one day it was like sixty below zero are you serious and uh uh they said you know stay inside um in fact last year i was driving home one night and i was listening to some station some radio station in Iowa and uh the uh DJ was saying uh tonight's going to be like eighty below gosh and he said uh this is serious folks this is serious business stay inside do not go outside at any for any reason boy that's horrible and i thought yeah no kidding ooh i hate that that's horrible that of course that was last year when we had the real bad freeze you know in the country and this last winter wasn't wasn't that bad as as i remember it right know well that's true well a friend of mine went home this weekend uh he lives up in the uh Pan Handle uh-huh and um he went home for Easter and it snowed up there and then the next day it was up to seventy five is that right yeah that would be horrible i wouldn't like that well you just can't depend on it schizophrenic weather yeah yeah it's just real comfortable here where we live and that's the way i like it i like being able to depend on a hot summer and yeah you know it does it gets cold enough in the winter to where you you realize it yeah and you can do your fires and everything and then move on yeah when i lived in California they had uh what i describe as boring weather it was the same virtually year-round which what i thought was great you didn't have to worry about tornadoes you didn't have to worry about uh too cold or too hot it was just nice and even and i liked that it was it was nice yeah right yeah yeah but uh i don't mind the heat i don't either i don't i don't miss the cold at all but i don't mind the heat yeah yeah i wouldn't mind some you know like i guess after awhile in the summer when it hits i guess about October and you get a few cool days i don't mind that because it kind of gives you some relief yeah that's right it's kind of nice too to have that fall you know that's nice yeah spring and fall are nice times of the year yeah they really are spring because we're getting that getting rid of winter finally yeah and all the trees and plants are coming out thank goodness and grass yeah yeah for a change i i got i get sick of winter just looking everything so dead i hate that yeah no kidding so that's uh kind of depressing to see all that yeah yeah it really is it's just an old gray looking sky and it's boring yeah really i guess it wouldn't be bad if you i guess up north it wouldn't be bad to visit we we love to go skiing and um snow it's beautiful when it snows and you have all those pine trees and everything that is pr etty but i sure couldn't live there yeah yeah it's something you have to get used to i guess i mean i lived with that for a while and yeah you just adapt i guess so to a certain extent here in the summer time we go back and forth between air-conditioned buildings there you go back and forth between warmed up areas i mean uh warm i guess so i remember when i was living in Indiana i was uh uh going going to school there and i used to ride my bike across campus and one day it was it must've been close to ten degrees above zero and um God and i thought well if i ride my bike the wind chill will be close to zero it will last seven minutes six minutes if i walk it'll be ten degrees warmer but it will last twenty minutes um um-hum that's right which do i want you know it's colder for a shorter time or a little bit warmer for a for a longer time and so i took the shorter colder option yeah hum right right i don't blame you i would too and i got down to where i uh to to the building i was going to and my face was about frozen off and i thought was that such a good choice i weren't quite so sure at that point i do hate that feeling though it oh yeah frostbites yeah yeah my fingers always get get it real bad i hate that i mean i bundle them up and everything and and i still get it yeah i guess i can bare the cold it's just when it does the wind hits oh yeah oh that just feels like it goes all the way to the bone it does you can feel all the way through it's like a knife like a sword like a sword a sword slicing in half or whatever yeah it hurts exactly hurts i hate it yeah oh well i don't know what else i can say about it well me either it's kind of a boring topic i guess well i guess that's all i to say you too all right then i'm through you too bye-bye have a good evening bye  well how about you do you use PCs oh constantly you and i both it seems like uh everything i do has is computer related uh-huh and if it goes down then we're stuck all day yeah and so i like the IBM PC personally uh-huh but that's pretty much everything i've worked with and uh i've become so accustomed to it that uh it's like second nature yeah what do you use well i have an i IBM PS two model thirty yes uh-huh and uh it's kind of kind of getting too slow for me but my job i'm an EDP auditor so i audit uh computer applications both on the PC and the mainframe level oh uh-huh and i use my PC constantly not only do i do PC type things like uh using lotus or word processors huh-uh i also use my PC to emulate a mainframe terminal for our IBM mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine uh-huh oh okay so all i have on my desk is my PC but i'm i'm getting not only our local area network but i'm getting two separate mainframe machines also oh okay oh we um we use it's an IBM PS two also huh-uh and um you know every now and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than i'd like huh-uh uh but uh uh i we i do mainly um graphics on it huh-uh and uh a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it yeah and uh uh you know i don't know i just i enjoy working with them yeah there's just there's so many capabilities out there i mean the things you can do are endless yeah i've become kind of the PC guru in our audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground uh-huh and there's three of us EDP auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so she's not real proficient in PCs and the other just hasn't used PCs that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing and i'm the administrator for our local area network and i need to keep that going and uh-huh so i i'm i couldn't live my life without a PC i don't have one at home which which we have one at home but i just don't find the time that i can use it yeah i would right now i would rather not have one at home because i would work at home i yes uh um we've got a couple of portable lap top PCs at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot uh-huh to do work if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night oh the one of the reasons why i got mine was before i went on maternity leave they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because i am pretty much the like you said the guru in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is yeah uh-huh and um so they didn't know how it was going to work they're thinking that we were going to have to get a modem so that we could you know uh and a decks machine so that we could in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so yeah but uh you know it's uh they're they're really great uh it's almost like we could we could become too dependent on them yeah and oh i the uh we use a lot of free lance and uh uh-huh that's uh pretty much takes up a lot of our day as far as producing transparencies and things yeah and um it uh you know compared to the way the things have upgraded have uh really what's the word i'm looking for i'm just totally drawing a blank but uh the way things have changed over the years with the PC and the different programs is just great it's remarkable the things we can do now and compared to you know back a few years yeah just the power i'm i'm trying to uh get an upgraded machine mine is uh just putting along and it's not fast enough for me so i want to get a new uh four eighty six chip but uh i don't know yeah i don't know if my boss will spring for it but i'm i'm i'm i determined to brake mine so he has to get me another one we think about that a lot yeah well that's what i do we had a printer a a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer uh-huh and we had about ten people sharing this printer by it was attached to like a central PC and you had to take your diskette to the PC to print something oh um now that's awful so the first thing when i started working at this bank is i said well now first of all we need to all be able to share this PC without getting up so i talked my boss into investing in a it's not a uh a uh real elaborate local area network but we can share the printer huh-uh and we can uh send files to each other and we can mail send mail messages to each other which is what which is good enough it's what we need uh-huh oh okay um-hum right and then i talked them into buying a HP Laser Jet oh yes and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it but once he bought it he has been so pleased it's it's fast it's quite oh it has good copy right the quality that you can out off with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers yeah i've got a little little uh IBM Pro Printer on my desk but and i can use either the Pro Printer or i've got my PC configured to where i can use either printer the one that's on the network or my own yeah uh-huh so if i just need something real quick and i don't feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed i can just print it in my office um uh we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer yeah and uh it's just so you you know with budget restraints and things like that it's makes it difficult they have gotten really cheap Hewlett Packard makes it's it's actually a dot matrix printer and uh uh-huh but the quality is almost uh laser quality oh uh-huh and i think it's called the desk jet yeah and they're under i think they're uh about eight hundred dollars now and we uh got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred oh uh yeah i don't remember what kind they were uh but uh we uh do a lot of transparencies huh-uh sometimes the color would take too long to plot uh plot out yeah so they just want black and white ones and see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick yeah because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it yeah but uh it uh i mean that's all you need for like for like bullet charts and stuff you don't need them in four colors uh-huh no uh-huh if it was a customer presentation then that would be different we would want to razzle-dazzle a bit but uh yeah it's uh yeah we have one in the office and if we want to use it well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to change it put it on a disc and carry it over to there and see if they're not using the printer you use the sneaker net system right and uh wait for an opportunity to use it yeah yeah we you'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer uh-huh until they got off the machine i know i know i understand that was uh i was amazed when i came to work i worked at the uh well it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came up and bought the rival and now N C N B and now N C N B's got a little larger market share uh-huh but it's the only uh well it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas it's the only one that's still alive oh uh-huh so any way i work in a big prestigious place right and i couldn't believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this this huge holding company sharing a HP Rugged Writer i was going oh wait a minute come on guys this is crummy right so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the times in technology here yeah yeah we're we're pushing real hard though we're we're trying well see the entire bank is not like that we the the bank philosophy is one of innovation innovation and lead the market uh-huh it's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the uh the senior vice president over audits is cheap uh-huh and it's real hard to pry money out of him to to to do these things but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and right we we find it hard to believe sometimes or hard to understand when uh so we work for a computer company and uh how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated and when it's obsolete yeah and the guys that that some of the guys that run this place are very tight and it's like well why do we need this can't you do that with you know what we have and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good yeah so unfortunately the the uh computer equipment and and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly like for instance we bought a um-hum  okay was i supposed to do something no i had to press one good uh let's see so uh were we right in the Middle East sure should we have been there uh-huh did we do what was correct there i think we should have stayed longer should we have fought them harder used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used uh i think what we did was good but i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do oh you agree with Schwartzkopf who says uh Drive on into Baghdad yeah i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now And it's almost like they're killing each other off and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all would that be so bad was there anything there to begin with well i think i don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it um it wasn't ours well no i just mean that that the world in general well we've got to talk so it's just just as well we argue yeah Um i don't know i think we should have helped the the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more than rather than just quitting where we did i agree wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country yes But i think that's almost impossible next to impossible yeah so other political things that's going on i heard mister Bush say uh excuse me President Bush say that he uh wanted to improve the highways oh see i haven't really been keeping up with them so i really don't know what he said what did he say about it oh he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and uh-huh turn it into interstates like the rest of the country we don't have the money for that but wouldn't it be wonderful It would be really nice because i'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes and back east you all drive at fifty five don't you what's that oh okay um i say back east you all drive at fifty five don't you see out here in the west i'm sorry i dropped the phone yeah a lot of our secondary roads are fifty five uh-huh we drive sixty five oh yes well oh really oh really i uh last weekend went home to visit my parents my dad's in the hospital and uh uh-huh between here and west Texas there was probably three and four hours at sixty five miles an hour oh i didn't realize that nonstop have you have you ever been out here no huh-uh how far west have you been only in Ohio oh you've never i've never been past Ohio you've never seen the great American desert no huh-uh i've never seen anything out i never seen the great i've seen the Rocky Mountains i've never seen i've seen pictures of it but Mountains Yellowstone i've never been there i've seen pictures i just i'm a college student and um i'm paying for my own education and i'm i come from a large family and we we we're never able to take vacations because there's there's twelve kids in the family so uh well my college education uh thirty six worked for Texas Instruments for seventeen or eighteen now oh my uh know virtually nothing else uh yeah i got my four year got my BS in General Science uh-huh yeah i know it's a funny degree uh anyway uh i know nothing other than the west in fact uh really yeah down in east Texas where the company's located there's streams and water and things i don't understand trees and have uh-huh uh-huh the gulf and it's really interesting so tell me about where you live uh-huh well um i'm i'm originally from Butler and that's about an hour away from where i am now i'm at Clairon And um it's it's pretty like windy and hilly uh how high is the highest elevation oh i couldn't even tell you like uh probably it's not like a mountain it wouldn't be like a mountain it's uh three thousand foot oh i don't even know i have no clue close to sea level i would say it's closer to sea level okay uh right here in Colorado Springs where i live uh-huh it's over six thousand foot oh well see um um yes when i lived in Texas every year i had to drive you know i drove every year to the gulf and you know so i could have a feast of fresh seafood uh-huh six eight twelve hours away um you know just just for fresh i i'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of America uh-huh how many hours have you been from home uh the farthest away from home yes probably i'd say five or six oh yeah uh-huh uh now when i was growing up in the Panhandle of Texas l ook at your map later and see the the town of Amarillo uh-huh fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle to just go buy a pair of jeans we'd drive an hour oh my oh my gosh when i was growing up now things are different and people buy jeans in town but uh-huh uh we thought nothing at all of wake up waking up in the morning hopping into your car grabbing fishing poles and driving four hours oh yes Now see for me that's a long ways yeah it is i imagine uh-huh even well like i i'm in like a little town right now it's smaller than Butler and um Butler Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh So that will give you some idea of where i'm at and i'm about okay okay i'll look at my map later i'm about two hours north east of Pittsburgh wow how neat and uh i mean just this this little town here is basically a college town the college without the college here this town would be nothing It would be absolutely dead because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants and and in the summer when we come uh my fiancee's family lives up there we come up here in the summer and it's i mean there's just no one around so are you working your way through college um well i go home in the summer and i work in the summer and between what i make in the summer and student loans that's how i go to college well how neat what's your major finance finance uh-huh well that's interesting uh-huh so uh what do you plan to do with it um well like i said my fiancee savings and loans uh no No no no um my fiancee works down in D C and i'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a something i'd rather work for a company and um like be their financial advisor or something oh that would be great that would be neat let's see uh so we're all excited in Colorado Springs Apple Computer is coming to town uh-huh oh really yes the uh new employer in in the city uh-huh so we're expecting our local economy to take a boom a little bit uh maybe not a boom but uh at least recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still well well what would be the unemployment rate out there uh unemployment runs approximately six percent see that's what it is here too but now under employment i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent uh-huh and the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree yeah It's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs yes it is i know people they are out of school for two or three years and they have a job that has nothing to do  well who's the team well i think uh NCAA is going to go to Kansas oh really well i i'm picking Duke because uh they just won it they just won it yeah holy cow i just walked in i i didn't even i guess it's i can't believe it's over already it's just yeah it's just over just uh about five ten minutes ago i guess it was a good game uh they won by about eight i think what was the score either five or eight it was a good game but uh Duke was just too much for them Kansas just couldn't couldn't hang with them well i suppose they must be still must be pretty good if they took on UNLV so oh yeah and see i was i was really thinking that they might have a let down because i i i was in a basketball pot and i picked uh Kansas for i guess more or less an upset but i i was thinking that uh Duke might have a let down after playing such a tough game with UNLV but uh i tell you what they uh they came back and put it to them it was a good game but i i i had thought all the way through that UNLV was going to be the team that would just walk away with it well you and everybody else that's right that's right i tell you what they uh they they looked like they were just men among boys but they they they fell i tell you well a lot of pressure on them though i think uh i don't think they had the same type of enthusiasm enthusiasm or attitude probably too conservative or too yeah yeah they they just need to go for it instead of uh worrying about the other team because i think if they would play their game i don't know if there's anybody that could that could keep up with them uh yeah yeah well what about professionally but uh i i was since the i'm out in uh Phoenix uh Phoenix there so the Suns are starting to look pretty descent but there i think yeah yeah that's right yeah here in Dallas i'll tell you what the the Mavericks are having just all kinds of problems yeah i tell you well i used to live out there and uh seems like they've well Tarpley just got pulled over again oh really yeah so he he's uh he's probably going to be going to jail and and the problem with him is he's on a guaranteed salary like for three years so whether he plays or not they've got to pay him ten million dollars so if they uh they can't hardly trade him because nobody wants to pay that much for him and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guy's got Dallas in a big old bind but uh they they i think they've just got to forget about him and uh try to build a team without him maybe go for some good they ought to get some good draft picks this year who who else do they got on that team now i they've uh they've got Derek Harper that's a real good point guard him and Rolando Blackman yeah and uh really they're about it they've got a guy named Herb Williams that that i guess sort of was supposed to take the place of uh Tarpley but he uh he just doesn't have the offensive skills yeah and then they've got James Donaldson who's been there forever playing center and uh yeah how's he doing this year just all right but he's getting to where uh i don't know if it's his age or what but he just can't play the whole game they've got to get somebody young that can uh run the court that's still big how about the guy from North Carolina oh uh not McCrae but uh let's see are you uh Perkins Perkins Perkins they traded Perkins Sam Perkins they traded him he was from North Carolina and uh they traded him to the Lakers last year and that he was a good player and then they they've got a that's right that's right okay yeah he was a finesse player he was good yeah and then they they uh last year went out and got oh Fat Leever and uh Alex English and and Rodney McCrae Dantely didn't they get Dantely yeah they didn't and i'm not for sure what the deal is on him i think he's been hurt but he hadn't played he hadn't played in probably two months and i've i've gone to about three or four of their games and i don't even think he was on the sidelines so i i think he hurt his knee or something but he he definitely didn't turn out to be anything like he was supposed to so uh i think that was involved with the Perkins Perkins trade to tell you the truth it uh you know i i bet it was oh oh no no no no no no it was what is his name McGuire that was McGuire yeah that's right that's right from uh uh Detroit that's right that's who that was yeah because i don't think they got anything from Perkins i think he was a free agent or uh yeah yeah free agent his contract ended and they didn't sign him and uh i don't understand that i thought that he was always a good player you know he was but he just went for the the big bucks i think Dallas was going to pay him like sixteen million over five years and he got something like eighteen or nineteen million from Las Angeles so he just went where the bucks were and shoot you can't blame him man that's that's a phenomenal amount of money but uh yeah the Mavericks are sucking it up i tell you are they over five hundred uh no i don't think so they they were right before the uh uh oh what do you call it all-star break but ever since the all-star break uh shoot they've they've played terrible um-hum and uh so now it'd be really to their benefit to to really play uh some bad ball and and hopefully get a lucky uh lottery pick because uh there's no way they can even i think mathematically they're out of the play-off scene now yeah so you know they they need to just play for a play-off pick yeah i think i think the Suns are or a you know the Suns are are pretty good well they had i don't think it was last year the year before they were doing really good and i think they had an off year last year they're uh yeah and they did they made some trades uh oh they had one white guy i can't think of his name that was real good did you say white or black white uh Chambers yeah and uh Chambers yeah he's the big guy yeah you know if if they could get somebody to help compliment him you know i think they'd be uh awesome because that guy can play that Chambers is is something else but uh i don't know it'll it'll be interesting i haven't been i don't follow basketball real close but i i really don't follow the pros that close either they they just play so many games that uh you know it's just hard t o keep up with them but college i really enjoy college basketball yeah the big ten didn't fair too well in the tournament the most no they sure didn't sure didn't i'm i'm from the midwest so oh okay so you keep up with the yeah yeah i kind of watch you know see what's happening uh yeah more of a football powerhouse i guess but uh what's that more of a football powerhouse up there i guess well no basketball is you know Michigan won it last year is basketball pretty big do what yeah Indiana and Michigan uh and uh Iowa and i Ohio State Ohio State was ranked like number two most of the year that's that's true that is right Michigan won the NCAA last year and and you know there's always about six teams that go to the tournament uh from the big ten it's it's yeah so that's a tough conference they are they're really good in all the sports they huh actually in the last few years um football you know looks like has gone down a little bit so yeah because Ohio State used to be just a perennial powerhouse yeah and uh but uh and Michigan too but uh well i tell you what i appreciate uh the conversation and uh we'll have to we'll have to see how Phoenix ends up yeah we'll see you too bye-bye alrighty well uh have a good one okay bye-bye  good morning do you have a computer a personal computer yes i do i have um uh fifty megabyte hard disk on a so i got a i little you know lot of room for information i'm a i'm a programmer at work oh so uh but i i do all of my programming on the mainframe and i uh don't have a lot of opportunity to work on the PC except at home um-hum um-hum so i find it very interesting how about you um i have one uh a Wang or um sorry a Compaq portable that my son picked up at one point um-hum uh without documentation so it was very cheap it's a two eighty six uh-huh so it has no hard drive um-hum um so that's limiting i tend to use it to log into the the mainframe at work oh that's great and then i have a a Mac that i use for graphics and do you like the Mac real well um i don't there's something about the Mac a lot of things about the Mac i don't like i don't like the size of the screen i have an old uh Plus i don't like the keyboard but i it's extremely easy to use um-hum um-hum and it's very good for for graphics and actually i i mean it's to the point where programs are easily readily available and inexpensive so i did my income tax on it um-hum i have um uh it's not really a budget package but a a financial tracking package you know for my checkbook and stuff like that um-hum i've i've heard a lot of wonderful things about the Mac except it does have a limitation as far as the screen goes right and i mean you can you can buy an extra screen but but it's somehow because the screen comes with it it it always looks awkward to have the two screens that's true that's very true um-hum and i found uh my son is um uh second year college student and he in high school had no interest in the computer at all and so he when teachers said you know you have to type your papers at least with a Mac he was willing to sit down and type his paper and um um-hum uh-huh now he does play with with the the you know IBM clone um-hum but um and has learned quite a bit about it and tends to use it instead of instead of instead of the Mac so even without any propaganda and stuff he he seems to have switched is he interested in computers then did this give him an interest in it other than you know using it more as or less like a word a word processing machine he uh no i mean he sees it as a tool much as i do as a tool um-hum okay and um he no he's in international studies oh that sounds interesting too so he's basically you know whatever whatever the computer can do for you fine i'll learn enough to to make it work well for me but i'm not gonna be a guru uh-huh i understand that you have to have a certain i mean either you like them or you don't i think a lot of the people are afraid of them um-hum uh are intimidated by them i guess more than anything until they get get to uh learn what they can do and and how it can work right but i think that is it is very frustrating because you know you're sure you did X so uh-huh and it just doesn't work and and so you tell somebody who knows about computers and they say no you obviously didn't do that because the computer doesn't doesn't balk that's right and even even using it as much as i do you know and you'd you'd oh well i did that i know i did that you know and then the results come back and no you didn't they catch you every time so anyway i guess you have to have a sense a humor too when you're working with them right and talk to them and yell at them so um-hum yell at them and like to choke them so many times i wanna choke mine say you're not doing what i want you to do um-hum um-hum but uh i i have one mainly i bought it because i'm in uh taking a lot of courses along with work and it's very useful in that respect but i hope to do something more with it basically you're using it as a word processor you mean right exactly and it seems a shame to have all that equipment but uh not do anything with it but one day i hope to do more and what would you do i don't know i know there must be something more i can do with it but uh in my spare time someday i i hope to do something more with it i have a lot a ideas but putting them into work is another story um-hum right right so anyway well it's been very interesting well thank you very much for calling okay have a good day bye-bye okay you too bye-bye  there you go okay now i'm sorry excuse me and uh i do that we recycle uh newspapers we take you know the Dallas Morning News daily and the Plano paper daily and you know after a month of that you got a ton of newspapers right oh i know it builds up really fast it really does i do recycle newspapers and uh glass yeah yeah uh-huh we don't really have enough plastic to mess with we don't you know like we don't drink milk and we don't have children so we don't have you know six thousand plastic milk jugs a month you know yeah we do we have two a two year old and a three year old and so it really builds up with us yeah right but there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different uh container yeah and uh Plano has plans i believe it's tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year the city is going to leave uh receptacles at people's home and they can oh yeah that would be much more convenient yeah it certainly would and they can separate it and then the you know trash guys will pick it up yeah which would really be handy you know for people like shut ins or people who can't or don't drive you know they can't get to the these centers yeah or it just builds up so often yeah and i'm sure rather than try to uh ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them you know yeah yeah but i think that's probably a good idea they used to have several places um that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable uh-huh right so finally um they the people put so much pressure on the city they did a survey of everybody and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic uh-huh uh-huh and put it in front of the Wal-Mart store in town and they they it just really every every every time you went by there it was just over flowing uh-huh that's right and so Wal-Mart complained uh-huh yes so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be yeah great oh it was just like a dump there and so finally you know i called and they they said you know it was behind there and i started taking my things behind there i bet it was uh-huh so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly with two little kids and the paper but it just builds up it would be so nice if they had it uh-huh sure you know at your home where you could just turn it in so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area uh-huh uh-huh in one neighborhood and they have pickup there it's uh i think once or twice a week right uh-huh and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out so they had not much participation and they were going to cancel it but then finally people started getting the message yeah it's just a matter of education i think yeah and i think that you know if they can get enough going uh-huh they'll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city but it's not i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this and it's not going to be i don't think uh-huh yeah yeah that's right yeah i think basically it's a good idea you know i hope it works yeah i do to because it's amazing how much you know trash we can generate i know this year we took our Christmas tree they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little absolutely absolutely right um seedling to plant you know you could take the the uh-huh right mulch home with you you know and take buckets of that home so that was really good idea i thought uh-huh sure absolutely and there's just you know the two of us my wife and i and it's amazing how much stuff just just the two of us generate you know i can imagine a family of you know four or five yeah oh yeah it's really it adds up so fast yeah it really does as far as new stuff to recycle you know i don't really i don't really know i really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth yeah well they're working on diapers which would be great i've read so many different things about diapers and now their saying that uh originally they thought the disposables were just awful that's right i was uh-huh uh-huh but now their saying that they're there really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them and you know all different kinds of things too so that's right the the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those off uh-huh yeah so i don't know what's the you know right thing to do but i really would hope that they would come up i know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable but the landfill have to do something special you know for those uh-huh i see but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too so oh i'm sure it must yes you know i'm not personally involved because i don't you know i don't have any children that wear diapers but i'm sure it creates a large amount of you know uh refuse yeah yeah it does and you just feel guilty if you don't do something with them you know because you hate to contribute to the problem but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either that's right that's right absolutely that's right absolutely absolutely yeah i don't know what else they could recycle more of i guess we don't really use that many tin cans i guess there's some places where you can recycle aluminum but i don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff in i don't know if those are recyclable or uh-huh i think they're made out of aluminum um yes there are there is a receptacle you know at the centers also for aluminum but again we don't we don't generate that much so we don't yeah yeah we don't either yeah we usually use frozen vegetables and things so we don't really have much of that but that's right that ninety nine percent of ours is newspaper and uh you know uh glass yeah well now when we lived out in California they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car uh-huh or for aerosol cans and things like that because they say it's not safe to put those things in the regular trash uh-huh that's right car batteries yeah yeah uh-huh i don't you know i don't change my own oil so i don't i don't uh don't have that problem yeah well other than that i'm not really sure we we try to recycle old clothes yeah uh-huh yeah well we do to as a matter of fact our church has a place where you can take them and they you know pass them on to other families so right yeah yes we have one of those in town uh-huh yeah yeah you know our church each year has a one of their major fund raisers is you know a garage sale and there's a ton of clothes always you know left over and i take those down to the uh oh it's called the clothes closet that's what it's called here in Plano right uh-huh and they distribute them to the people that need them uh-huh kind of like a Goodwill kind of place yeah yeah yeah that's that's real helpful too uh-huh yeah well i'm not sure of anything i can't really think of anything else that we could recycle no i can't either i really can't um yeah no i i really can't either okay okay well it was nice talking to you you to take care bye-bye okay uh-huh bye-bye  well i'm uh an engineer so i'm heartedly in favor of this country converting to metric i bet you are i bet you are i don't know you know when i was in uh when i was in high school several years ago you know we did probably two or two or three weeks on the subject you know and tried to teach you the whole thing in two or three weeks and of course when you're that age you really don't care anyway and i didn't get into it very much but then i took a a list of a basic math class a couple of semesters ago and we uh we were pretty heavily into the metric system and and before we started i just thought oh no i don't want to do this you know this is just going to be so hard and once i really realized how easy it was uh-huh uh it was wonderful i mean it was just incredible how much simpler it is than what you know i guess we just all have this mind set that oh this is so hard and we can't do this and it's really not hard i was surprised at how very easy it was i think most people just uh you know automatically have their minds set against it and don't give it a chance you know so Yeah well i think uh you know from an elementary standpoint it would help to get rid of some of the the oddball conversion units like oh sure twelve inches to the foot and exactly exactly thirty six inches to the yard and things like that but uh i think uh from my work experience i found well when in college i learned uh to use a rationalized system of measure which turned out to be the metric system uh uh-huh and an awful lot of the problems that we did on exams and our homework assignments and everything else involved converting uh-huh from uh English units or nonstandard units into this uh rationalized M K F system um-hum and uh so i became quite accustomed to uh to a rationalized system and and used to making all the necessary conversions uh-huh and since then i have discovered uh other engineers are very prone to make mistakes because they will pick up a textbook and uh and find some formula for solving a problem yeah and they fail to realize that the formula is expressed in the the rationalized M K F system and they'll proceed to plug in inches and feet and pounds and uh things like that and they come up with a funniest answers you ever you can imagine uh-huh uh-huh it just don't work i bet i bet and some of them don't realize that they've made a mistake and so uh you know a lot of energy and uh a lot of work and so forth uh goes into building something only to discover it doesn't work right right well you know i think that the that the only way that we are ever going to get this country switched over to metrics is just to start other with with the kids right now Yeah you know you you you're going to have to start with the kids who are in school that are in when school and you're going to have to teach it well not like i was in school and do two weeks on it in a math class and that's all you ever hear about it you know they're going to have to start with the little ones and teach it right now and then when you know those little ones are our age you know that's what they're going to know and that's what they're going to use there's no way you're going to get you know most of the United States adult population to automatically relearn and switch Yeah you know it's just not going to happen that way but i do think if they would start with the kids now at you know in you know twenty years from now we could be switched over yeah i kind of agree that uh maybe ten on or twenty years ago we should have gone into a uh sort of a dual display arrangement where you know our our speed limit signs were you know uh-huh were sort of a double sign with a a big miles per hour and a little kilometers per hour type uh marking on the side yeah yeah i agree and then over the years the the kilometers per hour gets bigger than the miles per hour and eventually disappears they'll very good idea yeah yeah uh and little things like that i i notice in a lot of uh uh technical literature that you pick up and catalogs and so forth that you will find the metric units expressed in parenthesis or sometimes the other way around the metric units are expressed first and then the English equivalent that's uh is put into parenthesis for reference uh-huh uh-huh yeah i think i think it's going to take that but i you know i i think it's going to take a lot more than that too you know it's going to take it's going to take this education with our with our kids i really believe that but you know you it we we knew that we weren't going to have to ever use it again we knew we were going to have two or three weeks of it in math class so why take the time to really learn it yeah you know i mean you would you know learn enough to get by on the test and then you forgot about it because you knew you were never going to see it again in the rest of your years of school you know and and that that's not the way to convert over you're going to have these kids you know teaching it dually even you know teaching both systems which is a lot i know a lot more for the teachers to have to teach but that's the only way they're going to get switched over you know yeah i think also equally important is that uh it needs to be put into practice in in everyday life we're seeing a little bit of it now that you go out to work on your car and you discover your English wrenches don't fit oh yes yeah yeah yeah that's true too that's true you've got to go out and buy a metric set buy a whole knew metric set yeah well i think you know it's something that's going to take quite some time to happen but i i still don't think that they're doing all that it's going to take to make it happen you know it's going to happen slowly no matter what but there's going to have to be a lot more education involved than there is right now to get it to to get it to switch over uh-huh i was a little disappointed that uh United States is lagging the rest of the world but all of the other countries in the world have made the change and even the British which are probably the most stodgy oh yeah yeah uh-huh population and the originator of our English system of measure uh they have gone metric even they have switched yeah so yeah we're not uh we're not necessarily on the cutting edge in everything are we just like we think we are yeah right so well i think eventually it will happen you know it's just going to take it's just going to take a lot of education and a lot of time and like i said i was just totally amazed at how at how very easy it was you know i i just couldn't uh-huh you know i just when i going into it i just had this block and i went there's just no way i'm going to be able to learn this and when i sat down and really said okay just you know forget your old prejudices and really look at it you know and once you look at it's so really simple you know you there's really nothing to memorize there's nothing to learn it just all works the same you know you just you know transform that little you know dot from one place one way to the other you know and that's about all you have to do so anyway i think it will happen eventually yeah I i think one of the other concepts that uh comes along with using a rationalized system of measure is uh a technique of keeping track of units uh-huh when you're solving a problem that if you're sitting there trying to uh establish a relationship with some physical system uh when you come up with your final formula if you analyze the units of measure they should come out right uh-huh and the the basic units of measure are are distance and time and mass and electric charge uh-huh and so if you convert all your measure into those uh fundamental units and analyze them you can uh get a pretty good sense as to whether your formula is correct uh-huh maybe you left out a factor of pi or something like that but right right well you know i think uh i think it's going to happen i don't know i don't know what else i could suggest to them you know if they ask me what should we do i don't know i wouldn't know what else to suggest to them just education start with these little kids you know and like you said you know start making it practice you know start showing all the street signs and all the cars of course i think all the cars are manufactured that way they aren't aren't all of them most o f the new ones i'm seeing are are made with miles per hour and kilometers on them Well i most of them have uh the option the American American made cars have uh the the miles per hour as the big scale and they're little tick marks uh sort of hidden on the scale which shows kilometers per hour oh really right uh-huh But those that are manufactured for sale in in Europe and so forth are quite the other way around right and in a lot of the Japanese cars that come to this country particularly those that have the uh electronic panels there's a little push button some place on the panel that you can switch between uh kilometers per hour and miles per hour is there really huh my wife's uh Chrysler convertible has little buttons that you can choose what display you want to see well that's interesting yeah well Yeah i noticed my van has a uh a button on the temperature gauge that you can switch between centigrade and fahrenheit oh well that's interesting too i had never seen that yeah you know you look at most of the you know like the bank clocks and stuff like that it tells you you know fahrenheit and centigrade and it's going take those kinds of things you know switching you know getting us all accustomed to seeing both you know but most people don't pay any attention you know it's going to take some education right along with it most people don't know what that means you know so yeah well we also need to be a little bit careful and maybe we start to not use the English measure anymore like when you listen to the weather forecast the the weather man may give the temperature in centigrade and fahrenheit and everybody ignores the centigrade and listens to the fahrenheit to the fahrenheit that's right because that's what they're familiar with and we we sort of have to get accustomed to the fact that our body temperature is thirty seven degrees centigrade yes right that's going to be hard to do it's going to be very hard to do you know you and that it's a nice day when it's twenty five degrees outside you know i'm so used to saying oh my babies got a hundred and three degree fever and you know just say it's thirty nine is not just going to sound very bad you know yeah the Europeans think that you're baby is boiling over that's right that's right your baby's still alive with hundred and three so yeah it's going to take a changing lot of our old prejudices and you know just making up our minds that yes we are going to do this and we're just going to forgot this old way and we're just going to do it you know and i don't think the older generation is probably ready to do that you know Yeah no i hope we get to the point where maybe a couple of generations from now when somebody reads the old adage  okay Jay um could you tell me uh what your thoughts are about crime i tell you what here in Dallas it's uh it's awful bad because that they're i i believe there's starting to be a lot more violent type crimes uh where you see armed robbery and and uh rape and murder you know are starting to be a lot more prevalent in this area and uh that's that's getting that's getting scary because i grew up in a real small town and i moved here to Dallas and uh it's been a rude awakening i tell you oh so that's what do you do work in Plano uh right right how how far away is that from Dallas from the city itself well see it's it it's really just a suburb uh i really can't even tell where Plano starts and Dallas Dallas ends oh so it but uh i grew up in a real small town in north Texas and uh moved down here to Plano an and uh it's uh it's definitely a big change yeah that's uh that's the same with me well um i grew up in a rural area there's nothing but farms right and i still live in the same area it's it's built up somewhat and crime really hasn't been a problem it's been uh uh mostly outsiders coming in and you know robbing or breaking into automobiles and stealing uh i see radios and cassettes and things like that not really the violent crimes then not so much in in the town i live in now but but the closest large city in Rhode Island is Providence and then it's Boston which is about uh i see oh forty five fifty miles away i see which is really not that far right and Providence is only like a dozen miles from from where i am okay so that's real close but the cities down there yeah and and and the next one up is uh is a small city between me and Providence right and that they're stealing handbags now in broad daylight they're taking the the crime now the latest thing up here is uh they'll somebody be driving along whether they're they're in their early twenty's or or teens right and they'll steal jackets they'll holdup kids and they'll take their jackets and chains you know just get out of the car and oh Lord because they have got some of these like the leather jackets are are quite expensive right you know i've heard about that uh also for tennis shoes there was uh uh a big surge going on oh just last year i think where uh kids like in New York uh were uh knocking off other kids to get their tennis shoes they just that's that's incredible yeah i tell you what though if you go price some of those tennis shoes i can see why now you know they're getting up in the hundred dollar range yeah that's and that just seems ridiculous yeah for a pair of tennis shoes for a pair of tennis shoes yeah yeah yeah no shoe is worth that that price uh so that's right you know not to not to go out and scuff up and but i don't know what the it's i don't know what the answer is though to to try to fix that problem it's probably the uh the times now um right i know you guys down there have had have had a problem for a while which we're experiencing now with the savings and loans and exactly yeah just economic overall economic uh times around here in Texas have been tough yeah and rents are are extremely high i mean people and they just don't care yeah right you know it's either it's either you go out and you and you steal something or you you bash somebody over the head to get it yeah or you starve well another another problem i think is the the drugs you know uh people have to get money for the the drugs and yeah and they'll just go out and do anything they can to do it yeah we had we had uh an incident in our town not too far from where i live where uh the police made a raid on and and most of them were teenagers or or or in their early twenties right which is unheard of in a small town you know you don't usually associate associate that right but they did they made the raid you know and the whole town was upset but i'm not so sure now if if uh if the drugs are really prevalent they're saying that alcohol now is is uh one of the major contributors right like all of all the students now on campus uh i guess most of them drink or have binges on weekends and exactly and going to school is also always very prohibitive now unless your parents are wealthy right you know you either have to take a loan or most of them don't work or if they work they work part-time for yeah it's hard to get a job you know minimum wage yeah right yeah i'm not sure down there if you guys are all picking up but up here it's it's terrible you know we really haven't uh because the oil industry just hasn't come back like it was and so much of our economy was based on that so you're still suffering then so yeah yeah as far as that goes right that that and real estate you know just have not come back uh even close to what they were yeah and um yeah Dallas is you know you can see some economic turnarounds but uh and i don't think it will ever be back to what it was because it was you know it was really blowing and going there for a while yeah i was down i was in Dallas about uh twelve thirteen years ago and then i just went down again last month for a week i see and it was it's like one huge city when i was flying in right it was just all lights but you couldn't tell there was a problem right you know because it's so huge right part part of the problem too i think up here is i mean um and all the banking crisis all the white collar crimes uh stock brokers have been getting away with bloody murder the bankers have been getting away with bloody murder right nobody's being prosecuted that's right so what's going to stop them from you know other people to right what's yeah what's what's the poor guy going to do that's that's you know being threatened or thrown out on the street and he's got a family to support and he's got no job um i'm not sure how much of that is is crime rather than just kids out there for a good time yeah well that's true too yeah yeah but you know the violent crime is is uh definitely something's got to be done on that because yeah because there's more and more there's more murders we had uh right just in southern Massachusetts and Rhode Island over the weekend we had five murders golly that's ridiculous yeah i mean Rhode Rhode Island's just like a neighborhood compared to you guys down there it's just so so so small right right and nobody even cares or nobody seems to care they just overlook that as uh common occurrence yeah yeah yeah and if it's if it's drug related they turn the other way because that's one less problem that they have to put up with the law enforcement right oh that's and uh if they do come in i've got some friends on the police force and they say that you know they apprehend somebody and they bring them in and uh they let them out they're out on the street before they get their reports done golly that's terrible isn't it so there's no checks and balances right and i'm not sure what what to do about that or which way it's going to go well see i'm not either because i'm i'm really not for higher taxes you know to go out and pay for uh more people to be out on the street as far as the officers and things like that but uh yeah they're being overwhelmed i think anyhow i mean i think yeah that's true the fire power against them now is is atrocious and uh you know they've got all kinds of automatic weapons these criminals do right and these poor guys out there uh trying to uphold the law um i don't know i kind of think they should bring back capital punishment so i don't know well i do too and you know i know people argue that that's really not a deterrent and people don't think about that but i've i've got to believe that well in the back of their mind if they know they're going to go out and kill somebody and that you know they're going to get the death penalty then and that it will actually happen it's yeah yeah you know so many so many of these jokers get the death penalty and then you know just end up in prison uh yeah for twenty or thirty years or forever there's no right you know with the chance of even getting paroled and uh you know that's just i just don't understand that yeah um but and when i say there's no deterrent you know of the death penalty um that's like saying that you don't put up any stoplights anymore because it's not a deterrent for people to stop at crossroads right that's true yeah so it it just doesn't hold water and you look at some of the other countries that that have the death penalty right and they don't have anywhere near the crime rate that we do of the violent crime rates that we do right right because you know a lot of countries just shoot you on the spot you know forget that trial and the jury and all that you know they just yeah i yeah i wouldn't want to see it go that far you know give them due process and then and then let them and then do it huh and then let them appeal yeah then you'd get yeah because some of it some of it's it's it's just down right that's right uh mean i mean they go out there just just for the sake of of harming somebody right exactly and those are the people that you know can you rehabilitate them the some of the ones that are you know perpetual exactly and and um you know i don't even know if they are worth rehabilitating if if uh they go out and commit some of these violent crimes so but i don't know what the answer is we'll just have to i guess each each person will just have to try to do their part and yeah yeah he can because it's eventually it's going to it's going to swing back right it was they had the death penalty way back and then it swung the other way and everybody's swore you know we're no better than they are if we if we put the death penalty in and  so uh tell me about changes from say twenty years ago since you were an adult twenty years ago well let's see well we assume i was an adult twenty years ago um well you're you're able to you're able to uh vote and go to war and things like that so uh yeah definitely able to go to war twenty years ago but not vote not vote that was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years um yeah twenty years ago was nineteen seventy uh nineteen seventy i had been married two years oh that's right that's one of the changes uh-huh um we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixty eight uh-huh and uh around here on the uh east coast uh we were heavy into affirmative action yes and uh that was a uh a great shock for a lot of people uh-huh uh-huh and uh a great disappointment for some people like myself uh-huh uh-huh um i was gainfully employed by Safeway Stores Incorporated uh-huh and uh trying desperately to uh get ahead with the company uh-huh uh the problem was that my hair was too long uh-huh and uh that you weren't allowed to have a uh mustache or a beard and uh you know jeans just flat out weren't allowed unless you worked on night stock and uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh if you wanted to get ahead with the company well if you were a uh black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months if you were white male you're talking six years huh and that's basically where i ended up i uh i just flat out couldn't get a hold you know get ahead with the company because they were dead in affirmative action um uh-huh uh-huh on other fronts um and is the company now uh well represented uh demographically at the higher echelons did it work um i think so i i i i stopped working for them in uh seventy eight seventy nine uh-huh and uh it's i think they're they're like all companies well represented and uh you know everything seems to be fine i i've kind of lost touch with the company we had a falling out but uh um-hum um-hum uh-huh uh-huh as far as uh as their management goes um i'm not sure they're any any better off than they were were before management wise uh-huh but uh other changes um just people seem to be more outspoken now individually rather than collectively um back in the seventies we had uh a lot of uh protests against the war and uh bring our troops home and things were more organized uh-huh uh-huh and uh i've noticed that now more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together uh-huh uh-huh um so there's less you think now there's less of a a social movement and more individual movements lots of individual movements in a sense yeah i'm not sure if that was because you know eighties was like the uh the me decade and uh everybody was into me and then we are getting back into us but um it it the me decade uh-huh it's i've seen uh uh a great deal of change as far as um corporate responsibility and things um uh-huh uh-huh and people's response to that you know at first not trusting and now expecting more uh-huh uh-huh and what about what about the last ten years that you've been aware well that i've been aware of i've at least in my own circles i've been aware of an increasing from my generation i don't know if i can quite call myself a distinct generation from you but half generation off i guess um i've noticed uh a certain increase um pessimism with America no longer being sort of on top i had the impression well i mean there was the quote unquote losing of the Vietnam war which was a blow and it was right around that time when i started becoming socially you know a socially conscious adult and i realize that people of my age have no um no major success in the sense that uh you saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and um major social change in that sense and i and all the changes that have happened in the last uh even during my adulthood have been more incremental they've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made but there hasn't been the same sort of fiery speeches of Martin Luther King or whatever that has really uh galvanized the population and there's just instead there's been sort of an increasing oh i don't know Japan bashing and things like that uh-huh and uh a lot of i see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students who are you know maybe twenty a real sense of you know America's losing it yes and losing it in the competitive market and a real knowledge uh a lack of understanding how that could be and in the sense that how could America have gone from being number one to possibly being number two to you know our former enemies and things like that and um so i see i see a lot of uh a lot of pessimism growing um and at the same time i think there's there's there's a growing environmentalist movement and sense of corporate responsible increased corporate responsible towards uh you know environmental safety and things like that and that might potentially be sort of the civil right the equivalent of the Civil Rights Act in in the near future in terms of you know some real landmark bills passing and things like that such that you know people cause thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now i mean my generation doesn't can't rest on the the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that you know yes there's still some racism but you know basically things are the assumption things are basically kind of taken care of and there's a notion of fairness that um while still far from perfect is much more established i think yes but even uh i think uh along the line of the uh goals of civil rights um uh-huh there always seems to be some prejudice to someone by anyone i mean you know oh of course it's human nature you know don't like the way you look don't like the way you dress don't like your hair don't like you know it's just something that always sets people off you know you either like someone or you don't like someone or you're just completely indifferent yeah yeah and the problem is that ideally you they you know the world would like you to be completely indifferent so um but i i i understand what you say about the environmental movement um it's it's been a long time coming um being a uh a very old hippie uh-huh yes i mean you know if you had long hair in high school in the sixties you got labeled a hippie and you keep that image your whole life no matter what you do and i i just uh-huh yeah yeah i've seen a lot of changes i mean from the original earth day uh-huh and um i'm heavily involved in you know my own personal recycling we recycle paper and cans here at work and you know i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh you know all that stuff at home and i'm starting to see more and more recycling centers cropping up all over the place here on the east coast uh-huh r ight and that's a real change except it sort of brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else i mean all this recycling used to be in tact or not all of it but much of it did i mean recycling was a was a wartime thing yeah like yeah and then they turned around and called them junkyards and started making profits off them after the war yes yes and now we got to the point where the junkyards you've got to pay them to take something there so things have really changed a lot i think the uh the other part about uh America's decline i think has to do with uh-huh a perceived decline anyway yeah yeah the perceived decline has to do with uh um the attitudes and the educational system uh i have children in in school i have three children in school right now and i'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them uh i had when i was down in Dallas for two years i had uh my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong uh-huh and words spelled wrong not marked as such yeah and this person's teaching my children uh-huh you know i had a real problem with that yeah well i'd i'd say actually i mean as someone who's involved in education i'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society i mean relative pay which is a major way we value people has been poorer and poorer over the years uh you know that there's been cost of living increases but not quite in proportion to cost of living and you know it's just more and more uh a real low income sort of job and very low prestige i mean there's that that old saying those who can do it and those who can't teach this is the way of let's make fun of the teachers those are the people who can't do anything and if you have that kind of social attitude it's yeah hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay work for low social prestige just because they care about good education yeah and you get more and more people who would just end up there because it's uh it's the safety net of those of you know average intelligence or something they can always teach um i'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in Maryland but they're trying to get a uh a uh a merit system here in Maryland rather than a uh tenure system uh-huh for all the you know elementary middle school and high schools uh-huh so that the teach  well this is kind of ironic because i work in TI's legal department do you and although we don't have any criminal actions here we do have other um lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time uh-huh and uh when was it a couple weeks ago i was asked to go to uh jury duty i i wasn't selected but um for some of our cases in particular we have um very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such sure and it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just you know happen to be selected in our jury to understand what we're talking about well i do think that the cases like the uh oh say something like Texaco versus Pennzoil or or the Texaco Pennzoil problem uh-huh uh-huh uh is ridiculous for people just taken off the street to understand and really should have some better way where people who understand both the circumstances and the complex issues involved right should handle cases like that yeah you know some instances i don't you always have the option now in criminal i guess you always have a jury but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not oh is that right yeah and in some incidences i think they ought to ought not to have a jury um yeah oh boy or uh or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury uh i was only on one jury ever so far in my life and uh it really was a pretty trivial case and it seemed to me all the time i was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over this uh-huh case that involved oh a couple thousand dollars i think it was uh-huh really just uh uh terrific waste of everybody's time and money um and it finally ended up that uh even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it they settled the case oh they would they had settled while we were deliberating yeah now the one thing i did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case uh-huh and uh we were split uh ten to two so it was uh a good thing that it wasn't a total waste of time to have a hung jury on a case that trivial yeah well um i've never fully served i mean i've been asked twice to go down but i didn't get elected on the panel but i know that um for a lot of the civil cases it's rare i mean if your a lawyer um there you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the courtroom there's a lot of attorneys like that that never get to the courtroom uh-huh some their kind of law doesn't get them to the courtroom but even in um litigation which is doing lawsuits is a lot of times that you never get to the courtroom itself and well i think that the trial in a sense is kind of a threat to hold over people to try to get them to reach an agreement out of court because it does cost so much money yeah but it's a shame that oh it's not so bad for the court system because the money there isn't being spent but there's awful lot of money in time and effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get scared enough by going to the court and usually it's the scare kind of of the jury because you really don't know one way or the other how that jury is going to feel you could feel that you really have a very strong case uh-huh and that you're very much right but the jury may or may not see it that way so you get a little anticipate you know anxious there and go well you know sure yeah well you know i don't feel that sure and who knows what the jury will say because sometimes you know the juries come down with a result and you go gee yeah i was a witness in a case in a criminal case and it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded uh-huh um and that the jury was never allowed to hear and they convicted the defendant on as far as i could tell very flimsy evidence and two perjured testimonies oh really and i knew the people involved both the people who perjured and the people who uh were defendants uh-huh and yeah i think that was just a a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the uh you know staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury that uh were highly relevant to the case and could i thought have established the defendant's innocence yeah so uh i do although i'm a lawyer's daughter and i have lawyer's and judges on both sides of the family and uncles and cousins and things like that i really oh is that right think that we have gotten into much too legalistic of society and that we we spend far too much on the fine points of the law and far too little on achieving justice yeah and it seems a lot of times that uh especially in criminals that their rights are so protected but what about the rights of you know the rest of society i mean we're protecting this person's rights who has broken the law uh-huh um and we protect him so much but what about the rest of the society you know what are we doing for them we're kind of you know forgetting about them and i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of if he breaks law especially it he's a repeater the law shouldn't just always cover for him that some of his rights as should be taken well and then in a lot of yeah in criminal cases uh for instance you can't bring up prior convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case and it seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime yeah yeah and now it's possible that he didn't commit this one but the likelihood is certainly tilted yeah with a record like that and uh that was one of the things that we're not allowed to was not allowed in the uh trial i went to though uh one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony yeah had a long criminal record and had been you know a real sleaze bag um and he came in and was presented to the court as a fine upstanding young man who had uh been in seminary to become a priest and yeah you would have thought the guy was just pure as the driven snow but i happen to know his background and i know that he would have sold out his mother for uh uh shorter sentence jeez and you know it's it's really annoying when the i asked the defense attorney later why he didn't bring up all this other trouble the guy had been in he said that that was barred uh by the court um so we do have some problems and it seems to me that uh maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles and start over and then make a legal system that carefully protects people but uh where yeah i'd even go for for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable uh lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth yeah yeah that would be helpful yeah you know sure would yeah i witnessed one trial many years ago when i was first um studying to be a paralegal and uh uh they barred priors on this uh person and they never then told us i guess because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other um and they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other and the crime was uh uh attempt to commit murder you know and um but they never told us why these people were mad at each other and gee you know that's and you think that would be relevant yeah you know because they they told us in school that you know crime has to be an intent you know has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it because there could be accidental kind of things you know right but they never told us why these two people hated themselves or if one had done something to you know really aggravate the other there was never any motive uh-huh given and and i had a tough time with that and and being a person who saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did because we were just observing you know there in the courtroom uh-huh at the end of it all i still didn't know i still have a lot of reasonable doubts and i've seen everything presented yeah right and you know they just haven't done a real complete case here to my thinking uh-huh i think so and uh and i don't know that i want to sit on a jury like that and you'd still you know i want ask some questions here yeah that's something i thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen uh-huh and it seems to me that you'd get a lot more uh information if your questions were heard if you were allowed to ask the witnesses things or if or the lawyers things or even the judge uh-huh right but particularly the witnesses right yeah allow them to uh go back and and deliberate and uh you know after each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day bring those people back or if they would allow them to uh give broader answers they it's really kind of uh choreographed it's like a script has been written when people testify they aren't testifying really in their own words right yeah i can remember friends of daddy  so what kind of camping do you like well we uh as a little girl i used to go camping with my family and uh we'd load up our car and take tents and cots and all kinds of stuff and the place that we went the most often was uh in Oklahoma it's about a two or three hour drive and it is a little bitty national park right in the right in a town called Sulphur Oklahoma and it was real pretty had lots of trees and creeks to play in and it was a lot of fun so you like that more civilized kind of camping you got cots yeah probably so yeah well i'm i'm sort of a rough-and-ready camper i'll uh uh-huh whatever i can carry on a backpack oh is is what i go with yeah um when i was in the Air Force i used to be up in South Dakota uh-huh and there were some really nice places up in the Black Hills to go camping uh-huh and i had this really nice place you had to uh drive in as far as i could and then park and then you had to walk in the rest of the way uh-huh but it was across a little stream and it was sort of um uh not a big area but there was a perfectly round stand of trees uh-huh and it had a nice little area inside that course it gave you shelter and everything yeah and it was right next to a nice cold stream huh so it was my favorite place uh-huh and probably the worse thing that ever happened was around March the weather starts getting funny it will be warm one day and freezing the next yeah so but that's also about the time you start getting cabin fever yeah well i had cabin fever really bad so i loaded up the car and took off and i got up there and got camped or got got my camp setup uh-huh and that night it got down to seventeen below and started snowing oh my goodness yeah did you have uh very warm sleeping bag or oh i had i had a nice sleeping bag i also had uh uh catalytic heater oh my goodness um but i woke up and the snow was halfway up the the front of the tent i'm going oh no i go out i had all my stuff set i had my little campfire thing setup and my my pots and pans and stove and all that oh yeah and i get everything's buried under snow so i'm out there digging around so i think well to hell with it you know i'll go i'll go play around for a while well there's this fallen tree across the stream and these streams of course are felt fed by melted snow so they're cold anyway uh-huh yeah oh yeah so here i am going across this snow encrusted log oh no and i slipped and fell in oh no and crashed through the ice right up to my neck in freezing cold weather i could just feel my heart going oh oh oh no uh how did you get out of that well fortunately i had the presence of mind when i slipped i just i just went with it i didn't try to twist or anything uh-huh and as i went i just turned and stuck my arms out and i hit the hit the log with my arms uh-huh and that pretty much saved me from going all the way under yeah um anyway i finally pulled myself out and i mean just as soon as i got out my clothes started freezing oh man oh that's awful yeah so i i trotted back to the car rather quickly uh jumped in went home and took a hot shower and changed clothes and went back oh my goodness oh that's quite an experience i probably would have had a heart attack and died right there on the spot it was i think i almost did that was something oh that i bet yeah i i enjoy camping i like getting out especially i don't i don't understand these people people take these camper trailers and stuff i mean that's that's not camping i mean that's like yeah yeah yeah that's just like moving to another area for a while yeah i mean here you are you got you know you got showers and stoves and refrigerators and TV's and air conditioning yeah yeah i mean good grief that's not camping i know it's kind of funny i like to rough it yeah well did you go camping by yourself then you didn't go with other people or no usually i went by myself it was sort of get away from everybody time huh yeah and you've been locked up with folks all winter it's time to get away by yourself yeah yeah and it was so it was so nice up there that just i mean it was so quiet and peaceful yeah well that's nice yeah it's nice nice area yeah just a second uh when i uh planned my little uh schedule of when i could talk on the phone this one was suppose to be asleep and she's not cooperating yeah she fooled you yeah i think so uh i've got three kitty cats and they were suppose to be taking a nap and oh one just crawled up in my lap and every time she hears me on the phone she's got to come sit in my lap yeah wants you to got to be got to be part of the action here my kids want a cat so bad and uh i'd i'd like to get them one but we live close to a busy street and almost everyone has a cat it's been hit run over maimed you know and i just can't stand the thought of it oh yeah all all mine are uh purebreds so i keep them in so yeah keep them in the house yeah especially well that may be our only option if we ever get one especially especially this one huh she's a mess huh aren't you kitty cat well this is real interesting that you're as far away as you are because i really thought this was uh uh we're sort of like TI exclusive yeah TI people yeah and so i just figured no it's just this area you know yeah well that's interesting have you had many calls well you're my third one and i have never gotten the courage to do it myself isn't that funny well i tell you it's it's easy to do it's just uh like when i started calling you it was two twenty my time one twenty your time i guess uh-huh uh-huh and however long it took however long we've been on that's how long it took for some for the computer to find somebody for it to oh my yeah i've been sitting here and sitting here and sitting here oh i never thought about that that it would take a long time to find someone available i didn't think it would take as long as it does but like last night when i made one uh-huh the long that was the longest one i waited thirty five minutes oh my goodness and sometimes you'll get it on the first try i mean it's just yeah i guess it depends on the time of day too yeah this is not a real good time of day because most people listed their home numbers and of course they're gone yeah yeah but i've got a class tonight so i wanted to get these out of the way yeah this is this is my thirtieth call oh wow yeah that's great well i got a catalog that you know shows all the gifts and things you can get and yeah uh-huh i started getting inspired thinking oh we need to do this i'd like to have a few of those things yeah the only reason i'd do it is because i want to make sure that i get all my calls in before they they just up and pull the plug on the program you know yeah that's right and they probably will soon so yeah because being a student i'm doing it for the money yeah yeah i can see that i want to make sure i'm i'm my roommate does it too huh well that's pretty neat yeah well it'll be a nice little bit of money we're going to yeah yeah every time i've talked to one of them my husband said i can't believe that you made five dollars every time you do that it sounds easy so he signed up to do it but he's never done one so well of course there's this other one that i've i've talked to fairly regularly in Dallas um same thing her husband signed up for it and she's the one that does it i know yeah i know it's crazy but he'll spend the money i bet that's right yeah he'll say yeah i did that yeah we're going to take the money and get uh go out and find a nice stud for Himy Persian oh yeah she's a she's a beauty we're going to going to get a nice litter off of her well that will be neat yeah she's she's so sweet too oh i tell you my kids would love to they'd just want any kind of a cat bless their hearts and like i said um i really would like to have one too because i know how much they want one It's just hard one my youngest daughter has asthma and uh been a little afraid to have a cat in the house all the time with a child that has asthma yeah so i thought well i need an outdoor cat but if i have an outdoor cat i'm afraid it's going to get hurt so uh-huh i have a problem yeah that's that's bit a problem i mean you could always buy a uh you could always buy a Sphinx yeah those are hairless cats of course they're huh i don't think they'd be too fun oh they are they're they're loads of fun that's the most playful cat around are they huh but they on the other hand too they cost twenty five hundred dollars oh my land i'd be scared to death to have anything that expensive yeah my my roomy wants to buy a a Sphinx huh and i keep saying no no no oh i've never heard of that no yeah we both decided on a Devonrex though it's sort of like a Sphinx it's a very short haired cat huh it's almost like just fuzz huh but uh they're substantially cheaper yeah i would hope so we're we're into this breeding business pretty heavy now and he well that's good yeah as long as you don't lose sight that they're still kitty cats yeah yeah and they're fun to have around yeah i guess so this one here is just sweet oh that's neat she's kneading on my my stomach pushing and pushing and drooling quit drooling on me look at this i'm wet well it was nice talking to you i think i'm going to have to catch my daughter before she eats any more candy when i'm on the phone that's her sign that she can do what she wants to do oh that's it all right it was good talking to you yeah you too talk to you later Janet bye-bye okay thanks good-bye  okay do you want to go first well i could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic fitness and exercise oh God No why don't you go first okay um i like to do uh weight training and and cycling and just walking uh and swimming i i used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until i had some knee surgery last fall and the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore so i had to kind of change my lifestyle a little bit well let me ask a personal question how old are you thirty eight oh well then you you get the over thirty five everything goes downhill flop uh well the the rest of me is in pretty good shape it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to oh well you're lucky then because i've battled arthritis all my life i mean even since i was like about two or three that's when they diagnosed it and usually most people are just absolutely crippled and uh i do water aerobics really ooh oh i bet that helps religiously do water aerobics um-hum i used to do it about six times a week and now i'm down to about four but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in shape in in there uh i tried weight training and i'm telling you you just i just can't lift the things yeah and the shock on the system is is just too much so i have stuck to water aerobics basically you know the weightless thing and yeah trying to keep in shape that way but you know it's hard to find i mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what i'm finding is that if they do offer it you get the crowd of women that are i think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way that's right that's right to get in shape without having to spend anything or it's the geriatric crowd that's right so i've considered even becoming licensed to teach it well i mean if if you know what your routine is you can do that by yourself and you probably do yeah but you have to have an indoor pool this is true so to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without you know drawing a lot of looks means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity you look very odd in the water that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training well now at and that does look very odd in the water i can believe that have you tried the uh the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center no and you know that's the only place i haven't tried and people have told me now that's the Texan facility yes i have been told that thing is just lovely it is they keep it at eighty one degrees year-round huh have do you use that facility a lot um a fair a fairly a fairly good amount uh more on the weekends uh i try to beat the traffic in the mornings when i workout in the mornings i try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center hum do you know if they have child care there um have you done your attitude survey for this year yet you need to put that on there seriously they don't i don't i don't work at TI oh you don't no i used to work at TI as matter of fact i was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position actually when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry and i used to fill out those attitude surveys and uh oh yeah uh me and the uh insurance adjusters adjusters are are very familiar with each other and my husband still works there and uh yeah i get my attitude expressed through them but i find it to be very sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short sided mentality to save a few bucks uh and this is true never having lived in Texas before i started to work for TI and i came down here and you know they did an attitude survey like six weeks after i had been working here and i asked about you know day care for the shift workers and yeah boy i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that you know and it's not applicable to me and i was kind of horrified well it's not now what year are we talking about we're talking nineteen seventy eight okay uh things have become much more enlightened since then they couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages yeah you know we still don't have a day care facility but people are more sympathetic to it i understand i understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care and uh the reason i'm at home is when i had my kids and i was scheduled to go back and i tell you how much in the dark ages it was um yes yes i had been rated number one in the field and then i took uh when i became pregnant i also got meningitis and then delivered the first baby three months early ooh my gosh and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment sure could you hold the phone for one second thanks okay i'm back and then they used to uh and then i had a second one eighteen months later they told me to put them back to back and of course to maintain and i was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one because that's when i go into labor that's like four and a half months and i don't even know it wow of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back oh yeah very easy very easy and they they put me on twenty four hour fetal monitoring then to to you know to to try to control the labor and see how far it was going and after the baby was born since it wasn't premature then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor i think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof because it was a uh thirteen thousand dollar really bill but after the second baby was born i was going to go back to work and that was when they had God it would have been the eighty five layoff yeah yeah and i'll tell you how they handled this and i was just outraged i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been uh terminated until i filed my insurance claims about four months later and they didn't have any coverage under my name and i went back and i said what the hell is going on here you know and they told me that uh oh well you know you know your husband works here and he's got a good salary we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway and uh yeah really you know we've got people here that really you know need to be working and so that we had just you know it was this way we didn't have to layoff an active person and we'd just let you go and it took me about a year of arguing i said you know you've got to put this in writing to me and because until they put it in writing i couldn't get my insurance benefits and i couldn't get my uh termination benefits either yeah there you go i was just pissed as hell that they could do that i i can believe that but i i guess things have gotten better i've been told that there's flex hour and those kind of things oh yeah flex time is great i still don't think that they after my experiences that they could you know get me to go back ever again i i can understand i can understand well it's been good talking with you but let me ask you this since you use T exans how much is it a month yeah oh shoot it's only about ten bucks a month now is that for an individual yeah i mean uh to add dependents is is you know maybe another dollar or something it's no big deal that's it yeah now are if you if you if you pay your your monthly charge do you then pay separately for classes you're taking uh you do for classes for classes but to i mean to use any of the facilities is is no extra charge God that's cheap yeah it is that's really cheap do you have to be an active TI employee to join Texans or or or a dependent or a dependent of one or the dependent on God i am so dependent these days it's offensive to me alrighty well i i'm seeing that my my codependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbors fence really wonderful yeah so my uh position from management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment but boy i think i'm going to go contact Texans i really think i am i mean that beats any offer i've heard in a long time yeah oh yeah it's great huh alrighty when you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell uh well it would depend on when you go it's not it's not excessively crowded on the weekends see i'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty oh i don't think that would be bad at all if you're in Richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the to the Dallas site oh i i'm actually right on the Plano line oh well then you could go either one the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern has a lot more yeah niceties amenities and you'd probably like the pool there oh God it sounds like i would i might do that then okay i learned something here well i'm good i'm glad well thank you you have a good day bye-bye you can go back to work now thank you bye-bye  well in the norman in in the normal route of way we do things how about the ladies go first alrighty um well i uh have have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year so i'm really just starting to get involved in uh in what's out there and how they do things um as as far as the system as a whole i really don't see a a problem with it i do see a problem with graduating people that that can't read and are not you know productive in society or productive to themselves and uh i think that's the main problem at this point how about yourself all right i'm uh live in Plano Texas and uh um uh-huh uh today we're not even suppose to be in school because the uh the way the taxation and all that crap is there really legally isn't any funding for the school systems in Texas today right so uh i mean when you when you take uh uh professionals and put them in situations they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education and they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to to get that major subject in line something's wrong so i think here in Texas mainly that the the they're not serious they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what how the level of education should be for children i have a one year old so i'm not i'm more opinionated about the observations than than the than the true facts but uh-huh uh it's just a shame to me that that that the our firemen our policemen and school teachers are the three least paid utilities um that have the biggest impact to our well-being that's true i have a i have a real issue with that um i think that if from every year when they when they pull in the the the the uh test that the last three years you know ten eleven twelve year uh graders take and and and you see that their their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states then that's saying that something's wrong with the educational system here in Texas and i have a real concern with about that um um matter of fact i'm very content to send my daughter out out of state to college in in Virginia uh verses having her go down here and not learn anything and then uh so i'm uh-huh my my opinion i think i think there's a big concern uh hopefully hopefully the new uh education secretary of education will do something to fix the problem but uh i don't know they got to quit worrying about uh the uh religious uh overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product yeah i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people you know special interest groups can blow up um-hum and uh and not really get down to teaching what's important teaching these kids you know how really the basics is what it comes down to exactly i i was astonished to find out that that across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed is that right half they don't even a lot of the school systems don't even uh the kids nowadays don't even know what what the President's uh Fitness Education Program's all about they don't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school huh i remember and yeah and uh i'll i talked to a thirteen year old last night who's uh goes to uh one of the Plano schools high schools or or junior highs i guess and she said that that she had a a choice she could either have taken tennis or weight lifting so she chose to take weight lifting over the regular gym i mean give me a break i mean the the the kids sit there and they drink and they drink Cokes and eat popcorn for for for lunch for lunch and then go out there and lift weights and talk yeah and don't learn anything it's just a real i have a real problem with the whole system they need to put some sternness back into the into the teachers and let them be able to uh get the old whip out and get some discipline huh yeah then it comes down to what you said before though about them being uh some of the lowest paid public you know public service um-hum employees that there are and yet they're so important i used to i used to date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level uh-huh i mean i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she they would that she was paid true she was young you know but still it's the principle of course if she got her Master's degree it'd all be different but uh right well you know it's hard though because then you start talking taxes and uh that's bad word oh taxes lord forbid forbid lord forbid taxes goodness gracious if we would uh plan our expressways a little better that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads we'd cut that in half and give to the teachers we might have such a problem there's an idea maybe i should run for office huh run on that then no income taxes in Texas huh i'm in Texas too so this is true that's funny that's funny well gee well that's about all i have here well me too i uh i think we both agree there's some problems there but yes ma'am we'll small maybe do our small part to fix them up surely i've enjoyed it bye bye all right you too bye  yeah auto repair tends to be a a topic that a lot of people don't uh don't like i guess because it's usually expensive and uh people end up not pleased with the job sometimes or not pleased with what they had to pay for it so uh i guess it's kind of a sour grapes type topic i just recently had um that's right put a set of brakes on my little Blazer that we have and fortunately i i could do most of the work myself but uh this last time that i got into it i got about halfway into it and started feeling a little bad i kind of fluish type and said what a time for this to set in i got the wheel off i got these brake pads off i got car jacked up and need the car the next day type deal so get sick with the flu yeah so uh i continued on and just decided to do part of what i had intended to do when i got inside there which means that when i just get around to doing the rest of it i got to take all of that back off again and uh-oh and uh start over so uh with little things like that it's it's still a lot cheaper uh that particular for that particular model car runs a hundred and fifty dollars wow are these disc brakes yeah just the front little disc pads but uh while you're in there you usually uh pull the rotor and and uh turn it down and right put the uh grease the bearings up since it's been a while since they'd been done and well i have Nissan uh Maxima and i had the rear brakes on those um-hum redone but i guess auto repairs are cheaper around here i think it was around eighty five dollars um-hum yeah the rear brakes just doing the just putting the brake pads in wouldn't be too expensive but it's when while you're in the front that you usually go ahead and pull those is expensive uh-huh that rotor off and repack the bearings and you know that's twenty five dollars and the rotors another twenty five dollars and then the brake pads are eighty or something the labor and parts and uh-huh i just go buy the things for for uh about thirty bucks and put them on myself uh-huh but uh it's a bit of a bit of a pain and you have to schedule it you know get around to find a weekend you can do it and all but still for the for the savings it uh works out usually you're very fortunate well i ran into a problem with my car uh course we have a little colder weather up here and i had set the emergency brake after we'd had a freezing rain apparently um-hum and there's some kind of a boot that had had come off the car so the emergency brake froze on um-hum and my uh brakes were on all the time i drove to work one morning oh boy bet that got warm it got warm it was pretty smelly by the time we got there which is not too far a drive but yeah that that was the reason i had to replace mine yeah that'll do it it'll cook the whole whole insides there right hum i don't know what the what the solution for that would have been you would have thought they would have put all the parts pertaining to that near the brake so if they did get hot they'd unfreeze you would hope so but that would be nice if uh all that was huh that's interesting yeah i'm glad we don't have that problem too often down here i've heard a lot of horror stories about people that go down a straight road long enough and the and the wheel wells ice up enough inside where you get ready to make a turn and and surprise you can't turn and you can't stop in a hurry and no i'll stay down here in the South that's that you can't turn that's right it's a little bit different i've seen your spaghetti bridges though when i wouldn't want to go over them yeah that's true that's true well i guess the only other uh things that i like to do you know the oil changes and things that are not worth paying for at least in my neck of the woods so we do that kind of maintenance and you do that yourself yeah do the oil change oil and filter and air filters and spark plugs and the like can't do much in the way of actual tune up now that the car now that computers taken over that control oh you're that's right um it costs about a hundred and something to get the small module that reads that and i've thought about taking a course just so i could change my own oil but and that would help a little bit but i haven't done it yeah well i'll tell you some of the horror stories that the the male populace have done to the women i i recall a a uh coed when i was in college some of the guys got together and decided to tell this poor girl the way to change her oil was to uh they showed her where to take it out and she did that successfully and then showed her how to uh put it back in but on putting it back in they had her put in they had her put in all four or five quarts of this oil with an eyedropper down the dip stick oh no and she did it oh and it was just oh that's crazy that was mean that is mean yep so i guess it it is to your advantage to either not have friends like that or take a little course in or take it to the pit and let them let somebody else do it yeah yeah those have really cropped up years of late but uh they have but i really hate paying twenty two ninety five for an oil change yeah yeah that's when i know what the oil costs that's true i usually try to catch the oil at eighty cents or so and right uh-huh and uh stack up on a case of that and grab the two dollars filters when they're on sale and wait for a good weather and go out there course getting rid of the oil is getting harder these days right uh well end up having to take it somewhere right some of the stations around here will take it right i think maybe they have to accept it well they get a little money for it i mean they they pay they sell it so they should be you know unless it's a hassle or a labor recycle it in you know just dealing with the customer maybe that's there only reason why they don't it'd seem like they'd just put a little barrel out there and say it pour here and go on we'll take your money that's right um we were down in Dallas right after Christmas and on the way back we stopped in Louisiana to visit my brother and we were driving my husband's Toyota pick up truck well we made a quick little stop when we got to Baton Rouge and he came came back out and the car the truck wouldn't stop i mean it wouldn't start so gave it a somebody came along and helped give it a little push and the next morning they took it to the garage and it was just a small private garage and he said it was the starter motor proba bly and he was going to take it off and either repair it or replace it or whatever and we got a call in the middle of the morning and he said i've got good news and bad news uh the starter motor is fine it would it just had a couple of bolts that held it in place um-hum and one had been broken off right and allowed it to shift enough that it wouldn't um-hum wouldn't catch right match just right and the only bad news was my husband would have to go to a garage and pick them up pick the bolts up for him hum so he went to a used car garage i guess or place and got the bolts and yeah had it running for about fifteen dollars i couldn't believe it because the man could have really stuck us well that's not yeah that's true that's not to bad then no it was great well i hear my kids are needing me again so i'll go see what they need and we'll maybe talk to you again okay Greg okay thank you bye um bye  well Patricia i was just about to get on my tread mill and then i remembered that i didn't make a call last night and i thought i'd make one tonight well i have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom but it usually's holding clothes that's what i did with mine for a long time put it on the handlebars so i can hang them up right and sometimes she just flops them all over the seat well that's not why i got it right how do you like your tread mill uh-huh i like it you don't get is it less boring than the bicycle or not no it's just as boring you watch TV or something while you do it i read a book while i'm doing it but i was doing that on the exercise bike oh yeah i do that too i feel like i'm getting a little better of a workout and i'm losing more weight on this than i had on the other and my legs you know how okay i'm going to turn forty this summer i was getting all dimpled up really are you a yeah and those are going away really so that's real good uh aren't they kind we got it at a little bit of an incline are they kind of expensive uh this one yeah this is five hundred ooh i know they get cheaper but i don't know uh-huh oh do they probably the more you pay though the better the machine you have well i hope so well you can believe that anyway right yeah i didn't buy it really my husband bought it because we we'd we'd never get out and go walking or anything and we go to the lake and we ski and swim in the summer but during the year yeah well in bad weather you know well you'd have to do something inside do you work at TI besides that uh-huh yeah uh-huh not uh-huh i think your voice sounds familiar really where do you work i live in Arlington i wonder if we talked before where do you live i'm in Garland no uh well you sound like this girl that i talked to about books and we got into movies one night oh really uh-huh uh no this is the first time i've done it uh my husband was just running out the door he's working at night tonight so i decided to do it i haven't talked before uh what subjects have you talked about let's see education uh social changes that we've seen in the last ten twenty thirty years yeah that one was well that's interesting it's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle right the most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner oh my goodness the other woman didn't cook too much either right they really have a lot of variety yeah they do i talked to this old woman that was a retired administrator in Ohio one night about education and she was oh a a school administrator well that could that would have been interesting uh-huh she retired but yeah and then one night i talked to these two guys no one night i talked to one guy and then a couple of weeks later i talked to the guy's roommate in Virginia about different things really well that's neat uh-huh one was about painting um when was the last time you painted something did you feel like you did a good job did you feel uh rewarded while you were doing it i don't know hm how long is this going to go on do you know i don't know i don't either it's interesting though i never heard of such a project before well how'd you find out about it pardon me how did you find out about it oh i don't know i guess my husband got a letter at the office i i presume and they must have been asking does your husband work with TI uh-huh oh really uh-huh i have a friend that had a roommate that worked at TI and she saw it on the computer screen and they made copies of it uh-huh are you a oh so they wanted any anybody don't have to work at TI uh-huh well that's interesting i had no idea that was just for the employees and i couldn't understand i kept getting these calls i thought it was an advertisement and they just were also called TI you know there is Texas Industries and different things uh-huh uh-huh i kept hanging up on them for days until my husband told me what it was oh i didn't know well if you work for TI you're supposed to get a prize is what i heard and if you don't work for them you're supposed to get cash but then on the letter it says cash or prize yeah they really oh oh well the prizes are pretty nice he brought a booklet home and depending on how many calls i think three was the minimum but it went up to i don't know nine or ten how many calls have you made had i don't know gobs well it sounds like a lot this is going on my fourth week to do it oh my and some of the prizes were you know pretty nice but i didn't well like what tell me oh i wish i had that booklet here oh i think i do it's right here uh i'll look at the end because those would be the best ones okay yeah uh um well they have some watches that look really nice there's one that's got some diamonds on it for how many calls well it says F i haven't quite figured that out i thought it was eight or nine but seems like too nice a prize for nine just nine calls doesn't it does it say uh-huh it says uh-huh when we have enough calls from you you will receive in the mail a numbered certificate for your calls and and explanation how to redeem you need to start the grill for gifts are you li stening to him no i'm trying not to he's telling me to start the grill okay oh it says three for a B gift five for a C gift et cetera and this only goes up to F so i thought that was somewhere around nine but anyway it's got these beautiful watches on it let me see what else it has a uh uh clock radio that also plays uh uh you know uh tapes then it's got oh some binoculars and some pretty brass lamps it's got some oh a food processor so it's not all stuff that TI makes oh no i don't i haven't seen anything in here that TI makes the Mister Coffee the double Mister Coffee you know the two oh and there's a phone in here that's hilarious it has a button you can push if you get a call you don't like then it makes machine gun noise i've never seen that before then there's an attache case and cordless telephone and then there's a card table doesn't have any chairs just a card table oh some more jewelry suitcases and have you seen those university anniversary lamps where the little balls go around you mean the clocks yeah clocks is what i meant i can i'm going crazy my daughter's playing the piano and i can't think yeah oh God it's got one of those and well it's got a lot stuff i mean pages and pages it's got wheelbarrows i'm trying to look for something a lot of kitchen stuff lots of kitchen stuff the mixer a toaster a waffle maker popcorn popper all kinds of stuff like that and here's where here's a calculator but it's not even made by TI isn't that funny did they mail that to you or he brought it to you he brought it home i believe it came in his uh his mail here's a camera and a dustbuster and some tools someone a lot of tools a man might like you know huh yeah so you're bound to find something you want oh yeah you're bound to all kinds of phones and clocks and and uh here's more jewelry and oh there's even pictures and little porcelain things to put on a coffee table oh here's some brass animals brass candlesticks they're pretty so i'm sure you'd find something yeah and uh well you know uh and there's even some silver plated bowls and stuff there's a lot of stuff it's a big booklet well do you know you have a ten limit a ten minute time limit well that's okay and then they come on and tell you and they tell you got five seconds to say good-bye oh no you've talked enough oh oh well it's been fun this is my first time to do it we'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else let's see right do you let's see oh i tried exercise classes and i never would go we find we joined exercising yeah my husband keeps telling me to i went i went back to college a couple of years ago so i sit and study i sit in class and i have really ballooned up since then and uh-huh so he's says i ought to join one of those that makes you go but they're and you're saying it doesn't then you pay all that monthly stuff you know they don't either well well the first one i joined they went out of business and they transferred it to another one that was really far away that's a very common experience you know uh-huh and we were going to do it there was four of us together well then forget that it wasn't near me uh-huh no and then the second time i was going to do it at Richland College and we i just get with another friend and we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place yeah that's funny so my husband's just discouraged me on those things right well if you if you can make yourself do the tread mill i mean gosh that's a good workout oh yeah my husband said he's never joined a course right and i got one of those Jane Fonda workout tapes that i dubbed from a friend that didn't last long i got one of those after i had a baby i think uh-huh yeah right each one of those puts on a few pounds doesn't it definitely two how many children do you have yeah i do too two a girl one's in college so i don't have a have a baby anymore oh Lord you're lucky well i've got a stepdaughter she's in college oh well so there's where the money goes yeah tell me about it tell me my lucky husband's putting two of us through isn't he lucky where's you kids two well me i'm going and my daughter down in Austin we uh yeah right so i'll probably have to sell the prize i get where you going to school UTA right here and what are you doing well i'm um going to be certified as an English teacher and an ESL teacher you know English as a second language yes i do i just got my certification huh-uh you're kidding oh that's interesting the test is a booger it the test the exit test it's hard it is so hard pardon me it's hard oh no really really how are the other ones i haven't taken any of the exit tests see i didn't have to take any other exit test because i've been teaching for quite a while oh yeah before they started all this stuff but i've heard they're terrible really hum bilingual is just horrendous i've had friends fail that twice really oh really i didn't know any of this none of my friends have failed the English or the education ones good and i really ought to take those quickly while i still remember something yeah right after you get out i know i know i know how are those ESL courses i'm just starting this summer boring and they really don't help you a whole lot now see i went to ET and i took one course through TWU you're kidding uh-huh but most of the good training i've got has been through Dallas just teaching ESL see i'm a Chapter One Teacher and some of my classes are ESL oh they give you yeah oh oh  okay what types of music do you like to listen to well i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers partly because i find it more soothing i don't know a lot about classical music so far as uh any background in music but it's the the music i enjoy the most how about you i like classical music also i uh like you i don't know a whole lot about it and i i would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff but i'm not sure which composers or which i really like so i kind of hesitate to buy something There are certain kinds i like and certain kinds i don't right uh-huh i tend to listen to the classical music uh on the radio a lot there's uh one particular well there several stations in this area that play uh classical music all the time but there's one in particular that is on both AM and FM so i can listen to it without uh worrying it's cute though because my children when they get in the car and i have uh the button pushed for that they always switch it to something else because naturally that isn't their taste yeah at this point in time anyway yeah i understand that are are you involved in music uh no not really My husband is but not i do uh the world a favor and i don't sing aloud to anybody but myself well my whole family uh is somewhat musical um and not from training but just because we sing in our choir and my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing so um i think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music too because that's usually what happens if you unless you get into rock which isn't her voice style so yeah i yeah i i don't care for rock at all i guess i'm real old fashioned in my musical tastes no i well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious yes it's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning now i do like folk song um and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that you know kind of still hang around right but um but the more popular music i don't care for usually yeah um even when i was a teenager i didn't really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked um a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular rock and roll kind of thing yeah i agree with that too although now i kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll i guess it makes me think i'm young again yeah now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the New Age and all that stuff isn't that the truth it's funny in fact it's interesting to me that so many of the songs now i grew up in the late fifties and early sixties and so much of the music that was popular at that time has come back uh-huh and you you don't hear everything all the time but you hear much of the same music perhaps a new version of it but it's the same stuff right um which is always kind of funny um and i remember my older sister i have a sister who's sixteen years older and at the time that i was a teenager late teenager i guess i can't remember the year Smoke Gets In Your Eyes became popular i think it was done by maybe the Platters or something uh-huh then and she laughed and she said well you know when i was a teenager that had been you know some years before she said that was a version of you know a song then and she said it's very similar but they've changed a little bit she said i like the original version better well they did it again about two or three years ago and i laughed again i said oh no here we are crops up every so often i listen to um the Christian radio station when i'm in the car K L T Y right right it does indeed uh-huh i like to listen to some of that music yes now that there there's some wonderful Christian music when you can find good stations uh the problem problem that i found um in this area is that the yeah there there is inconsistency in the quality uh-huh here if you get someone who's very good at selecting it's okay but sometimes they kind of get on a a a binge and they play the same sort of thing over and over again without really necessarily quality yeah where do you live uh i live in the uh Washington DC area Rockville Maryland i thought maybe you lived in Dallas because that's the complaint i make to my husband about the radio station too i said oh they're playing one of their ten songs it seems like every week they pick ten and they just play them over and over yeah and it uh-huh and i i you know there's so much available that i don't understand why they do that but um yeah yeah now my children have have sometimes um well they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come for our youth group at our church and um and uh-huh they when they buy a tape or something sometimes that's fun because it's different and something i've not always heard and you know i enjoy that right my husband likes uh Sandy Patty songs he likes to sing those in church he'd buy all the sound tracks he could get his hands on if he had the money to oh wow yeah that's nice so is your husband a singer well just an amateur singer He sings in the choir and he likes to do special music and stuff at church right yeah well that's a good thing to do yeah yeah i like to hear him sing he does a good job that's nice uh well do you have children no not yet we're expecting a baby in July well wonderful that'll be a musician i guess we'll start listening yeah maybe so we'll start listening to children's music oh there's some wonderful Christian uh children's tapes yeah there are you can uh you can get and i know when my children were younger um we found a lot of really nice tapes that they that they liked um there was an Agape music group and um i some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really um very memorable even though my children are now my youngest is almost sixteen but i still find some of the same tapes i uh some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy uh-huh oh uh uh-huh um there's one that's um a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect uh-huh and uh she's playing the piano and so she she gets the wrong note every now and then but then she keeps repeating it practice makes perfect and then you know talking about that so far as Christian life too and it's really cute oh yeah that sounds really cute yeah uh i tell my husband to sing to my stomach because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb and i said then when when it's born you can hold it and sing that again and maybe it'll comfort her you know when she's fussy and stuff yeah right yeah well do you know something because i have always played classical music what uh or classical style it's not always classical as you know the official uh word might go but um even when i was pregnant of course i listened to that and when our first child was you know an infant um of course i when i was around the house i played that music too uh-huh when he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale the music scale huh someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that's true and it was somewhat melodio us in other words it wasn't just you know it was really funny how strange uh-huh babbly i'll say that is well we'll have to keep up with that then right right i do think there is probably an influence there because i noticed that even though popular music the the wilder stuff was around when my uh older children were were you know adolescents early adolescents when they first start listening to music on their own they first get ask for a radio of their own and so on um uh-huh this same child um really listened to to more um ballady or um pleasant sort of songs rather than and even classical rather than the real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to huh and i i never i didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore right yeah have something to rebel against right but uh but i must say they all kind of like a variety of music which is nice i like that yeah that's good yeah variety is good yeah well i guess that covers it It was real good talking to you well it was nice talking to you and good luck with the baby um well thanks bye bye-bye  okay well uh so what do you think about golfing are you a spectator or a player oh i'm definitely a player i guess uh there is some question about that when i total up the score but yeah i know how you feel about that that's true what's what's uh what's the best part of your game do you think oh i like to uh i think putting is probably my uh forte um-hum what is your worst then i guess i have the most trouble with chipping how about you well i think i think my best part actually is chipping or at least it was last year i haven't been out this year it's kind of been uh kind of strange i hadn't been able to get out yet but uh my biggest problem is staying in the fairway for you know with drives and stuff um yeah i used to have a lot of trouble with that with a wicked slide and so forth but i think i've overcome a good deal of that um-hum yeah i've i've gone in the past years from uh having a wicked slice to having a wicked hook to back to having a wicked slice i mean it's just uh and i can't seem to find the middle space you know but i've got a friend of mine working on it uh i've trying to help me out i've been going to the driving range with him and and it seems to be doing some um yeah i've always threatened to take lessons but i've never gotten around to it yeah well lessons are are okay if you do it right i think i did i took some lessons uh a couple of years back but to tell you the truth that for a while hurt more than it helped because i it turned out that i couldn't do anything right after that oh really um and even you know like i said my chipping which is one of the best things in my game i couldn't do that i couldn't couldn't drive couldn't you know in in fact it was it wasn't as much at that point that i was hooking and slicing i just i was topping the ball i was you know i was doing a lot of things wrong at that point but i was trying to think of so many different things at the same time because you know it was it it's kind of a funny story whenever i went for for my first lesson the uh the instructor takes me out there and he says all right well take a swing and let me see how you look so he's he's bending down on one knee right so i take a swing and and all of a sudden his head just goes down and and then all of a you know he just kind of slowly brings his head up and looks at me and he says we've got a lot of work to do so built that confidence right up there huh oh yeah i was feeling real good then so he broke me down from i mean he started me from the very beginning as far as changing just about everything i did and uh uh that can be bad i mean you know a lot of people say well that's like i said it's best to take your lessons right at the beginning before you learn the bad habits i guess oh yeah oh that's definitely true in fact if uh if i ever you know have a son or anything i'm definitely going to uh you know teach him have a lesson or something is that yours or mine i think that's mine let me just quick catch it and i'll be back all right i'm back okay yeah uh they uh my uh i have an interesting anecdote what's that my uh my uh son who goes up to A&M he's had the pleasure of having a hole in one oh yeah yeah well uh you know the only person i've ever known that had a hole in one was my brother-in-law but uh and he he said he got his luckily so i don't know that's that's but i mean yeah well i guess there's a certain amount of luck in any hole in one i came so close once just once i mean that's the only time i've ever been any anywhere near but i mean i it was i used to live out in Midland Texas i don't know if you've ever been out there but it's you know a real windy place oh thank God i've never been to Midland but uh yeah i i played on a course out there and like i said it's a very windy place so it's you know the wind was blowing and it was cold and it was like it was about a hundred and i don't know a hundred and seventy or a hundred and eighty year par three and i you know the wind was right in my face so i just pulled out a seven wood right and i put that thing i mean it rolled right by the cup and only ended up three inches off but you know over over past the hole but i mean that's as close as i've ever been you know because i'm not you know that's one of my problems is controlling my my my irons on a par three so i have a lot of trouble hitting the greens yeah so do you do you like watching it though i mean well one of my uh well control and uh and contact are a big problem and they still are this one of the things i was doing wrong was too much back swing and hurrying my back swing yeah well that's that's exactly what my friend has has figured out that i do is my i can actually see the club on my backswing and and uh yeah and he says that what i do is i'm actually crossing the plain is what this is his words his technical words for it crossing yeah that sounds like the exact same words my friend tells me yeah because it because i ended up into an inverted C where the weight was on the wrong foot or something so yeah i i've found that i actually do of uh i get a lot uh better control and distance if i don't you know don't take as big a back swing yeah if i can convince myself not to try and kill it i sure you always get a lot better results yeah what's funny is the idea that uh you know what i consider you know like a three-quarter backswing or even a half backswing uh my friend says that's you know that's a full backswing and you don't want to go any further than that so i mean it's a now it's a matter of trying to convince myself that that's right yeah so i don't know it's going to be interesting well you have to prove it to yourself just by doing it a few times um that's probably true well it's a frustrating game golf oh isn't it though i don't know why i do it it's getting more expensive unfortunately too oh that's that's one of the worse things about it it really is but uh you know like you i haven't played any or not much this year i played a couple of times but um-hum i went out skiing in February and took uh little tumble down the slopes and so i'm nursing a wounded wing right you know that's it you have to be healthy too that's another point i guess yeah well i think that's about it yeah well i love the game so uh i enjoyed talking about it yeah i do too yeah well you take care yeah good luck okay enjoyed it bye-bye bye  okay if you want to go first go ahead oh i think i think that the um woman's role has come a long way we've gone more into the business aspect of uh like i say of i don't know working more and then and we i think we've even gone into more of the labor aspect of it also yes definitely uh with the pay and everything you know well i feel that uh i we've missed as far as the top jobs go you know the the higher echelon yeah uh-huh because if you look at most corporations there isn't a woman you know that's on the board of directors or that type of thing they're mostly all men there there may be a few but very incidental and uh i i really think that it'll be a long time probably before we see that um-hum yeah in one sense um i'm i'm an older person in my fifties so i feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today uh-huh you know that that they're not in the home by choice anymore um-hum it's most of the time you know even even if you want to say home you can't you really can't oh and a lot of times you can't yeah it's it's it's you you know it's it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living and i don't think raises have kept up with you know a lot of the stuff uh you know as far as your medical insurance and uh just groceries and gasoline and all this you know um-hum so i think that we we did come a long way in the sense that we have we're allowed to vote in you know like you say we're out in the labor force but i think we've lost something too yeah my mom um she's a housewife and well there's twelve kids in my family so my mom never could really work you know because she was kind of pregnant from day one she never really had a chance to work oh God love her yeah uh she worked before she got married but um she um she doesn't believe in she's very old fashioned she doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to that's what i mean and and you know there's a lot of truth to that if you're not going to have a family then that's fine then you you know a career is is a smart choice and i think it's great yeah um-hum but if you you have a family i think you owe the family a responsibility um-hum and to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff you know um-hum uh i think that both the mother and the child lose and i think that's why there's so many problems you know with kids today because they don't have the family roots anymore yeah you know i'm not saying that that it's totally gone but it's nothing like what it used to be yeah uh-huh you know in that sense yeah um and also like my mom my mom thinks and i mean she she's kind of right with it when both um partners of of the marriage work she feels that that's taking more away from that's that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work oh definitely you know like for for the men that don't have jobs if you know she feels that if those women weren't out there just because they want to do it she said that you know they could stay at home and with yeah that's right they don't want to take care of the kids and the house and that kind of thing that's very true but then they shouldn't have a family um-hum yeah that's what i'm saying you know i i think it's great that women have a choice today um-hum that there are ways to prevent families you know like those basically there's contraceptives and all kinds of ways to prevent pregnancies there's no need to have children if you don't want them yeah well what what do you think about that do you think that um what do what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business that's fine that that's the freedom of choice and i i agree with that because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent i uh-huh uh-huh uh well i shouldn't say they're not going to be a good parent they won't be a caring parent like they won't have that uh um-hum or they won't be as good as they could be right that's that's what i mean it they'll feel like it's uh a job um-hum it's it's not like something that they really wanted like i had three children and i mean i i i wanted every one of them um-hum i'm not sorry i had any of them and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them yeah you know i had to work but i tried to make it as painless as possible uh-huh in fact at one time i worked as a second shift and uh uh one Saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table and the kids were talking daddy this daddy that daddy this daddy that and i was sitting there it was like i didn't belong anymore and it was because i had worked for about nine months and when they were coming home i was going to work uh-huh and i wasn't there at supper time or bed time or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they'd be coming in the door i'd be going out exactly so we were i i felt i was losing my family uh-huh and that's why i said that's it i either have to quit or you know try something else so i went on third shift um-hum and i worked that shift for eleven years oh my yeah Bless you yeah just so that my kids would would have me at home uh-huh you know and i feel that's very important it really is and it's too bad because because mothers miss out on so much too so i mean in the sense that we've come a long way yes but we've sacrificed a lot to get there um-hum yeah i i agree and uh i really think that if uh like after second World War when women went to work in factories and all that that was like out of necessity because the men weren't here anymore uh-huh but then it got to be a point where they got some independence and they just enjoyed the income the extra exactly a man can afford the necessities a woman affords the luxuries um-hum and i notice today's uh kids you know like we had apartments before we had homes um-hum and we had to walk before we had a car exactly and now kids at sixteen years old they have their birthday what what do they get they get a car oh i know and uh it to me it's like we've lost our values in this country uh-huh we really have and i i'm not trying to be uh you know a prude or old fashioned or anything but i i don't think if you unless you earn something and you've worked for it and you have a sense of pride about it because while i did this in uh you know no one gave it to me um-hum you'll take better care of that and you'll prize that possession more than someone handing something to you exactly um-hum and it's just like college too i think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine but i don't think you should pay the whole way see yeah see now um my parents there's no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college and um of course so far there's only two of us that have gone and my older brother has paid his entire way and i'm on my i have six weeks left for and i'll you know i'll graduate and i paid my entire way and that's the way it'll go down the line and yeah like we i don't have a car because i'm paying for college and if i want a car my parents always said if we wanted a car we paid for the car and we paid for our own insurance and and i think that's right because sure but i'll bet your values are a lot higher you know your your and your self esteem and the way the way you uh you know think about things is probably a lot more common sense um-hum yeah than these kids that don't have that responsibility um-hum like i've had my you know like um like i know kids up here that have their own cars their money's just given to them like they still get their allowance they're twenty years old and they still get an allowance you that that well i've held a summer job since i you know i was in the eleventh grade sure yeah and i have had to take care of my own money i have my own checking account i pay for my own life insurance and i know a lot of kids that don't even know what i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor you know sure they probably don't even have any well if they do they don't know of it you know or yeah exactly and that's what i say you'll you'll be you'll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it's because you've been there uh-huh and no one can tell anyone anything anything you know you're going to find out for yourself but i mean i don't think you should just not listen to advice even if you don't take it just listen oh i know uh-huh you know there's there's no harm in that whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid you know just attention you know uh-huh but really uh what what do you feel the changes in the future like with the abortions and that type of thing women in politics and um president someday maybe actually i think abortion's going to take a turn where there's not going to be as many because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think yeah yeah i i really i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives and with the abortion it i i don't think there's going to be many abortions but i don't know what women will do when they get into politics you know about abortion yeah yeah i think it'll be freedom of choice well i i still think people have a choice i you know if you can live with it and it's not you know your conscience is clear uh-huh then i mean all all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i don't know i mean no one's said for sure you know exactly yeah um-hum yeah but uh i think if a woman would get into politics or enough women get into politics i definitely i think it'll definitely be freedom of choice yes yes um-hum which i mean i think it should be anyway i i do i'm Catholic and i we we're not supposed to you know say that that's okay but i really feel that it's freedom of choice no yeah because i mean you as an individual what you would do that that to me is your business i do um-hum and uh and and different circumstances call for different things exactly exactly that's  okay um do you have a credit card oh who doesn't have credit cards i know i've got one um i i did have two and the i found that um it just made me spend a little more so when i paid one of them off i got rid of it now i have two only have one yeah um i don't know i always used to be the person that would put something on and pay the bill right out yeah and now i've after every Christmas it seems the last few Christmases i used it for Christmas and i'm still paying it off oh i know it's it's Christmas is the worst time for i just have to leave them at home uh because the impulse buying is just terrible i don't know i consider myself pretty good but sometimes i can go out and i can i can over overspend my budget i guess i can afford it but it is it's a pain paying it off oh yeah uh-huh i i don't i don't know um i had uh i have seven hundred dollars in mine now and i've put saved up enough money where i'm going to bring it down to two hundred and hopefully i can keep it around there oh yeah oh that's good that's really good yeah i know a lot of people have i mean fifteen hundred dollars two thousand dollars oh i know i know but um i don't know i never i never liked loans a lot so i'm not a heavy credit card user i have a girl friend that she probably has two thousand dollars on couple credit cards so no oh i i i know i know people that are just uh uh uh uh are addicted to their credit cards and they've just gotten themselves so much in trouble financially with with them it's it it's just unreal i guess i guess i know it's easy to do especially if you if you have a job where you have to buy nice clothes and things oh yeah it it i think that is the biggest problem when you really not you don't don't really need the stuff but the nicer looking clothes are the more expensive nicely tailored clothes oh of course even though you could probably get away with a cotton dress you got to go out and buy the rayon dress or something you know you got to be they say you have to dress for success yeah plus uh uh when you get uh uh credit card companies send you things in the mail all the time you know uh get please get get get and you're already preapproved and all this other kind of stuff yeah you know they just try to uh to to get you to get uh have their credit card and um um uh uh six half a dozen isn't enough how many credit cards do you have oh i have one we uh we have one one Master Card that's pretty good yeah my oh my husband won't even put his name on it i don't believe in those and it's like but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car you know he believed in it yeah because you've got to have a credit card to rent a car yes you do uh-huh yes you do yes you do and that that uh down here you have to have a credit uh you just can't live without it because down here they don't take a check unless you got credit card and driver's license identification yep that's right up here at some stores if it's if you're not in your home town you have to show them a credit card yeah uh it's it's just a another form of identification you know just to well actually if your check bounces i guess they could legally take it off your credit card if that's why they're taking it i mean i don't know how fair that is uh oh yeah they can yeah but i don't know um yeah i guess that percentage rates are like eighteen percent well uh uh ours is ours is through our our credit union and it's thirteen so it's yeah thirteen that's not bad that's not that's really good compared to eighteen and twenty one which some of them are uh uh some of them are really extreme high yeah it's it's uh and yeah then you have to pay your fee and American Express you're really it's not a credit card because you have to pay it off at the end of the month but the fee for that it's really expensive isn't it yeah is it i i don't know we don't uh we don't i've never had one my husband has one for to for uh for business it's a company card but he's never had to use it so we don't get any get any get anything uh for it oh that's good i mean we would if we used it we would get it and then uh the company would reimburse any company expenses on it but so far he's never had to use it so we don't know anything about the billing yeah if he they they they have you pay it right out every month do they uh uh ooh yeah because it's uh that could get you in awful lot of trouble i know especially if your uh your reimbursement didn't come through yeah from your company because i know they i don't know why but you can use American Express and they give you an itemized bill and yeah you can use that i don't know why you can't use other credit cards for business that way i i don't i don't know i think it's uh just a lot of companies prefer American American Express yeah i i don't know if it's easy for them to get or or or what but um uh but i guess it's it's run so much different from the other ones yep this is this is it actually kind a boring subject in credit cards hum you really you just know some people abuse them but not a joke about the person who pays their Master Card off with their Visa yeah i bet you there i bet you there are people that do that oh i i i'm sure there are i mean uh you go get a cash advance on one credit card to pay the other you take oh gee oh gee oh gee they i think they charge more for cash advances so do they um it's it's some cards you you can do that and some cards you can't down here i think it just depends on what the banks will take plus well it yeah you can't get cash advances oh so on on uh on some cards oh uh-huh well i saying through my bank they they since they have their own card they don't like to give advances through other for other cards oh well no uh it i think that's a really bad plan in your budgeting if you have to pay one card off with another oh eventually eventually that that doesn't solve anything no it doesn't that just be solid for a couple of weeks then you get both bills back yeah because it's still there it's just some place else now i know i don't credit cards almost seem unfair to a person who's who's got a victim of impulse buying oh yeah store credit cards like unfair advertising or something store credit cards are even higher interest rate than say Master Card or Visa because i had a Neiman Marcus card for a while and i used it once and then i cut up because the interest rate was like almost twenty three percent oh wow so i i cut i cut that thing up so also when you give give someone a credit card like a normal credit card like a Visa or something uh-huh that that um business person loses four percent because i used to work in a business and we always and we used to lose four percent on the credit card orders oh really ooh yeah it's it's the thing if if a business is taking a credit card they're really they sacrificing something too it seems the credit card company makes money all the way around yeah i also was going to say they get it from both ends because it is a four percent that they take uh i didn't know three or four percent i don't know which put you in better rating yep because when i used to go to the bank wow i used to take it off the deposit oh how awful yeah you do have to take it off your deposit yeah so it is a a service that they're offering yeah oh boy those people are making money hand over fist i i know should own stock there instead of these uh uh banks going that are folding but but everybody's really trying to you know it's become a real national problem credit card debt and and i we've really cut i wonder how much is numbers how many billions of dollars it's got to be billions of dollars oh it it is it is it they uh uh you hear a lot about how much uh uh shaky the economy is just because of personal debt and what they're talking about is credit cards yeah that's uh probably true i mean you have the principal debt the car loan and your house loan yeah and then there's all the merchandise you buy on your credit cards uh-huh i don't know if they count uh mortgages as personal debt that's personal maybe they don't i don't i'm not sure that they do i think uh what they're talking about like is uh credit cards and other junk and loan car loans things like that yeah because uh boy i know people who kids people right out of college the credit card people like to get you because because they uh they spend they use the credit cards real easily and real freely and then they get in real trouble i know i had a girl friend she just got married out of college and the husband had taken confiscate her credit cards yeah i mean i don't know it's probably they're always saying the women are doing are the spending ones but i haven't heard one uh a single woman taking their credit card away from the man well i don't know i i definitely want to get mine up mine paid off month to month like i used to yeah and just as soon as i get it paid off i'll probably get laid off terrible can't afford my credit card anymore oh i know it you become a slave to your plastic  well we don't do much eating out oh well we wonder how these topics get chosen where was the last place you went out to eat uh Benny's well last place we went was uh uh oh we went to uh Popeye's uh Fried Chicken well actually it was a drive through yeah well uh ours usually consists of McDonald's i've got two young kids and they love McDonald's well our our kids are a little older actually we got a a seventeen year old and a and a fourteen year old but but we still wind up i still i like fast food reasonably well yeah well uh i know it put on some weight for us so we stayed away them or tried to but i love to take the kids they say uh what do you look for to bring them uh to look at to uh come back to yeah i was talking to my husband while i was listening to they was trying to find a call and uh i said it's the toy uh uh the play yard out in the front yard you know that McDonald's has well how old are your kids four and two oh so they really like that sort of stuff then yeah they they'd rather go out there and play in the yard than eat i can remember many times that when when it's interesting though that that you know particularly when you're traveling and you go some place you can stop at a McDonald's that's that's a big playground uh when the kids you know when the kids really need to get out and run around after been driving a while yeah well we've took a we was living out in Memphis and we used to drive back and forth to Louisville that's where we usually from Louisville Kentucky and uh you know we'd stop at the fast foods there uh usually i like to go just to get the kids out have them in a confined space where i can uh sit down and relax and be able to watch them too yeah that that that's really nice that they started doing that because it's the problem is you take them to some place nice and and you know the um even a place where they have to to sit down even if they really get kids they get they get bored in a hurry yeah and uh yeah you know we now that we're a little older we can go to i i still like um i like buffets yeah they got a couple all you can eat down here and uh we haven't went to them yet but i've been threatening my husband that we'll go yeah well have you been in the area very long no we've only well we've been in Texas for two years little a little under two years oh so uh not really i don't know it too well you say you in Denison oh okay so we were i was in Sherman um yes hum last month of the i took a i sponsored a youth group up there and uh it was funny we went to a uh oh we must have had thirty of us and we went into a Pizza Hut and you wander into a Pizza Hut with that kind of crowd and they sort of hate to see you coming so they're they get the business but with a crowd of people it's uh it it it was kind of funny and we went in first and then it was so crowded and we went and i'm trying to think it's right off anyway i don't know if it's Pizza Hut or Pizza Inn anyway we went to another one and and uh they the rates there are fairly reasonable but uh you know even those places are starting to have you know video games and things for kids to your kids play video games oh my son does he he's the four year old i've got a Nintendo that he plays with oh well that gives him something to amuse him while there uh yeah yeah well he likes those crane games you know where you try to win a toy yeah he likes every time we pass one he wants me to win him a toy well do you have do you have any like Chucky Cheese or trying to well i remember Chucky Cheeses was down in Lewisville uh i haven't seen one here well they got one um in Richardson probably me i try and think there there there's a couple of those that they combined and it's a combination pizza parlor and all kinds of in a game room and toy room yeah and yeah and and they have the room full of balls and yeah Show Biz Pizza yeah yeah Show Biz that's the name of it that's what it is Show Biz yeah uh well do you like the pizza at Show Biz yeah it's alright uh i haven't seen one down here i think where there was one in in Memphis when we was there oh uh and it was great Steven the only thing that Steven didn't like that's my son was uh you know they had those dancing bears and stuff it scared him to death yeah yeah well you know they're so large they animated it yeah i think that's what it was but uh he he'd rather go and ride on the rides you know they had airplanes that go up and down and stuff and yeah that's really uh yeah we were until the kids got older we'd go there and you know it was um that right i'll date myself a little bit but it's remarkable the number of those things they need merged or something but it still it's still quite popular i have to i'm not sure the pizza was okay i mean well we went one time uh one of my ex-boyfriends had taken me this was years and years ago and uh i'd taken my younger brother he's about twelve years younger than i am and uh um-hum i remember eating their pizza and they had put anchovies and all this on it i mean they piled it up um-hum and it was the nastiest tasting pizza i've ever tasted me i rather go Master Mister Gatti's or there's a Godfather's down in uh Memphis and that was a good pizza i've never tasted a better pizza well well well do you ever go out to any of the higher higher end type more expensive places uh no the last expensive place i went to it was a it was a Shoney's huh and we went there every Tuesday night and or Saturday night when we was playing uh when i was playing softball with uh hum a softball league down in Memphis we went and uh that's the most expensive place we went to um well we got a lot of barbecue places around around the Dallas area Spring Creek Barbecue that's right in Richardson and it uh i i like the barbecue there um and it it's fairly reasonable you can get um it i mean if if you know you go through the line and and pick up your food yeah well it's kind of hard to take two kids uh to a nice place number one they bug all the other people and uh or so we think they do and yeah it is they're probably just being normal though yeah but uh i don't know i every time i set up a baby sitter to uh go out and do something my husband uh nixes it and says we'll stay home this day and well when the you know it's funny when the when the when the kids get a lot older though you can you can you can do as you please our son graduates this year and we're kind of looking forward to yeah well i can't i'll you know i say i can't wait for my kids to grow up but i believe i'm going to miss this age when they're gone yeah yeah they're uh but i i do want my freedom back i'm sure my husband does too well the you know it's it's kind of like wanting to talk you know and um but and then they learned to say no and it's kind of funny but they uh the the and now they get older our son's a senior in high school will talk to us but he you know you know it's mostly um no it not really anything really important in his life no no no and it's sort of i guess it's a little disappointing but but i suppose it's it's just the way life is but yeah i i can't you know i can't relate to that just yet uh you know i mean my daughter she doesn't know the word yes it's no every time you turn around you know and my son i i can't de scribe him it's i don't know why or you know right uh can't relate to a seventeen year old yet well it it you know everybody all says you'd be surprised how quickly it comes but it it uh we moved here in seventy six and daughter was six weeks old and and hard to believe in nearly fifteen years uh you sound like you got a Louisiana accent no i i i grew up in uh in Alabama Alabama okay alright alright i guess close to the Louisiana border well no actually and i was until i was eight i lived in in in south uh western Georgia and then we moved over into central part of Alabama oh okay but i've been away from there for goodness i haven't lived in Alabama since nineteen sixty five that's been a long time ago i lived several places Europe and yeah in Asia yeah i spent military yeah my my husband was in the Navy but so i was in the Air Force what were you in Air Force uh i he tried to get in there they wouldn't take him yeah uh i was i went in in nineteen and sixty five when they were drafting people in fact my father was on the draft board so yeah well uh i i was born in sixty five so i can't say that uh husband was only five years old then too yeah well it things are different when uh everybody in in fact that it that was Vietnam era i was in fact i went to Vietnam myself yeah well uh it was it's it's a different world yeah well i know uh i don't just just out of curiosity how do you feel about these guys getting a welcome home that you all didn't get well see i never had a hard time coming home it didn't uh you know there all these people who spit on them and all these kinds of things i i came home and got married and i i never uh i and could now but i didn't and i mentioned that to my wife and she said well you never wore your uniform when you were off duty but i didn't uh i flew into Los Angeles um but i had um when i was in Vietnam but i by then when we landed actually went into Seattle Tacoma and i changed out of my uniform civilian clothes and and i never course i stayed in i stayed in the Air Force a number of years but i never had any problems um and all this the all the of course i wasn't in combat either um i was a staff weenie  all right okay well um we lived i grew up in San Antonio and i was used to the heat and i was used to what couldn't grow uh-huh down there and uh we had a small um farm house out in Castroville which is just uh to the west of San Antonio uh-huh and we did a lot of gardening out there and uh mostly in raised beds so we could keep the uh soil nice yeah because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil very hard to to grow very hard to cultivate and when we came up here uh to California uh we're in the Monterrey area and it's very uh nice sandy soil rich soil and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow how fine so we've been out here well really in the house since December and we've been uh planting flowers that we could never plant in San Antonio uh because the heat would just dry them up after you know about three good weeks of nice weather before the heat started um and here they are supposed to last year around so we have some really pretty flowers growing and uh we're at the edge of a forest area so there's a lot of pine mulch oh boy uh-huh uh just about anything you would want in Texas as a gardener is here just around us you know we got here at the end of about a four year drought uh we've had a whole lot of rain uh it's been raining pretty much continually now uh off and on maybe one day of break for about a month oh really so yeah we're getting replenished and so there is uh when i first came here everything was yellow the grass was dead everywhere and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous lush and green and beautiful and i hope that it holds out here after the summer hm wow but uh that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening and that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and uh and waiting for the the rain to subside so we can mow we after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend but um we're just so happy to see green it's just so nice we haven't really done too much else other than that hum well we um we just moved to our first home and we had lived in a condominium before so uh-huh we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties so we're just learning the ropes here and uh-huh but when we moved in um our backyard has so many big tall trees in it that there just there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard oh uh-huh so we're you know going talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things and learning about different kinds of grass we trying to go grow grass and it just seems so funny to me that when i grew up in Missouri and you didn't have to worry about growing grass there it just happened automatically uh-huh so do you have to get a shade tolerant grass is that what you're so yes we are we tried we planted some fescue last um fall uh-huh and it's it's really really pretty and um green it stayed pretty pretty green throughout the winter and uh and it's pretty good it's not as thick and as nice it doesn't look like it can withstand too much you know oh okay does that last through the summer too it's supposed to die off like in August and then you replant it in September um oh and uh so but we don't the Saint Augustine and all that supposedly was back there just wasn't like i say there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard uh-huh and um so mostly you know we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers and flower beds or even gardens that uh-huh we're just saying let's get some grass just get grass to grow i know let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much you know uh-huh well when we had our house um out in Castroville the problem with ours is that the uh plots there are a third of an acre and uh-huh trying to keep grass alive during a summer on a piece of ground that big was expensive oh yeah to water it and uh and eventually well especially when it was so bad last year well i guess it was the year before now uh it was so hot that year that was the year that i think it started out a hundred in February oh no um we were just watering all the time finally what we did was we said we're going to have to let the back yard die it's going to have to do whatever it's going to do because we can't really afford the front yard on its own uh-huh and so when we left you know the back yard had and the Saint um i think it was Saint Augustine that we had um it it had held onto a small portion but primarily once the weeds start in the back yeah we were just you know resigned to well the only way we were going to fix this one is that if you plow it all under and put everything back on top of it again uh-huh hum but i don't know that's the bad thing there is that we spent so much money or you would spend so much money trying to keep a large lawn alive that was the only thing i didn't like about lawns and we were sitting there wondering there must be a better way to landscape so that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and green and the weeds out yes and so it's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful lush green lawn and we never there was no such thing as watering your lawns in Missouri i mean it just happened uh-huh uh-huh and um so it's been real fun here to see there's a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies and a lot of people um we live in north of Dallas and um uh-huh Arlington area Plano okay Plano uh-huh uh-huh up north and um and so there's a lot of market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the Dallas area and big market for uh-huh for yards yard work yeah i imagine so well everybody it seems like everyone is so particular especially in the Dallas area there there's so much money and everyone can afford they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn and uh-huh another thing i've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes the area is so small that they take great pride in being able to use whatever lawn they do have to look really nice uh-huh yes they do i noticed that they're really putting in small back yards because they have these most of the houses have the alleys that run behind uh-huh and so that really cuts into your backyard space and yeah but we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much just right now we're just this is we just moved in in September so we're just still at the point where we're talking about the uh-huh the necessity right i know oh it's it's awful the first house well the our house in Castroville was the first one too and we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening would run into uh-huh and the time that it took especially when you start mowing and then when it comes to fertilize then it would come to raking and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water uh-huh and the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just that was the way to go if you could do it people that were building the new homes that put those in yeah that was that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient they would just turn it on and the timer would run and it would water their lawn and they didn't have to worry about it at all um and that was so nice but we didn't have that luxury so we were dragging the the sprinkler around everywhere and uh so i hope you can find uh i don't know what type of grass grows in uh the real shady areas i remember the guy that was on the radio um they had a gardener and he i don't know i had this one well i've still got the book it's um i think it's just called Texas Gardening and it talks about the different grasses to use for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas uh-huh hm we and but there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant but i don't remember what it is but it's got like a boot on the front of the book uh-huh it's just a real fancy decorated boot it's like Texas Gardening and it talks about you know different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it and it goes into the full gamut of gardening you know everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to uh how to prune but one of the things i do remember was when it talked about the grass and there being the shade tolerant types of grass and i think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used grass oh um but i don't remember i don't remember if it was Raleigh and Saint Augustine or or what but i do remember they had used a blend or what it was well we're going to have to do that because we have the shade the trees this is an established and older home that we moved into and um uh-huh the trees are just so tall and there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that like even if its raining you can go out in our back yard and not get wet oh but that's so neat because so many homes don't have that so you'll be cool all year around in the summer that's great well that's what we're looking forward to and that's what they say the payoff is but uh-huh it makes the biggest difference when you have the big old trees and the people that moved in next to us they built a new house on the empty lot and they just had their brand new little trees They didn't have any shade they any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day too hot yes so oh that's great that you have them are they oaks that around there well there are all different kinds there oh that's even better you know there are some oaks magnolias and like plum trees peach trees oh there are some big big tall oak trees one across uh-huh  where do you get most of your news i watch the MacNeil Lehrer news hour and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends where where are you oh yeah i'm in Dallas are you in Dallas also no i'm in San Antonio oh really okay um-hum i get my news from a combination of sources i take the the paper everyday and i read it on the way in to work on the in a carpool uh-huh and uh um-hum oh really and i watch the uh actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work and then you know usually over lunch there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news um-hum i normally find that uh i i'm probably the most um news hungry of my friends so i don't we don't normally talk about the news at lunch i i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend simply because i used to get it during the week um-hum but um i would always end up arriving at work late because i would always end up skimming the headlines spending too much time reading it in the morning oh yeah so i have to cut myself down to the weekend plus after work um the MacNeil Lehrer news hour is on public television and i enjoy that quite a bit um-hum yeah um one of the women that i work with her husband is Iranian um-hum so here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch i will admit i work with uh someone who's Iranian and he definitely has a very different slant on the news he's very very skeptical of the news media and i will admit i'm reasonably skeptical also um-hum but he's i don't know uh he's much much much more so It's sort of interesting though because he does bring a a much um different perspective with all the Gulf goings on um he was always speaking in terms of you know American imperialism reasserting itself and i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country um-hum well i i uh i like the print news much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize um-hum true um the i understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably doesn't they um tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time sort of like the uh what is that ABC's Nightline um-hum um-hum well i guess they only normally stick with just the one um story but they they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories they don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in in every little town no no it's very much national interest news a lot of times they end up um yeah with these panels of experts and they go back and forth where everyone's giving some opinions and sometimes that i i don't know the value of that because i saw plenty of jokes and and um oh editorial cartoons about all the retired generals making their living during the the Gulf War i've been getting a kick out of those lately um-hum although um i'm i'm only twenty five so i've never actually been through a period of war and i don't know anyone in the military and i don't have a lot of background knowledge in uh um-hum military strategy and and weaponry and and all that kind of stuff and i thought the generals were very interesting now when they started to speculate i i saw that for what it was and thought all of these guys don't know what's going on but i thought they were they they were interesting and and they shed some light on what was going on for me um-hum i will admit it's interesting i i i'm twenty six so i don't have any more experience in that than you um um-hum it it it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind you know there were some that were screaming for air power there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it and they seemed to mold the events um-hum to their view of the world which i suppose just about everyone does but these guys had a a uh national soap box to stand on and and express this view you know one of the the best television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on ABC and it was for children and it was hosted by Peter Jennings um-hum and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions and they they had all their correspondents in the different areas in Saudi Arabia and Israel and and all they had them all uh on i don't know what you'd call it other than on line they had them all on hold and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer they would cut to that person and that person would answer the question it was just very um-hum informative and interesting and uh i was real impressed at how ABC handled uh translating the war for children um-hum yeah i i didn't see anything like that although i did uh i guess one thing that i found sort of interesting this is getting a little off the topic but there was a a a big push you know with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with counselors um-hum to to help parents uh learn how to talk about their war with their children i thought that was a really unusual thing and our local HEB stores here i don't know if it's HEB statewide or whatever but they have videos that uh i don't know if they still have them but they were free rental videos that had something to do with the war um-hum it it with the children's aspect um-hum uh it was it was right it was something for children that that they they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and and uh getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it and that kind of thing um-hum i suppose that is a valuable service that again not having uh lived through another war i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of or if that was well a a new concern with people back during the Vietnam conflict that no one will will have the guts enough to call a real war uh um-hum the that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal that's true that's true so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news and probably more importantly one that lasted short enough that that people's interest didn't flauge too badly yeah i tell you what the first three days i was glued to the television i will admit the same thing i would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer and they would run these extended two three hour versions of the program and i i was just i was and i had yeah horrified and fascinated by what i was seeing i tell you what the uh the war started let's see was it a Wednesday or Thursday must have been Thursday um and Friday night i was i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning sitting right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open um-hum because i was watching CNN and they would they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus and the people would be standing there in gas masks and you'd be hearing the sirens and it was just i was amazed um-hum i i didn't have that exper ience i i don't have cable so i i'm pretty much limited to PBS which i thought i thought they did a very good job oh um-hum um i've got one question for you i you say you take the newspaper uh-huh um i i found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting we've got the one fairly well relatively weaker paper the Times Herald and then the Morning News which has a very strong subscription um-hum does San Antonio have you said San Antonio right um-hum do you have just one paper or do you have several no there are two and they're pretty close uh the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper i grew up near Houston and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck um-hum and the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up i mean the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff i mean it's it's um-hum piddley stuff to pick a newspaper over and i enjoy the comics are better in this newspaper like this newspaper has The Far Side and the comics that i enjoy and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of so um-hum i i actually take both newspapers on the weekends i figure i'm only taking on the weekend and i can afford that i i find the news reporting in the the yeah Mourning News to be better but i sort of have a liberal political slant and the Mourning News just has an incredibly conservative editorial um outlook and my fiancee i get the Times Herald just to balance that out a little bit my fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers He takes both San Antonio papers an Austin paper both Houston papers i guess he takes seven the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper but he's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University so he's getting all the sports sections um-hum and so you know he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread unless  well what kind of pets do you have at the present time we have none we intend to purchase a pup in two months are you you're married yes and newly married no we've got uh we've been married forever about eight years eight years two kids that was just oh sounds like us only we started off ours with we had we had pets before we had kids that's why i thought when you were saying you know we're going to have one in two months or something perhaps that you were newly married no we've uh my we we've got a five year old but we've had one pet since we've had her but uh he didn't quite work out hm so um we are we've been now petless for a couple of years and yeah we're going to get another one this summer we're we've a got a vacation planned and we want to wait until we get back from the vacation before we yes that's easier bring a puppy in are you going to get a dog yeah yeah that's what that's what we have is two dogs what type big dogs well our first at first they were our child substitutes before we had our children and we got one right after we got married we both decided we needed a dog we went to the pound and we got this mutt uh-huh and he's been it was alright before we had our kids it was he's just he's a real hyper dog he barks and and jumps a lot so we had him for a year and then my husband decided after we had him a year that he'd wanted for his entire life to have a Siberian husky goodness and i think why didn't you tell me a year ago when we got the other dog you know this was your dream of your life to have a Siberian husky so we got the other one for him and to keep the first one company when we were at work all day right so we have the the old the older dog's a male and he's he weighs about forty pounds and then Pepper is a year younger and she weighs about seventy pounds yeah they're big dogs so we have two massive dogs go through lots of dog food yeah Are they primarily outdoor dogs absolutely yeah i never wanted my husband wanted indoor dogs because he'd grown up with them but i can't stand it indoors i don't they shed and you know the mud and and the scratches and the smell and the uh wherever yeah oh yeah there for me dogs are meant to be outside i firmly believe that large dogs are meant to be outside we had Danes when i was a child and um goodness and we had our Danes in the house oh my goodness but i mean it's almost dangerous to have them in the house sure they're going to run you down and uh we went through a time period that we had three Danes goodness and all of them were in the house we had yeah and we had we had had a litter and she had uh had thirteen puppies hm eight of which survived and uh and she we ended up keeping one of those puppies i see we had the mom the dad and one of the puppies and it was horrendous yeah hm we wound up getting uh getting rid of the mom selling the puppy and just keeping the dad because dad was the favorite one anyway okay oh when i was growing up my folks we had fox terriers which are little bitty yeah they weigh about ten pounds yeah and so we had we had one for a long time and then oh gosh when i was about ten or eleven i guess my parents decided that dogs would be a good way to teach reproduction so then they went out and got a female uh-huh and then we started having puppies and she had she had four or five litters she always had to look we always kept them in the house when they had the when she when the babies were little right and the rest of the time they were outside they had we had a big uh kind of a play house and part of that was their dog house it was kind of cordoned off uh-huh so they had a place to stay out there and then they had the yard and they had a little run that uh they kept them in when we were trying to do stuff in the back yard and didn't want them out but we had the same kind of situation at one point in time we had the mother the one of her last her next to last litter we kept we had one one we never could get rid of he was a real dumb dog nobody wanted him the puppy was just one of these dogs just as dumb as a stick and we have him and then our female she had another litter we didn't think she was we thought she was too old to get pregnant again turned out she wasn't and uh she had her litter i guess her last litter had like four and two of them survived and then she didn't make it oh two days after the they were born she had a she died she had some kind of an infection from it all she was just too old we had to feed the puppies we had to get up night and day with those just like with a baby yeah and bottle feed them and we just we had a Schnauzer that got milk fever right after the babies were born and we had to feed all their babies feed all the babies there were five and there were four of them that survived oh um yeah weren't they messy too well did she did the mother survive yeah she did survive so you could still feed it but she kept them clean no oh she didn't she didn't do something no she didn't even she did not even take the sack this is the laziest dog that ever lived um when she had these puppies she crawled up onto my mother's stomach in the middle of the bed had the puppies and woke up my mother oh no to cut the sacks off she didn't even lick the sacks off laziest dog on earth she never she never nursed them she never cleaned them she never did anything to them they were like she they didn't exist yuck oh goodness what's a mess that was like oh boy they are so messy when they're little too yeah we were giving them a bath about every other day boy we were giving them a bath at least once a day but they were so horrible yeah because they would roll and everything and oh yeah they just poop and it's yeah they yeah and crawl through it yeah oh i guess i had fish for a while when i was a kid too i had a fish tank and i had a few until like a nice aquarium well it wasn't really an aquarium it was an old you know how you used to have these um this was a box and it was originally it was made like an aquarium i guess except it was smaller but it was its original use was to put in the refrigerator on the shelf had a little spigot at one end oh yeah and you could get water out of it you know keep cold water yeah we outgrew the need for that and so i used it for an aquarium that's great it worked except the fish could swim it wasn't tall enough i kept the if i didn't keep the lid on it the fish would uh swim out and flop on the floor sometimes flip out of the thing but the cat was always happy yeah those have been i mean and our dogs now our dogs with our kids i have two little kids three and a half and one and a half uh-huh so we built the dog run down the length of our uh back yard because the kids were getting i mean we couldn't even let our older son until he was about two i guess he was two when we built the dog run we couldn't let him go out in the back yard because it was we have a deck with a rail and he could go on that but the dogs were so big and he was so little you know they just even walking by him they'd knock him down and the whole back yard had poop in it all the time uh-huh it was a mess for the little one so yeah yeah now we have a back yard and a dog run uh we've uh we'll probably get real small Cairn terrier oh that'll be nice and it'll probably be an indoor outdoor dog yeah back and forth uh but see my my oldest is five and a half and so she can take part in some of the uh responsibilities a three and a half year old really can't quite take part of many of the responsibilities maybe feeding them three and a half yeah or probably he or she is old enough to where they won't tease it too you know poke on it too much oh she's got respect for animals thank goodness yeah because that's hard ours our kids have gotten over it with the dogs behind it they have the run it's kind of like a wire run uh-huh so they go the first thing they do is they go out there and play with them but boy the little one still he just wants to poke my older one our older son's pretty good about it he'll pet the dog you know yeah and and he's three and a half like you're saying and he he's pretty good with them and with other people's dogs and cats that he runs into but boy the little one still just wants to poke and and see if the dog will back off you know and i think that's eighteen months yeah i mean i think that's just kids trying to figure out you know what's going to happen and it will happen again and again and again yeah i think it is too it's gonna get better yeah yeah i think if we didn't have pets if we didn't already have our dog and cat now we wouldn't get them because the kids are so little yeah i think when they're really little like the eighteen month old it's not fair to the animal because the kids are so miserable to them if they're out very much yeah yeah it has to be a real mellow kind of animal that can yeah that's uh survive it and child yeah and not get mad at the kid that's the other thing too that i i always felt Pepper the Siberian husky is really sweet she can i think the kids could walk up and they could literally probably stand on her back and she wouldn't even she'd kind of look at them like what are you doing now she's real good natured about it well that's what you i mean that's what you need in a pet if your going to have small children too yeah but we uh well i think that's about all my pet stories right now so oh wonderful i'm just flat out of pet stories i don't even have a pet anymore okay well it's been nice talking to you well thanks thanks for calling bye-bye okay bye-bye  okay um i guess um this is probably really a good subject for me because i really like to do uh hand work uh mostly i do needlepoint i guess oh really what kinds of things have you done but um um well i've made a lot of baby gifts it seem like that's like especially lately there's been so many babies that uh bibs and blankets and things like that wall hangings aha um do you ever keep any of your stuff isn't that funny no i do crochet and a lot of uh things like that and i have very little of my own stuff and it's kind of embarrassing people say let me see some of your work oh well can you go to so and so's house yeah isn't that funny i guess i do have one thing friend of mine gave me a clock kit and i i needlepointed the face yes ooh and i uh kept that because she gave me that so that that would be definitely something you'd want to keep was was the whole face done or just the numbers and and like minute oh yeah and it's real neat marks um basically the whole well no i guess the minute marks but the minute marks are done they're like hearts oh and then the at the numbers they they're kind of outlined and stuff it it was quite bit of work but you know it was a lot of fun too i really like doing stuff like that so i did some needlepoint years ago and then i got into the Bargello oh what's that well it's an Italian um needlework using using the uh i started to say the canvas but the uh hum the what kind of cloth uses that i i've just gone blank but it's used with yarn and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth huh and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever and it was used quite often in the colonial times to uh uh to upholster chairs and so forth as well as the crewel um embroidery work that was done on them wow that's interesting what did you what kind of things did you do what i did when i was doing that was mostly pillows you know for sofas and so forth and uh-huh i can't find one that i've done it it's one of those things i didn't i didn't give them away but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves oh yeah or or what and it i was so proud of them when i got them finished but i have no idea where they are what did you call that bargello it's B A R G E double L O huh that's i've never heard of that before i've probably seen it though i mean when you described it i suspect you i suspect you have yeah i mean when you described it it sounded like something you know that would be around i guess but i've never heard of it before and it's really interesting um i guess i've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past but i've kind of gotten out of that i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows me too yeah that's interesting really that's yeah it is how did you know to choose this subject tonight that's funny uh how did you what kinds of decorations did you use with the baskets how were you decorating the baskets oh basically bows and lace uh ribbons um i really wanted to do you know so many of them now have the ribbons where i'm not sure how they do it but the ribbons um they make them they like i don't know how to explain it they make them hard you know like fabric that's been stiffened in yes yeah i've never done that and those are so neat i mean i would really like to do those but i've seen some and there there they i suspect they're fairly simple because the one lady i've seen i know that does it i've never asked her any questions but she has three kids all under the age of like six um and and they're all a handful so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly oh definitely yeah when i do um crochet it's usually the lacy Victorian type oh things like that and i stiffen those with a a glue mixture it's like white glue and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then allowed to dry in those those draping bows i mean those draping streamers i don't know i was just there's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar that's not going to melt too much with uh oh yeah uh high humidity that's i think that's what my concern was was it really sure and how they would how they would last in in a room do you know what my concern is how will i dust this thing i'm terrible you're right no that's true that's funny so many of my crafts well right now i'm looking at a little uh quilted uh uh hanging it's like it's a flag and i don't want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth but it's such a dust collector to be yeah out and so forth and most of my things are dust collectors uh and i hate to dust so first thing i think of is how easy would this thing be to clean oh i know that's funny no i just um i have really gotten out of it i don't do it quite as much as i used to um i guess because i i went back to school so i don't have as much time oh you don't have time now and i have two children also so that it keeps me very busy but i really enjoy it when i do do it when i get the chance you know it's really you definitely don't have time it's so relaxing to just sit and but once i get started i can't put it down i just that i have a similar problem i've got to have time or i don't even want to get into it in the first place uh-huh uh-huh and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all i know i started a project it's been over a year ago that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for Christmas and i you just didn't say which Christmas right that's what i keep telling this person well i didn't tell you what year what was this project um well it's a it's uh cross stitch and it's a picture and it's a wildlife it has deer and trees and it's really beautiful but it's going to be a lot of work and you know i've i have worked on it quite a bit but not as much as i'd like to you know it's just so hard now this is done in the needlepoint uh-huh well i shouldn't it's counted cross stitch actually is what i'm doing and so it's really since it's counted you know it's really a lot of work yep yes yes i do know i have done a little bit of that but i've decided that that's something that demands my time my my total attention uh-huh and so i've got to have total almost total silence i can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate it sounds like you'd have lots of shading on that particular piece it is not does not sound like an easy one to finish uh-huh yep no it really isn't and i tell you really i could just kick myself for even starting it because i have a feeling i'm never going to get it done i'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life oh i'm sure you'll get it done but it just may not of the original obviously not of the original time schedule no that's true i i just don't know when i'm ever it just seems like there's just never enough time to pick it up and do it you know it's just really hard but i really do en like i said i really enjoy it when i do it's just hard just hard finding the time that can be dedicated to that uh-huh and there's there's so many other things that i i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts i've made a lot of bibs and wall hangings and so you know those don't take much time at all so it's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them do you do you use patterns i mean like a book of patterns or do you go out an buy a a kit like for a bib or something like that no no i usually just buy a pattern book i have several pattern books and i just go with those okay and then i buy the bibs separate usually i think it's a little bit cheaper in the long run and then i just use whatever colors i want to i don't usually use the colors they tell me to and it it depends on what it is you know but some things especially letters um if they suggest certain colors for letters i just go with whatever i want to yeah i yeah that's what i would do too yeah or whatever i have that's there's yeah there's a few designs i guess i've done myself but not very many real simple ones you know i do i've made i made a little uh little uh little thumb print and made it a bunny ooh it was really easy i mean just just did a thumb print you know what what with ink oh okay uh-huh and then see i didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print you know that was just the ink and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth that was so simple and it just it didn't take anything at all oh that sounds really neat did you do did you use like a stamp pad an ink okay so you just uh-huh just like being finger printed and then i just  have you had any uh major uh car repairs done recently well as a matter of fact i just got rid of a car because of the requirement to do some major repairs uh-huh um i had a Ford Escort with about ninety five thousand miles on it and the engine was shot um i i think the problem was uh the head gasket needed to be replaced and um but nobody would do just the head gasket everybody wanted to overhaul the engine entirely so you're saying that the repairs would have cost more than the car was worth right and um um i did get the water pump was shot at the same time so i got the water pump fixed just to carry me over until i could sell the car um which i which surprisingly the car was in great demand um in fact i had a bunch of people come to look at it and they were fighting over how much they were going to pay me for this piece of junk i was amazed i think any car that runs right now is in demand i guess so um but i ended up buying a um a used car to replace it i got a uh eighty five Dodge Aries which only had thirty four thousand miles on it and uh speaking of repair problems um this car has a has an interesting problem that nobody seems to be able to fix do do you fix cars uh i work on my own i've got an nineteen eighty Trans Am that i've had uh since it was new wow and i've had very good luck with it uh haven't had many repairs done at all the alternator went out four years ago and uh the i had to replace the water pump back in nineteen eighty three but uh other than a few transmission leaks that i got repaired uh i really haven't had anything but uh regular maintenance yeah but do you do anything yourself i mean yeah i change the oil and i do the lubrication yeah okay but if any major problems say like uh transmission leaks i took it in for that right and i had to have an alignment done last year so i had that done yeah yeah i don't think that's the kind of thing you can do yourself is it unless you had the equipment uh not really it's not too easy i had past uh state inspection uh just last month so and i had a turn signal out so i had to take it in to get the turn signal fixed but uh other than that for passing inspection uh they gave me a shopping list of things i needed to get done yeah namely uh replacing putting the catalytic converter back on the car oh and fixing the emergency brake yeah so those things i could do myself it wasn't a problem yeah what now what state are you in Texas Texas you're in Texas so am i um yeah the the problem i have with this Dodge uh this Dodge Aries is that if i drive the car for reasonable period of time enough to get the car heated up and then i run to run out to do a quick errand and jump back into the car it won't start uh-huh and it won't start until the car is cooled off i've learned that and as soon as it cools cools off it'll start right up i had that problem with a nineteen sixty eight Camaro what was the problem i never did get it fixed oh it it could be the starter that it just gets too hot yeah yeah somebody said that um that uh there must there's probably some kind of short in the starter and that when the car heats up it uh the metal expands to create the short and then it it it isn't until the car cools down that the metal you know these two pieces aren't touching any more and and uh and your you you know then it'll start because you don't have the short yeah but i've taken it to a mechanic and and he started to look at it in fact i drove it out there and i said i bet you anything if you go try start the car right now you won't be able to start it sure enough he couldn't and they had to push it into the garage but they started uh tracing the wires back to see if they could find any shorts or anything and after they fiddled with the wires the problem didn't uh didn't recur recur they couldn't get it to fail hm and sure enough after i'd taken it home for you know a couple of weeks after that i didn't have the problem but now it's starting to recur again yeah so it's just one of those weird things i mean he was willing he said well i think it's in the ignition switch it'll only cost you eighty five dollars but i won't guarantee that's the problem right they never do uh yeah and i'm going well well i don't want to gamble so i just let the car cool off until i get a hard failure uh-huh i've heard of that problem with many other different cars doesn't seem to be prevalent with just one manufacturer and then uh yeah well that's that's that's reassuring i've never had a Dodge before and i mean it seems like a nice little car it's a great deal it only had thirty four thousand miles on it and otherwise it doesn't give me any problems at all i won't buy a Dodge you won't oh yeah my dad had one he had a Dodge yeah six hundred and after thirty thousand miles the head gasket went out oh really Holy mackerel nothing but problems with it so he finally traded it in and actually bought a Ford Escort oh jeez i've you know i've actually had a lot of luck with Fords um um i'm not gonna i'm not gonna sit here and claim that they're the best cars in the world but oh a lot of people do like Fords yeah yeah i mean this this Escort even when the head gasket went i mean it would start first time every time sure and uh uh so i've i've just been real pleased and my step father happens to work at a Ford dealership and that makes things a little easier come car time but yep i'm ready for a new car myself but i've had this car for eleven years and it's given me such little trouble that i i i don't think i could get an adequate replacement that would uh cause me to let huh yeah yeah i just uh i was just talking to somebody who'd had a some kind of i think he had a Cutlass and he had a hundred and ninety five thousand miles on it and finally the thing finally went so he goes out and he buys a Lexus uh-huh and i'm going whoa he he moved up i guess that's what about thirty forty thousand dollars yeah i mean you know he's single he's approaching fifty years old right he doesn't really have anything else to spend his money on i guess not so but uh i can't i just can't imagine i mean are those cars worth thirty or forty thousand dollars i have no idea i know they're they're engineered very well but i would have a hard time justifying spending that kind of money on any car really well it's funny because talk about car repairs i was getting my oil changed and i was sitting in the little lobby it's one of these you know five minute change places and this guy comes storming into the lobby there and he says um you know you guys advertise a twenty dollar oil change and you charged me thirty dollars and the guy says well yeah but you got a Mercedes Benz and it takes a special oil filter uh-huh and the guy was oh yeah he's almost proud that he had to pay an extra ten bucks to get his oil changed i'm going right i don't think that's worth it i don't think spending an extra you know twenty thousand dollars for a car is worth it you know i don't know no dealers will get get you on the oil changes anyway i took my car in one time many years ago for an oil change at the dealer and they charged me thirty dollars for it yeah oh yeah oh jeez they they gave me this cock and bull story that because there was a turbo charger on the car they had to prime the turbine with the oil what and it's it's it's a bunch of hog wash i i've changed the oil myself i've put a filter on you know put the oil in and all it's no problem at all yeah yeah yeah i couldn't i tried to do that with my Escort but there's no way to change to get that oil filter out without that i could figure out without getting underneath the car no i have to get under my car to get the oil filter out but yeah you change it four times a year it's not that big a deal filter you can buy that on sale for two dollars uh the oil um less than a dollar dollar less than a dollar a dollar a quart it's really not that ooh yeah yeah oh yeah i'd prefer to do it but the Escort was very difficult for me to get under and i didn't want to put it up on ramps or anything it just made me nervous uh-huh right i mean can you crawl underneath there or is it well i can get the filter off just by laying down underneath the car i can't crawl under it the clearance isn't enough but enough to reach under and get the filter off it's not a problem hum yeah i just couldn't yeah yeah i think this uh the the Dodge would be pretty easy to change the oil on i think yeah at least i'm going to give it a try cause you can see i mean the oil filters i mean you can touch it it's right there uh-huh for anything else i'll put the car up on jack stands you've got jacks it makes me nervous oh yeah when putting the catalytic converter back on i had to put the right side of the car up on jack stands whoa whoa but it wasn't a real problem yeah yeah hm well i i you know it's just a that's the biggest hassle i think that if i had been nicer to my Escort and been more diligent about getting the oil changes and doing that kind of stuff i could have probably gotten another ten thousand miles out of it yeah every three thousand miles i'll change the oil i've got about ninety four thousand miles on the car right now yeah wow wow and uh its working just fine i don't have any problems at all so i'm going to keep it uh i get offers every now and then from gee yeah from grocery store baggers that want to buy my car because it's a Trans Am they're high school seniors seventeen years old and they got to impress their girl friend yeah all right the trouble is they think they can buy it for a thousand dollars or less right right well i bet you i bet i mean if it's in good condition and stuff you could probably get a pretty good blue book price yeah it's in great shape uh body is in excellent shape it just needs paint i need to look up some place to uh to get the car painted well the paint paint job yeah if you're going to look a new car what would you look at a new car yeah oh i'm not i don't think i'm in the new car market a new car that really hard pick well what what what brand i mean what model would you look
