 you said you're are financial uh financial planner so do you work with individual um yes like companies or i mean well we work with both we work with individuals and we work with companies and executives and um we do business and personal uh financial planning and budgeting and investing for those people so how do you handle your own account how do i handle my own account your your own budget uh well the first part of being of of a good budget or a good financial planner is to uh number one don't have any debt so yes being debt free is very important and keeping a budget uh below your income is important also hm right now i think really the only debt we have is our house and oh that's great you're ahead of most of the people out there then well good but we really don't have a monthly budget that we live on but we don't spend um frivolously either uh-huh uh i mean we don't i don't we don't have anything on the computer that says oops we only have five dollars left to spend this week you know it's not that rigid um well a budget does not have to be rigid hm um i know though i'm expecting and um we're thinking about cutting down to one salary and so when it comes down to that that is going to be quite a change in our income because i not quite fifty percent but maybe forty percent of our income is based on mine um sure so i think when when it comes to that time period we are going to need to watch our our funds a little bit more um right now we're struggling with it oh the thing is that both our cars are paid off but they are the same age and his my husband's car is American mine's Japanese but his is breaking down a lot more you know i haven't had any problems and were were um-hum uh trying to decide well do we go ahead and get another car or do we just drive this one till it breaks you know and if we do what kind of car do we want to get and if we do do we should we pay cash for it or uh try to get a low interest right you you know interest rate well uh one thing that really uh helps i find in budgeting and personally in budget as well as a business budget is prior planning prevents poor results and uh lot of people uh have not even considered that maybe that a car payment a monthly car payment that they put it in every month whether they have a car payment or not and therefore they would save up enough money over a couple year period to replace a vehicle when they needed it we both have done that um we both work at companies that have credit unions uh-huh so we had direct deposit you know for our car payment anyway and when my car was paid off i never told them to you know to stop taking that money out so they've still been putting in oh i don't remember how much my payments were two hundred and fifty three hundred dollars well that is called smart budgeting oh good smart budgeting is that what you said or just smart oh it's real financial planning but we're talking about budgeting so um that is very smart to do and then my husband has done the same thing with his payments so it's just more to us not necessarily setting up for another car but just going into savings uh-huh and i i think our thing right now is the way the interest rates are and uh well that's in our goals i guess for this year first quarter is to examine our financial standing you know and try to decide how we want to invest our money because right now the the uh interest rates on everything seems to be so low that you know i don't really see any benefit over um uh oh i can't remember what we compared it to but over putting your money in say a CD or market money account or something over just a regular savings there wasn't enough difference in the interest rate to make a different i mean to uh i mean i guess our savings account is probably a lot more liquid than CDs or or um right money money markets i don't know what else there i know there are a bunch of different things you can invest in but right right now i don't know what do you think the way things are going right now that well uh um with the economy the way it is it's very important that um we don't spend capital we don't have to because we don't know when we'll need it right and secondly is is that we need to make our money work for us so we don't have to work harder right and uh it just takes time to do that and um if a person has capital resources uh or cash on hand to take care of emergencies  hello i'm Bridgette Michael here nice to meet you nice to meet you where are you i'm in Lubbock Texas Lubbock i'm in Biloxi Mississippi oh really oh my gosh yeah not too far away i know well are you ready for me to push one okay yeah i guess so okay so what kind of cars do you like well um i i like i don't like real big cars i like fairly sporty smaller cars and uh i have a Toyota Celica right now uh-huh uh-huh and um it uh the the question they asked us was what would we buy next that's sort of what i have in mind for the next car that i buy is another Celica uh-huh um what year is it it's an eighty seven okay is it because that's what i have too oh you have a Celica oh really what what year is yours uh-huh i love it i have a eighty nine eighty nine yeah yeah it's a Celica convertible and i love it Toyota makes great cars yeah oh i do too i do too yeah i think so too that's is the second Toyota that i've had really yeah and um we've had it since it's new and uh that's what i i plan on getting another one you know whenever the time comes do you yeah my fiance and i we've talked about it even and he has a um a BMW and they are so expensive to just keep up and stuff uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah yeah i know that we were both like you know if we're gonna get a new car it'd probably i would say it would be a Toyota too uh-huh um-hum for sure what i would really like would be a uh Supra but just can't just can't afford that that's just a little out out of my range uh-huh yeah i know those are nice i think the next car that we'll look into will be more of a i don't know i think is it Toyota 4-Runner yeah um i've heard of it i'm not sure what it's it is is that what they're called something like like a or like a um what are they called the one that the one that Ford makes um the new ones do you know what i'm talking about so a sort of sporty car no they're kind of more like a truck like a Bronco oh okay um oh other than the Bronco i'm not sure i don't know what it is uh they have a new one other than the Bronco you're talking about huh type of yeah yeah no i don't know what it is i haven't even really looked at the vehicles much lately yeah i haven't either but i i would think it would most likely be Toyota oh yeah i think i probably will too because i've had good luck with it never had hardly any problems uh-huh yeah me neither you know and the one i had before was the same way really yeah we had a a uh Tercel before this an eight two Tercel uh-huh um-hum and that thing never gave us any problems really we had a wreck with it and uh the only problems we had was because of the wreck you know front end alignment problems and stuff like that uh-huh but um uh i will i will say this uh the the Celica that i own now i have replaced the clutch in it really yeah and that was last year but um i think so i think you just wear them out because we live you know our area's fairly congested and a lot of traffic so it's but that's understandable yeah you know we use the clutch a lot i do you're stopping and going a lot you know yeah uh-huh i would definitely have to say Toyota though that's the best car i've had oh yeah yeah and uh i don't i'm i'm you know i don't worry about getting a Japanese car you know everybody's talking about buying American and everything and it's the best built yeah i know uh i just like the Japanese cars i think i think they're better made i know uh i feel like i know i do too i feel like if if like Ford or someone could make one that competed with you know i would buy it i would that's right yeah yeah if they could make one as cheap you know too i i got i think the American cars they have the Japanese beat when it comes to big cars of course yeah yeah yeah but uh when it comes to little uh sporty cars or that that kind of a car i i don't think there there's any competition really i think the Japanese have them beat yeah i think there's so much more economicable too just like with gas and everything i mean i can go forever on a tank of gas oh yeah sure i do too um-hum well i can too i'm um it's like i fill up maybe well i fill up about once every week and a half i'd guess i'd say yeah you know and uh i do a lot of driving right now i'm in school and everything so uh-huh um been doing a lot of extra driving but it's you know it's not bad not at all go a far way on that tank of gas i know well that's right that's right well uh is yours the Celica that you have is it a um an ST or a GT or what it's a GT GT mine is an ST what is that uh it's little lower model than the GT is it yeah they had the ST the GT and the GTS you know and the the ST is the uh cheaper version of all three of them um-hum really my mom has a a GTS uh-huh uh-huh she has a eighty nine GTS Celica yeah that's got a little little power more powerful engine and a lot more uh little more options on it so yeah yeah she i know she has this big powerful engine on she doesn't drive i mean she doesn't drive over forty yeah oh yeah well that's the way mothers are i know and the fu nny thing is because she bought it and i don't think the guy really i don't think she realized everything with the insurance and stuff on  okay okay have you done this very long uh well yeah for the last uh couple of months yeah that's the same with us yeah well what kind of car would you buy well it's kind of hard to say uh because i don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years we just oh okay bought uh a car uh last year and then bought one in eighty nine and uh wait a minute we bought one in ninety we've got three cars of all things uh-huh so uh probably we'll be in at least a midsize four door sedan okay what kind do you have now uh we have a a Mazda nine twenty nine and a Ford Crown Victoria and a little two seater CRX oh okay uh it's rather difficult to to project what kind of uh we'd look always look into uh consumer reports to see what kind of uh report or uh repair records that the various cars have uh-huh and then of course we look into the prices yeah and uh for uh we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when when the cars could get to be discounted because we keep we've begun to keep them uh longer a longer period of time uh i traded off an eighty two Oldsmobile for the eighty nine Mazda oh uh-huh so uh and did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic uh yeah yeah we we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life and um we we've had a good many foreign cars uh-huh and uh they they uh i've been extremely we've had three Mazdas we've been extremely pleased with our Mazdas oh really yeah we've always bought American made cars mostly Oldsmobiles yeah well we we've had uh let's see we had uh we had a uh let me think we had a fifty three and a uh we had uh two fifty threes which is a long thirty minute story uh and we had a sixty five and then we had this eighty two uh-huh so we we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles really yeah we've been real pleased with ours i think we've had one two three yeah and most we have a Cutlass we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like a a seventy seven um-hum then we have a Cutlass Sierra and we've had a ninety eight um-hum so but i don't know we'll we're going to be in the market for a car probably in the next year and the financing is always something we consider you know the four percent or when they um-hum give good financing through the the motor company um-hum but i don't know what we're going to buy i always thought i would like to try a foreign made car but boy with all the auto workers being laid off makes me feel guilty so well uh my son over in Shreveport uh sold Porsches Audis Mada Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas oh uh so uh the first foreign car that we had was a a seventy seven MG MGB oh the was British green racing green with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top ooh boy and uh i drove it mostly and i bet it was hard to part with that yeah it really was my husband was in the Air Force and we got transferred to Okinawa oh so uh we had to sell it which which really really tore me up oh yes because uh it was it was great fun and then uh when we got to Okinawa bought well we bought a second hand we uh we decided that uh we had that sixty uh sixty five Oldsmobile and it and it was just too big so we we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States and we got a little Fiat uh and a and the little uh forty horse power Mazda four door sedan oh  okay um have you had any experience in trying to find child care um yes some what um uh-huh we do baby sitting here like my neighbor and i share baby sitting and um then i ran a preschool so i know you know from the other end you know trying to help people find um-hum um-hum really find day care so yeah okay well i've done more or less the same we have five children and um so what about you goodness uh yeah i just haven't found it equitable to work outside the home and so i have done the day care inside my home um-hum how has that worked out well i've done it for seven years and uh it's pretty well driven me crazy oh yeah i can imagine i've got three kids and i think i mean it's sometimes it's easier like last week my husband was gone and i had my three nieces and nephews over and it was really much more calm than than than having just my three at home oh oh was it oh uh-huh that's true sometimes sometimes they do offer a just a play time for your kids but yeah yeah it it depends though it depends on how well behaved the other kids are yeah we have some times its like oh if i can only get these kids uh-huh hum um hang hang on just a second um okay okay just a second i'm on the phone yeah i've got three preschoolers um but uh oh my goodness yeah i mean i i think it's we've wanted to do i've wanted to join a baby sitting co-op oh and um that's we there're several of them around here um the one my my sister in law is in you have to be recommended in to the co-op you know that way some one knows you and you and you just aren't giving your kids out to any body and i just haven't found one that's close enough to me uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh that i feel comfortable with at this point um um-hum but because i mean you don't wanna you don't wanna leave with your kids with anybody and um no no you don't the day care centers around here i i really my kids go to preschool and i have found some really good ones um oh good one of them goes two days a week and the other one goes one day a week and that's a nice break and it's this is a oh how fun i really like the one that that they're in um they've got some really qualified teachers there they've been there for a long long time they've got um a um-hum certified kindergarten teacher doing the curriculum for the older you know the fours and the three year olds and stuff so that's that is really good i really like that oh good um-hum um-hum that would be fun yeah that's good for the kids and then it's fun for you too to have that little break during the week yeah yeah i like that i i like that little break oh oh now on that co-op um do women just trade baby sitting or you you you start out with like coupons and um i don't i think i think you start out like with say twenty or thirty and and you have to um oh when when you baby sit somebody they pay you in coupons and then um they uh then you pay the other people in coupons and i think some of them is in like thirty minute time slots or in hour time slots and you have to do it oh um-hum oh gosh you know per child um at least the the ones that i've seen that have worked and then they normally get together like once a month and um to you know decide you know how many do you have and and then uh-huh uh-huh they say okay you need to you know if if you're taking in a lot of baby sitting and you're not you know doling it out also then um a lot of times they'll say okay you need to you know you need to let people sit for you um that way it'll even out you some people aren't getting you know without they don't have any more coupons left uh-huh uh-huh oh what my goodness and um their monthly meetings the one i went to one and they a lot of times they'll have um special people come and talk about uh-huh uh say safety or you know different things with about children and some times they'll just have get togethers you know even even with the kids like during the day and stuff um-hum so it gets them helps them to know one another and then you know its can be pretty informative also oh well that sounds like a terrific idea my goodness i haven't heard of anything like that out here in Utah and it sounds like that'd be something good to start huh yeah yeah i that's i don't know all the um i don't know all the details uh um i i i don't know if it seems like it seems like her the my sister in law's um uh they are in  so how do you feel about the Vietnam War well um you know i guess that it's pretty deep feelings uh i just uh went back and rented uh the movie what is it Good Morning Vietnam um-hum and uh got that uh uh some insight there to to kind of help me put together the feelings i really appreciated the the little uh yeah i saw that as well English class where the uh the uh fellow just wouldn't do anything you know the guy's gouging gouging your eyes out what are you going to do you know wait for him to finish me off um-hum and uh it it was uh good to remember the uh that that kind of Asian philosophy um-hum well uh were you over in Vietnam or that uh no no i was kind of an in between uh finally drew a high draft number and you i'm i was much too young i was born in sixty seven so oh um in a way both my well uh both my brothers were um draft age but neither of them wound up going over which i think they were very happy for well i personally uh you know uh i just went in limbo i had a passport and was ready to go uh um-hum or um out of the country or or join special forces either one yeah um-hum i mean i i just didn't know so uh well um so well do you do you feel that it was worth what we did over there or um yeah just a second okay you restrict access cause a lot of times people are trying to cut them out okay sure now well Mark um what was that again um do you think i mean do you think our investment the investment in lives and money was worth it no not not really i totally agree with that um um well what what effects do you think it's had in our country downside um uh well Robert Blythe says we should uh uh yeah go into the grief that that's there and we're our presidents have always avoided that as a country so it's pretty serious really uh um-hum um-hum a lot of things that aren't being addressed um-hum well i think i think that you know that's pretty typical of the of the entire entire involvement over in that you know that nothing was really addressed it wasn't it wasn't you know it was never we we announced that we were going to war it was it was such a gradual and subtle you know the um you know increasement of of force that yeah Gulf of Tonkin uh resolution and was it a dolphin or a torpedo things you remember that um-hum i vaguely vaguely remember we um we had a we had a um spy ship torpedoed or something or something like that yeah yeah only only it was foggy and President uh President finally President Johnson said well they they weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo oh well isn't that something um-hum um so um do you do you do you think that like our um for example like in in this this past war the Persian Gulf war um-hum that uh that you see it seemed to me that that Bush was going going to extraordinary lengths to um you know prepare the country for war yeah okay hey Mark uh i've got to go um we'll um see you i guess our five minutes are up according to me are they to you okay uh i wasn't really keeping count count but i guess that's good-bye yeah okay bye-bye bye  well what do you think about how we've changed in the last ten twenty years i think it's pretty amazing i think um that my grandparents especially have seen a whole lot of change in their lives but um in in like in what ways particularly are you thinking well technology but also morals morals and things like that i think even even in the last like four years you can still see things falling so fast and that can be uh-huh for me that's the biggest change it's so frustrating um to see everything disintegrating disintegrating and losing control your your losing control it seems like of the moral fiber of our society yeah it seems that well it its a seems like it's definitely a transitional time i'm not sure exactly what's happening there're good things that have happened but but at the moment we're suffering from i think information overload for one thing um just just the technology like you mentioned um-hum um-hum faxes and car phones and VCRs and all of that that make us so immediate there there's no time for relationships talking sitting being with each other all of that i think you're really right i think like well even with computers um oh yes you can there i mean there's so much that's happening in in that field and it it just has forced us to go so fast and um even the way we write it used to be if you read a book like you know Thomas Hardy takes two chapters to establish the mood and um-hum and just describes the scenery and what's been going on and stuff and now we just chopped all that out and say well let's get to the point and exactly no patience yeah no attention span yeah exactly these sound bites you're exactly right i mean all there's all that and then we've got the rich getting richer and everyone else getting poorer with with you know with with little hope of of having any impact i think impotence is a is a a word that that suits most of America now we don't feel like we can influence you know influence anything yeah you feel out of control uh-huh uh-huh like just a few people have it all wrapped up and they're not going to let you through um yeah um-hum um-hum and it's a bad feeling yeah it is it's really frustrating and the way our families you know our nuclear families are disintegrating and stuff it's just a real um-hum um-hum you don't have the the social networks we used to have to yeah go ahead to protect the family and protect the people in the family and things like that with everyone moving you know every five years you lose your contacts you lose trusted friends that you know they'll do things you know in America it seems now it's independence is the thing and um-hum um-hum you know heaven forbid if you ask anyone for anything yeah then that's whereas we used to be able to depend on each other and trust each other and you'll help me and i'll help you not and not in this corrupted sense but in the sense of you know when you're in trouble and you need someone you know someone to babysit the kids sure um-hum the interdependence interdependence in a nice way yeah exactly yeah i think uh i i don't know there was a lot there was good and bad in the nuclear family we've certainly found out a lot about the bad about it yeah uh but but but the community however the family looked and it didn't always look like a nuclear family even then you know you had generations living together or you know whatever community has just definitely been lost and um-hum i think a lot of people are trying to reestablish it in all sorts of different ways um you know well okay so we don't have a small town and okay so we move but you know maybe there's some way that we can have a group that works together you know everything from people who do live in communal you know almost commune areas that they've started up again you know um special cities or little towns that do that to people who do it through a church or through a book club or something i mean something you know even offices have started sort of becoming the community yeah yeah i think i think because it's a necessity yeah as as as human beings we need a network around us of people we can rely on i guess that's uh thing is that right now it's such a um um-hum and yeah temporary thing that how far does it go how far can you depend on them and they're so much more fragile at the touch you know yeah yeah and that's a good point and and we don't have the intergenerational generational community either which means that do you do you have to be between twenty and forty to be accepted and if  so do you do a lot of camping uh well yeah a fair amount mostly with boy scouts oh is that right uh-huh um my sons are in the boy scouts also uh so i know they go a lot of camping but i don't go with them but uh we used to live in California and we did a little bit of camping in California not all that much but um enough to get a little flavor for it uh where mostly do you go with your camping well mostly uh well boy scout camps near uh near Dallas uh in in fact i i think i know your sons Danny and Sean right Jan Novak oh who am i talking to oh i can't believe that well we can talk about anything well but we can talk about camping none the less they didn't you know this is really funny because i i've tried to make these phone calls um whenever it pops in my head and sometimes they say oh we can't find another party and after they they say that two times i can't keep hanging on the phone and i just saw that card down there and now i'm really supposed to be baking bread for Cistercian i said oh i'll make another phone call i guess another five dollars helps so anyway but we we should talk about camping because they're recording this oh we have to talk about oh that's right we're on this recording thing well anyway um we used to go camping out in California up by Mendocino and um to um uh Lasson Park which is a volcanic a volcanic park and uh that was absolutely extraordinary and the rangers there that uh um-hum do the tours and the little classes and the lectures and everything were quite extraordinary so that was uh one of our uh major camping times that we enjoyed very very much uh do you ever go camping outside of the boy scouts well we used to do a lot of camping uh in fact before we had kids Marie and i would go we did a lot of canoe camping uh either in upstate New York where there are a lot of lakes up near Lake Placid and in that area and in Northern Ontario which is also full of lakes oh yes uh-huh and some of our longest trips went for about six days and covered about seventy miles where you you canoe oh my uh from lake to lake sometimes by rivers where they connect or else you have to portage your canoe and all your equipment to the next lake um-hum um-hum um and so that that was a i i think it's a lot in a way easier to go canoe camping because you you don't have to watch the weight so much um-hum and it's also cleaner because you can go swimming every day and it's very easy to keep keep cool and keep clean oh that's true too uh-huh and that's we took one canoe trip in California now but the boys were very very small when we were out there and um it was a friend of Webbie's that got this group together and uh there had been some rains and therefore the river was a little more swift than what might normally be expected and um i i i found it exciting but i really thought that it was a trifle dangerous maybe because the currents were kind of bad and we just went ahead anyway but it was the Russian River yeah what what river was that yeah i've seen i've seen the Russian River we never went canoeing on it that that can get pretty fast yeah yeah yeah it can and it did and um it was my first time it was Webbie's first time doing this also and we just trusted uh trusted in the uh knowledge of this friend that got this party together that it would not be over dangerous and we had our um-hum life belts on and everything else like that but we did dump over once and uh you know with small children like that just made me very nervous we didn't go again the next day we just uh kind of uh um-hum stayed by camp site and uh cooked but it it was it was very exciting and sure sure really very nice and um i wouldn't mind doing something like that again and i guess the first time you do a major endeavor like that you really are a neophyte you don't know exactly what to expect or even sometimes what to do but um it it was quite an experience uh yeah well you you have to be careful um-hum um-hum yeah yeah so you have to be careful your your guys are going to Philmont are they oh yes well Sean is Daniel went last summer so again right so Danny's not going again no no no he's not gonna go again this time but uh you're gonna inherit Sean on this trip and uh um-hum okay well i'll i'm going with them so i know uh-huh have you been out there before oh you haven't well Daniel says it's i think it's really quite challenging no really uh absolutely uh i kind of got the information by drips and drabs from last summer as different friends would talk to him and apparently whoever has to carry that water or part  okay um well why don't you go ahead and start because you have more experience it sounds like well i've got two kids one of them 's a year old and one of them 's going on three um-hum and in California anyways where i'm located my husband's in the Navy it's really hard to find child care around here because most people that are around here um-hum they're either Mexican or Filipino and they don't speak English so it's like my kids pick up really funny words and they come home and say something to me and i don't understand what they're saying oh and it's like i mean day care is really expensive it costs like three hundred dollars oh goodness for day care for two kids for a month and when they come home i don't even understand half the stuff they're saying uh-huh oh goodness so do they know what they're saying though do they seem to know the words that they're saying um sometimes because they're they're real young yeah yeah because that could be a blessing further down the road but it can also be a problem now like one day he came home and said something and i asked him what he was saying i told him to point to it so i could understand what he was saying and he was talking about the cartoon you know Peter Pan uh-huh oh uh-huh but he said it you know in i i don't even remember i don't i don't even know which one it was it was either Spanish or Filipino i'm not even sure which language it was oh goodness but he knew it was Peter Pan it's just he didn't say Peter Pan hm and so it's kind of hard to understand what they're saying um-hum but i don't wanna tell him not to say it because there's nothing wrong with it um-hum it's just makes it hard to understand yeah yeah they'll be because at this age they're real real young and they could pick up any kind of language it it's amazing how easy they can learn yeah well i've uh i got two children as well my oldest is eight and my youngest is four and i used to teach and when my first one was born i was lucky enough to be able to choose whether i wanted to work or not and even though i had just gotten my Master's degree i chose to stay home just because i worried a lot about child care and really wanted to be able to be that person that raised my children and yeah i like you're feeling the frustration of what they're picking up on that's exactly the worries that i had is that i worried about what kind of things they might be exposed to or pick up on and i was just really paranoid and i guess just decided to be my own child's caregiver and at times i've regretted it just because i miss working with adults and uh you know speaking regular language more than the the children's you know kind of language yeah and actually having conversations instead of one line sentences right right and as a cartoon once said i would like to have dinner with someone who can cut their own meat and that kind of thing um really but now i'm getting up at the at the stage where i will need to go back to work and so i'm looking at this issue and my four year old is just at the point where she'll be starting kindergarten next year which is still only half day so we'll still have to look at that kind of of set up for her so yeah my husband and i made a deal when our second son was born because we had i had to work um-hum there was after our second son was born there wasn't any choice i had to work um-hum so we made a deal he's in the Navy and six months out of the year he's gone on a ship oh so for those six months i don't work i stay home with the kids uh-huh but while he's in dock and he's you know on shore duty for six months then i work in the daytime um-hum and we have child care for them it's only six months out of the year but still it it's just it's kind of weird because the quality of day care is different than what i'm used to because i'm i'm originally from Arizona yeah really oh are you so am i yeah what part oh okay i was in the Phoenix uh Mesa area Mayer yeah a little tiny dinky town up by Prescott oh okay but um it's really strange because i'm used to just going to my next door neighbor and she babysat me and you know when i first had when we first had our first son she babysat him until we moved and um-hum it's really different here oh yeah because now you're depending on other people that you don't know yeah moneywise and you don't know them and you're worried you know uh-huh i mean i know a lot of people say well it never happens to you it just happens to other people when children disappear but it's still scary when you have to look for day care yeah yeah you know you always have that fear yeah i got to find somebody really you know really that i can depend on that's right yeah and even if you have someone there right at your own house doing that kind of day care you still always have that little worry i'm sure yeah so that's that is a problem what kind of criteria do you look for when you are shopping around well i have a notebook and in it i have the top thirty questions and that may sound kind of strange but uh-huh it's i'm just kind of paranoid as a mother it's like i want my child safe  so um do you have a PC yes i have a Macintosh SE thirty um-hum yeah one of my friends are into Macintoshes i have a um PC my a IBM PC myself um-hum a two eighty six but i'm probably eventually gonna get a three eighty six um what do you use yours for mostly um mostly um word processing applications and uh just as a dumb terminal uh uh-huh but i'm um i think eventually i'll start using it for spread sheets and things like that um what do you find that you use yours mostly for well i do a lot of word processing and spread sheets and data base and uh about the only thing i am uh i'm just starting to get in into uh a little bit more communications now i've just today ordered a fax modem so i'll be able to um-hum send and receive faxes right over there without using you know you don't have to make a hard copy that way um-hum uh are you using windows no i i think i i'm planning on like moving up getting a three eighty six before i move up to Windows although you know i do like the the graphical user environment yeah uh-huh uh-huh well it's getting to be more and more like a Macintosh yeah it's just um i want it i want it you know well i just i just want it more for multitasking which i suppose is also like a Macintosh um um-hum well the one thing i used to use a i've never used an IBM actually i used to use a just an Apple two E which of course is looks pretty primitive now um-hum yeah i used that's what i learned a lot of languages on was an Apple two E in my high school but i don't have any uh any real programming capabilities on my uh Mac right now i don't have uh any compilers um-hum um-hum so i'm uh wanting well do you use your computer for uh just things around the house or in the in the i use it in my business i see what do you do i uh do uh consultation and and testing of various kinds for uh English as a second language programs oh wow um and uh are these like uh do these programs um are they are they based on on a on a um other language or are they based are are they based like a lot of the um i know a lot of the the English as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of you know parts of the world and the teacher just tries to tries to teach English you know through natural understanding that's uh exactly what yeah that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly you seem to be uh better informed than the average person on that um-hum well it was just uh when i was high school i worked for the community school and they had a English second language class and it always seemed strange to me that you know all these all these people that you know spoke English not too well and spoke you know a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time um-hum imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you have to you know you don't have as many cues you can't don't have hand gestures and things like that right well now we uh what i use a computer for is to write materials that are later printed though most of the stuff that i do is not uh interactive um-hum um-hum and then i use it for testing uh data analysis on testing so oh to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that well just actually just uh item analysis statistical analysis of the tests uh um-hum you know when you when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing um-hum and find out which ones are discriminating well and which ones aren't find out how reliable the test is you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort so it's involves a lot of spread sheet use um-hum yeah i'd imagine so um so um what were you doing when you were using an Apple two E well i was doing some of the same stuff but doing it more slowly and with smaller files i can't believe you know i've got uh five uh megabytes on this one now and on my two E i had a hundred twenty eight K um-hum it it's amazing yes it it's amazing you know how how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much i remember my first computer was a TRS eighty with four K on it yeah and you know and then then i moved and then i started playing with Apples you know and and those had forty eight or you know if if they were really great they had sixty four K you know oh the old the old Apple uh the the the original Apple had what yeah forty eight i guess didn't it uh all i know i know that in my school they had a bunch that had sixteen K on them is all and there's i remember that there was one game that i played that required forty eight K and there was only one computer that had forty eight K on it at the time my goodness uh-huh and you know it's just so amazing that generally you know if you if you i'm not sure about about um Macintoshes but i know in IBM's you you you generally you know you buy a megabyte at a time um-hum you know that's that's your low that's the low end um well the SE thirty goes up to eight um-hum but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that and and get another possibly another hard disk i don't know they say that system seven uses a lot of memory um-hum yeah imagine just to support  it's recycling well uh i think it's a really good thing because um of all the materials we use and things like cans and bottles and stuff like that it's just a complete waste uh you know make them and then throw them away and bury them out in a dump somewhere when you can just as easily melt them down and reuse them exactly i agree and uh there's a i mean there's so many products that are like that it's just too bad that they can't find more that we could recycle well you know i think it all depends on the consumer the more we uh demand from from the people that are producing these goods that they use recycled products the more you know innovative that they'll be yeah you're right there but then there's things like the uh newspaper market where they try and recycle as much as they can and then they no one will there's not a market for it right yeah or it ends up costing a lot more to recycle it than it does just to make it so yeah well uh do you have a recycling program where you live oh yeah uh i go to Indiana University here and its real big and all the buildings are recycling bins for all kinds of materials uh-huh do you have plastics and that kind of kind of stuff yeah and also the uh well the University's really big about it they have contests in the dorms and stuff to see who can uh recycle the most stuff and uh-huh so this is like in within the school yeah within the school and also the city here has uh do they have curbside recycling yeah monthly curbside recycling that is nice see we don't have that here it's going that direction but it hasn't come yet at least to my area and uh and i'm really anxious to uh uh-huh right get that because i mean it's terrible it's really inconvenient for anybody to drive you know on the other side of town and bring all your lug all that stuff you know dirty right you know things and and so i i think that a lot more people would do it if it was you know at their door right but then you do don't you get paid when you take your own uh well it really depends on the product and the place you go some some places will will pay you and some others others won't uh-huh so um it depends on you know um the demand for the product that you have right sounds like you are an avid recycler i'm on the recycling committee at work so everybody comes to me with all their questions so i try to know as much as possible are you uh-huh but uh we just at work started recycling cans and um what else and paper you know office paper right yeah we do that at work too but we don't do you know we don't do plastics or glass and those are easily recycled products in a lot of cases but you know you know they have the little recycling triangle right and some of those numbers in there mean that these products aren't really recyclable uh-huh so that's kind of inconvenient as well why put recyclable if its in in seventy five percent of the recycling centers you can't recycle it right well aren't there pop cans that are like that also yeah exactly because they have mixed metals or something um-hum yep well anything else well no not really well reduce reuse and recycle right right words to live by that's right i try to remember them i guess we've covered it okay it was nice talking to you bye-bye now you too bye-bye  what do you think about drug testing i think it's pretty good i think they should do it especially in uh in companies where uh you deal with uh either with other people or with uh stuff that uh i want to say uh deals directly with people's lives like hospitals and stuff yeah yeah but um everywhere uh you know when uh when i was in college when uh everywhere i i applied a job for uh pretty much did a drug test because most of them were like defense contractors and stuff uh-huh except uh the the last job the job i actually took they didn't care oh is that right was it a large or a small company so it's a big company it's uh MCI telecommunications and i think uh they may require it for like the field engineers the people that actually go out you know and drive their trucks around and stuff like that uh or run the heavy machinery but they don't require it for you know the engineering positions uh-huh uh-huh is that right yeah i was kind of surprised but defense contractors only want you doing it because uh they don't want you to sell drugs or buy drugs for you know for secrets or something you know well sure i there's that part of it i think and and i think most defense contractors also have other divisions of the company right that can also be affected by that and i think what they have to do in the interest of fairness or to keep from getting sued or something is test everybody in the company at least on a random basis in other words no matter whether you work in uh defense or um-hum um-hum hum right consumer products or whatever you'd you'd have an equal chance of being tested um-hum i don't i don't know i just think it's a sick thing that we've come to that i don't like the way the world's going yeah i mean yeah i mean i have i have no problem i mean people complain so much you know about random drug testing and infringing their rights and all this stuff and you know i i don't know i guess it's bad you know to to go inside somebody you know hand them a urine sample bottle you know but uh well does it i've heard a lot of discussions about this and i guess the scariest part of it is the chance of a false positive right right and and that's what what really upsets a lot of people who are you know very straight and probably wouldn't ever think of using drugs but the idea that they could lose their jobs right or in our case be forced to go to all this counseling and that sort of stuff you know just in the case of a false positive uh-huh well i mean now even if you had a false positive i mean they're they're better you can have retests or what do they do test on your hair uh no urine they can uh well can't they also test your hair yes they can and i think that's probably be more acceptable i believe it's more accurate right right but that's not what they're doing at my company oh really no it's urine samples i haven't been tapped yet to do this okay well you know but they certainly started out i believe with the managers and folks like that uh-huh uh-huh well they uh i mean all the places i went to you know they gave us you know small tests and stuff like that i guess if uh you could always get a second opinion i mean if your company tests positive i mean i i i would just think there was a way there'd be a way around it if i mean even if you did test positive you could probably get tested again and uh test negative yeah well and any way have time for that wouldn't it yeah i i suppose i suppose it's it's just you know the whole idea of all the hassles you'd have to go through and certainly the records that would be left behind yeah um-hum you know everybody has databases these days and they know a lot more about me than i'll ever remember i'm sure yeah and a matter of fact i think there are too many of these dull databases going around yeah well i'm i'm certainly certainly sure that uh any drug test results would become a part of that yeah that's true i guess they put it in your personnel file probably so yeah because i i'm i'm you know i'm surprised they don't do it you know in uh in my organization yeah but uh well i certainly believe in it for uh people like airline pilots right or uh what seems to be more of a problem train drivers uh-huh yeah train and also uh uh uh boat captains i mean not necessarily big boat captains but small the uh small personal boats uh-huh they had trouble with uh not just substance abuse but uh alcohol abuse and stuff oh sure and they had these boat crashes and you know all these people were getting arrested and and they finally said no more alcohol out there you know in uh like where i used to live in Virginia oh they had a lot of problems with uh with boat wrecks and involving you know alcohol related incidents and uh drug related incidents yeah so they finally just said uh if we catch you we're going to take away your license and take away your boat if we have to huh so straightened a few people out well i guess it would i guess so well i don't know i i i really haven't sorted out all my feelings on the drug testing uh i'm totally straight would never consider using drugs um um-hum well you know i'm the same way but uh it it sort of goes back to it's a presumption of guilt and you have to prove that you're innocent um-hum um-hum um-hum on the other hand uh  okay well um about capital punishment first of all i know that in uh Texas they have lethal death by lethal injection i guess that's the uh preferred method have they used anything else yeah i don't know to tell you the truth i don't follow it uh any more than i have to but i do know someone was just recently uh in in Texas in your memory i see oh yeah that's that's kind of the euphemistic term for it um so uh have you been following the the Dahlmer case at all put to sleep exactly ooh no more than again no more than i have to um i have very mixed feelings about this whole issue um that one's a little too grizzly too huh uh i i really don't like the idea of of uh death penalty capital capital punishment however you want to put it um-hum um and yet i do concur that there are some people that have to be kept away forever yeah i mean i really do think there are some people that there's nothing that can be done about so it makes a dilemma for me hum i see um do you think that uh putting putting those people in jail permanently would be an equally good solution i i the i always think about it in terms of myself and i really wonder if i'd really wanna be in jail for the rest of my life or just killed um-hum i mean i think i and some have asked to be killed you know there there have been been some criminals who said and this is what i want and i can yeah i can see that side of it um-hum uh because i don't know what life is like what what life means if you're in jail the rest of your life um-hum well certainly for for someone like Charles Manson who's very definitely going to stay in jail for the rest of his life i uh i i can't imagine that he will ever be allowed out by the parole board that uh his life is not going to improve um-hum um do you think uh do you think that that uh the death penalty is effective as a means of retribution a a deterrent or right yeah yeah as as as a deterrent value yeah i'm not i don't know uh uh you know i don't think we've we haven't used it enough they say in in in countries where you know you're gonna have your hand cut off you know if you steal et cetera that that it has that that there is less crime uh we certainly let our people out um-hum way too fast i don't know i don't think i've got enough evidence on that what about you um well to be honest i think that the uh capital punishment is is is a uh red herring in the crime and punishment business um-hum um as you said we're letting our people out far too much really the problem is that i i think two fold number one in Los Angeles as you may know there's uh lots and lots of problem high crime areas and and uh in black parts of town the cops the cops don't trust the the people who live there and the people don't live there trust people don't trust the cops who who uh um-hum run the beat so in this heated air of mistrust people don't do what's necessary um-hum to keep crime down because uh you know if if uh it takes too much work or if you're liable to get beaten just because you're black or whatever things are not going to change and so capital punishment doesn't matter if the criminals who are committing the crimes don't get caught in the first place right and may be killed on the street anyway death is not that big a i mean one way or the other death is part of their everyday lives oh yeah as as uh i mean a white collar person thinking they may get killed you know that's a big deal yeah but the other people are thinking they may get killed when they get up and walk to school yeah exactly you know John John Singleton who's who uh made the film um Boys in the Hood noted that uh one in twenty five black men will be killed at the hands of other black men yeah yes yeah and uh that's you know for them the death penalty is irrelevant i mean it's what what difference is that going to make to them there's got to be more effective policing and there's got to be more trust on both sides of the equation yeah yeah that's right that that's right and uh what we do is we keep coming up with ways to handle i mean i just heard the attorney general or i think it was on PBS the other night briefly going by because it made me to angry but he was talking about how wonderful our presidents have been because uh we've gotten this and that many more jails and  hi i'm Bridget i'm Paul nice to meet you pleased to meet you where are you i'm in Texas are you so am i where are you in Texas Dallas okay i'm in Lubbock oh okay okay are you ready for me to push one sure anytime okay so what do you think about capital punishment well i think it's a necessary uh a necessary tool that uh needs to be used uh to establish justice in some cases and to that that it if used properly uh-huh uh i think it can be uh it would it would be a useful deterrent um-hum what do you think about Jeffrey Dahmer like not getting since they don't have it in yeah well i think that i think there are certain people in society that have no redeeming yeah uh worth to them and that it's it it's a waste for society to continue to support those people those people should be you know disposed of yeah i know because it's like it's kind of like a tough call because all they do is sit in jail and the jails are overcrowded you know it's like problem upon problem upon problem that's right it's like you could put them in jail for the rest of his life well all the jails are already overcrowded you know and they add more problems you know since jails are overcrowded they have to reduce you know time to like one third of what you're supposed to do it you know it gets kind of ridiculous yeah that's right i mean they probably you know we the you know our our justice system is not designed to be either efficient or effective or just you know it it's designed yeah as a set of artificial rules that you know judges and lawyers play with each other um-hum i know i i guess i could be for it and against it in some ways i mean i think i'm definitely for it and stuff when i think of someone like like him that killed all those people and has no remorse or anything you know i feel like that's the right thing to do and i guess i would have to say it would be for more circumstances you know well it it it uh yeah but it you know the the problem is it when when we administer it by you know i i mean like like in Texas we have the death penalty right and they killed a guy a while back and you know he'd been in jail for twelve or fifteen years or something like that waiting uh-huh right uh you know waiting waiting waiting waiting his sentence yeah see i think that what is the point of that what what there there's no point in it i mean where did that come from well it it's because it's because you know people don't wanna recognize how to make you know how to how to make a punishment effective yeah i mean it punishing the person by killing them doesn't do anybody any good um-hum the only reason the only way it does some good is if it convinces convinces somebody else that they shouldn't do something like that yeah that's true definitely true and you know if the guy waits around ten or twenty years or whatever it is you know how is that a deterrent to anybody see why do you have any clue why that they sit on like death row that long because the courts require it i mean they they they have said that well everybody has to have certain you know has to have the the the right to appeal well see yeah i understand that but not only do they have the right to appeal they must appeal and you know they the the lawyers go in there and they generate it takes prolong it forever well they generate all kinds of possible reasons that they might be able to appeal uh you know they they're they're trying to generate um-hum technicalities you know things which aren't really related to whether the guy did it or not but as to whether something in the process was right or wrong yeah yeah the the yeah see and you know it it it doesn't work you know our whole justice system doesn't work like that yeah it'd be easier if at least if someone was you know sentenced to death then if they were to have to have an appeal it should be taken care of as quickly as possible you know yes that's right and i understand appeals take a long time and everything else but you know i mean they should have like God there's something so it'd be done faster you know because then they complain about the jails and the this and that and this and that and people sitting on death row for like fifteen years well that's dumb yes um-hum it is it's terrible mean mean at least if you're going to do it do it like because i mean that's like even torture kind of you know oh i again i i don't feel sorry for the for the for the victim that that's on you know for the for the criminal yeah  okay so you have eight children um what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together oh we spend a lot of time out doors jogging bicycling uh going to the park um some time watching VCR movies um-hum um-hum um generally cheap things uh-huh yeah we know how that goes uh with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation well that's fun so um that's right let's see uh some of the things we do together as a family we like to play games a lot and uh you may think this is funny but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek and we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark in our house yeah and that is so fun the kids just get a crack out of that um we like we do like to go to the park too you like your family um we don't do a lot of vacationing have you taken a lot of vacations together or most of our vacations are to go and see Grandma and Grandpa we get an occasional one or two day thing but most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa uh-huh and where oh oh now where do they live in Arizona oh so that's a bit of a drive for you then oh so you like to go there for the holidays and yes oh we don't go very often for holidays generally we try to get all of our kids back home for the holidays um-hum and let Grandma and Grandpa come and visit us oh uh-huh uh what are the ages of your kids then they range from twenty four to five oh yeah so you have some in the nest and some out huh we have ours start at twelve and then they go down to four that's right how old are your children i think the hardest thing for us has been is to find activities you know leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together so i bet yeah with the age span that we have you know like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing but the young kids don't understand it um-hum yes uh-huh and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that and yes and then if you want to play something on the little kids' level then the older kids get real bored and and they want to and do something else so yeah i can i can relate to that yeah um do you feel that the current trend in families spending time together is a positive one or a negative one i think it's improving actually uh-huh we had an interesting experience the other day we we have a pretty much a a routine that we spend we don't have our kids play with other kids on Sunday and we just kind of keep them at home uh-huh um-hum and our next door neighbor uh we were at a soccer game Saturday and our next door neighbor was there somebody came up and asked if if their daughter could spend Saturday night at their house and she said no Sundays our family day and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them um-hum um-hum that's good and i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now i think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just all running every different direction oh good um-hum and i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now i think so and i feel like you know like President Bush Bush has mentioned quite often that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation and it does begin with the families at home yeah and so i i'm a firm believer in that too i think a lot of people are panicked how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something so um yes that's that's true well we see that a lot out here in Utah and um so hopefully hopefully it's going to spread huh that's a good Utah's a lot better than Texas oh um do you have a lot of large families out there in Texas or yeah very few very few you feel like you're in the minority yeah oh definitely when we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense but uh oh dear oh well out here in Utah five is about the the average yeah average yeah my wife and i were in Utah until i guess we were about twenty four oh uh-huh and we've never been back since then but we have kids up there now so we get up occasionally oh oh oh i have some relatives out there in Texas in fact my mom's out there in Texas right now in Dallas spending a month with her cousins on their ranch and where where in Dallas well uh no i'm trying Aberdeen hum it is that close to Dallas oh don't you it's i guess guess it's out there clear out they have a ranch it has like five hundred acres and i don't have any idea i've never heard of it must be a little town yeah  well i don't know how you feel about drug testing but i'm dead set against it well so we can have a conversation on on agreeing with one another today right because we keep working to see if we can find any candidates who will help us change the the trend that we have seem to have of interfering with people's personal life yeah um i think about the only candidates that are out there that are you know anti antiwar on drugs or VIV war on rights is uh pretty much your Libertarian candidates which um i personally have some doubts as to whether any of them can get elected elected well that's always a problem i have to admit that that back when uh the Texas governorship um-hum race was going on that was the one thing that made me really pleased with Ann Richards is that she refused to get involved in discussing that whole issue um-hum uh-huh well it just i mean really seems the ridiculous because um the um U S Department of Labor whatever i'm not sure might be a different agency requires um businesses to post this poster that has like minimum wage laws and a bunch of other laws and one of things it posts is um on the illegality illegality of um lie detector tests and um you know i feel that lie detector tests are for self decrimi self incrimination kind of thing yeah well it means that that that there are limits there are there are definite government limits to you know how an employer can use lie detectors on its employees and i think that oh i mean i don't i i agree that the lie detectors are inappropriate but i think you know that it's hard to justify being i don't understand how our government can can encourage drug testing and discourage lie detector tests because they seem like they're testing the same sort of nebulous yeah yeah because the the tests are equally unreliable and character um-hum personally i don't even think it's a question of whether they're reliable or not i mean it doesn't matter how reliable they are then i think that it's inappropriate you know actually i can almost understand it more for somebody who's getting ready to hire someone than i can allowing them to spot test or random test people who are um-hum oh yeah currently employed because i think that current employment you know continuation of employment should be based on performance yeah yeah and and you know i i agree with with a lot of people that you know claim instead of having random drug tests for continuing employment have um motor impairment tests um because you know the they they would not be any more priced they would they would okay be similarly priced um and you know if some if some guy goes to work and he had a had a fight with his wife the night before and you know he has that on his mind and isn't gonna be able to function properly you know i i just as you know i'd i'd almost as much you know have as much uh fear of him driving the bus i'm riding than or maybe more well you know if you stop and think about it yeah yeah or maybe more yeah i'll show her stop and think about it you can get awfully hostile and decide to to take care of the whole world one day or something yeah well you're absolutely right um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum and also and also on the question of you know just getting employment i'm you know i'm i'm a senior in college and i'm applying for jobs and i know i know a lot of people that are doing it also and i know some of some of which that do indulge in certain um you're absolutely right uh non uh sanctioned um hobbies and their basic attitude toward drug testing is is just um moving away moving away from you know the relatively harmless drugs like marijuana which uh you know lingers for about thirty five days to things like cocaine and LSD which you know one they don't test for well LSD they don't test for and cocaine which only stays in your system for about a week and i used to snort i just you know wonder what effect this is having you know uh it certainly sounds that if if that's what college students are doing that that's anti productive um and i and i mean that's you know that's entirely anecdotal evidence i know a couple people you know that have moved in the direction but yeah i just you know wonder you know overall what the trend is well that of course there's really there's really no way to know uh it's um-hum i just you know unfortunately i've i've talked with a um some friends of mine who are lawyers recently about that because my husband's in a job situation that um um-hum makes him um-hum subject to this sort of thing and it makes him extremely unhappy with his work place um-hum and uh you know not that he does it not that he's ever done it you know i mean he's he's one of the straightest people i know which is it and it has nothing to do with um-hum um-hum you know with any of the rest of it he doesn't like the feeling of loss of control so he doesn't yeah and just the feeling that you know you the there there's so he yeah so he wouldn't do it but on the other hand he also doesn't like the sense of loss of control of his personal life  i'm Bridget i'm Melissa Melissa Brigette Moore yes what are you doing nothing i'm just sitting here trying to eat bread before i go to a meeting are you in Dallas or Lubbock no i'm in Lubbock oh are you yeah what are you doing are you at the office how funny huh where are you i'm at home are you yeah cool i know like listen to us we're like trying to volunteer okay are you ready for me to push one yeah do we know what we're going to say about crime yeah okay i'll push one okay okay so what do you think about crime in the big D well i'm worried about my car because i just got a new car and are you so i'm worried about it getting stolen or anything happening to it at all um-hum so i don't know i think in Dallas it's a lot more scary just because it's a big city i mean in Lubbock and stuff i know lots of people that don't lock their doors or you know leave their windows open at night because it's so much smaller i mean it feels safer yeah yeah and i know that it happens here but it's not near like it is in Dallas yeah people are more trustworthy i think yeah people have reason to be i guess i don't know i don't it doesn't matter where i go i lock my doors yeah so i know lots of people that'll leave their doors open you know if you have to go get something like get a book or something from their house you can just walk right in they're always unlocked or something and gee i don't think i'd ever do that if i wasn't at home i mean see i know and there're only like certain you know neighborhoods up in Lubbock that are that you wouldn't leave your doors unlocked you know yeah but besides that i don't know it's fairly safe i think God even up in like Highland Park i don't even think i'd leave it open seems like that'd where they'd really go for the big houses really yeah yeah hum Dallas can be pretty bad though yeah i think it depend on the city really yeah i don't know though because i think that way of Lubbock and then uh like i was talking to this girl that lives way out in the country and she was saying how bad it is out there and i would think it would be less uh-huh yeah i would thinking it wouldn't be as bad yeah i guess it just depends because there're certain part of the cities too there's no way i would ever i wouldn't even leave my car alone in south Dallas see i know i know that's scary um i don't know though but i still think like out in the country when she said that i was like what yeah i was like no way and she goes yeah she goes you know people get broken into a lot because they you know it's real easy to get away with there you know no one can see them carrying out the stuff if no one lives nearby yeah i was like well that's true but besides that i don't know and i think it's just getting worse yeah that's what scares me about living out in uh like off in the country i used to live out in the country uh-huh and that kind of scares me because i think you know you always hear about all those murders and it's weird to think about but it happens and that's the scary part i know see i know and i don't like living out in the country i like living in the city where i'm close to there might be more crime or as they say but it just makes me feel safer because i'm around someone yeah that's true because you have neighbors and stuff at least you know yeah if i scream someone's going to hear me i know someone's got to yeah i know that's scary though yeah and it just keeps rising yeah i mean i can't imagine i don't know what's after i've been here so long it's like i well you'd have to pay me to move back to Dallas yeah i mean i don't like now now that i'm away from it and i can look back at how you know Dallas is and stuff yeah i don't like it yeah i don't like it at all really i don't know i think it'd depend on hum i don't know where you live i know that's not right though i think that but i don't think that's really yeah i don't know i guess i'm sure there is a bunch of thieving of thieving going on in Lubbock it's just not around you or not that you know of yeah yeah because i don't know i mean uh a couple of summers ago the people behind us got robbed and you know we were everybody was looking out but ever since like a week after that nobody just even paid any attention any more really see that's sad i would think like car theft is a really big thing yeah yeah yeah wouldn't you yeah i think that or especially here where we have so many cars i know i know everybody in New York takes a cab and we've all got cars see i know i don't know because that's i think car i don't know if that is though that's what that 'd be my guess car theft for sure yeah because i don't burgalies burgurlaries i can't say that burgalies i don't know i don't know if there'd be that i don't know besides people that would be just have like kids that come in and burglarize and take like TVs and stuff that they could sell real easy whereas someone like cleaning you out you know yeah i guess that would depend on it too yeah a friend of mine's house he was gone all summer but he has a house here by himself uh-huh and um his own friends got in and robbed him no way yeah he has this he has this like gorgeous bedroom set and that's the oh my gosh  okay Liz do you have any children i do but they're but they're both out of college so i have one who's uh living in an apartment in another city uh-huh and i have one who's actually living with me because um because of the economy and the job that she's got but she's about oh uh-huh she's on the verge of moving to her own apartment so what about you oh uh-huh well we have five children and uh their ages range from range from twelve to four uh-huh oh little ones then uh yep and uh yeah uh some things we like to do together with our family are um in the summer time we like to go to parks we that's our thing we pack up a picnic and and go to every park from Northern Utah to Southern Utah wow oh you mean like state parks that kind of well mostly mostly just play parks yeah so uh-huh uh-huh um with the with the kids and such we don't get a lot of vacationing in so we just like to take little weekend trips and go to parks and such uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh so you probably have pretty ones there when you were saying parks i was just uh we have a different terrain here so oh uh-huh yep when i was a teenager i spent some time with my cousins in Dallas uh um-hum and so i i remember it's pretty it is flat oh it's flat yes so the mountains would take a while to get around to to find any there are some as a matter of fact but um what other things do the kids like to do uh-huh yeah well we like to like weekends or during during during the winter do they ski or weekends um no we're not into skiing it's just too expensive we it is expensive yeah we can't do that so um we like to uh rent videos and sit down and have a video bash pop popcorn and yeah um-hum hm yeah that's fun and do that so we've done that quite a bit this winter and um we like to play board games together sometimes it's a little difficult with the younger one um yes that's but the three older boys we have some fun times with those after the little girls go to bed um-hum um-hum and let's see uh we like to get real wild and crazy and play hide and go seek and oh yeah things like that all of those things yeah well the twelve year old probably feels he or she's much older than the four year old so there should be different activities in in their minds at at any rate yeah oh yes yeah yeah he's really patient though he with us he's he's a real fun twelve year old so well that's good but he's rapidly approaching teenagehood so we'll see what happens uh-huh your first experience with it well it um it's interesting there's a dramatic change at thirteen and it doesn't end until about twenty five but yeah uh-huh oh oh boy it's part of what's supposed to happen or they can't fly the nest so um that's that's one way of looking at it anyway i was trying to think what what what we spent a lot of time well reading i loved to read to the kids when they were when they were younger uh obviously not any more but oh oh uh-huh uh-huh and uh we still we like um Disney movies we really got into them when they were young there were a number of movies that we liked and we just simply liked the experience of the movies and um oh uh-huh ironically uh my twenty seven my twenty four and my twenty two year old last year for Christmas we rented um Jungle Book you know oh how fun and uh i gave one of them Jungle Book and one of them Fantasia for Christmas this year and it was one of their favorite gifts so oh oh i think that's fun so that's something and besides the another thing we used to do is watch PBS together which there were a lot of um my son loves science programs and um oh oh yeah we would all just stop and watch whatever the mountain lions were doing or whatever was going on yes i think that is good that sounds yeah which was which was fun yeah and so uh-huh now were you able to get away on some vacations and yeah we did and um and we enjoyed that um my now we my kids back when they were younger younger got did we would go from here to like Colorado and ski oh oh how fun and they did both uh learn to be scuba divers oh uh we went once on a vacation with my parents to an island and they snorkeled and that that really got them you know fascinated with the deep and so they actually went through all the course and all the trouble in the middle of Missouri as we were living in Kansas City then oh how fun uh-huh oh wow and uh went and i don't can't remember what it's called uh but it's  uh well it's nice to talk with you um oh i guess i'll go ahead and start off with uh i think that there's two things that could be done that are procedural to uh to help the budget the first i believe in would be to give the president a line item veto um i agree with that uh i think that a lot of times the the members of congress uh when they're faced with uh the possibility of having to to cut jobs in their district by because of shutting down a federal project or something just don't have the the willpower on their own to uh to make the tough decisions and sometimes it would be best to give that over to the president who who has overall responsibility for the whole country and can uh i guess be a little bit more insulated from from uh the concerns of one of one district local politics yeah well also too often too the uh individual congressman has the uh especially if they are on on uh some of the committees that put these budgets together uh have the opportunity to slide things in that normally should not have gone in at all and the line yeah and the line item uh veto would be ideal for that i mean to yeah that's exactly right yeah one of the the uh there's a bill pending before congress which i'm trying to remember what it's called it's something like the pork buster bill that um if approved would make it uh uh uh you wouldn't be able to um put in uh new projects and things in a conference committee or at anytime where they weren't reviewed by the regular committee that has responsibility for that and that's like what you were talking about where they slip things in at the last minute yeah and the conference committee is really the worst place for that to happen uh because no one uh uh has uh it doesn't go back into the regular committee for review after the conference committee it just goes back to the house and the senate for a final up or down vote on the whole thing yeah yeah there's another idea uh uh another uh way where the budget could uh probably benefit and this has to do of course uh it has to do with federal projects too often uh those are uh not there's no uh accountability once the uh projects are awarded to make sure that the quality is done and they end up getting stuck with billions of dollars of overlay or if contracts are put out uh no one uh is responsible or it does does not seem to be for following up that if it goes over budget it it well you know it's set up laissez faire attitude well that's to be expected we just sort of built it in well that shouldn't happen that way i agree and i think i think if there was more attention paid to uh what's being uh spent and more accountability that would help enormous enormously too are um-hum how who or how that would come about i'm not uh sure but that's an an an area that i think needs to be uh looked at yeah it it really sometimes seems that there is there's nobody out there uh watching out for uh for we the people and making sure that the money is spent wisely uh and i don't know that just sort of seems to be unfortunately part of the just how the system uh operates now uh we gee is there anything specific that you think uh uh in the way of federal programs or whatever that would be eliminated to try to cut federal spending well i think uh there could be a lot of consolidation of programs uh looking at of course there they have been a lot of talk to begin with but looking at and the the military's a big uh area that uh has taken a lot of shots recently but i i do not see the point of having four different services uh i do not see why they could not have one military service and just eliminate all that high level bureaucracy that's right because a lot of the monies are spent uh with insiding within those departments how do you feel about bringing home all of our troops from Europe and the Far East and letting Germany and Japan defend themselves uh basically i'm in i'm in agreement with that yeah uh i would think that there probably needs to be a uh monitor or not a monitor uh or courtesy you know yeah a presence but not a well we'll always have a presence there but we don't we don't need to have half a million troops overseas no well witness witness the the recent Gulf War too even with uh troops all over Europe uh it took several months to gear up that's right and so what was the point of having them to begin with um-hum yeah another area that's that i really think ought to be cut is is direct uh foreign aid  okay um what does your does your community do anything about recycling we have been working hard to get a program of recycling going um-hum the best we've been able to do is an area that has uh storage bins uh for um bottles and uh plastic um um-hum but people need to drive it there we don't we haven't moved to having uh picked up with the garbage yet right Plano um oh it's probably been i guess i started in September um started where they gave every every household a bin that you could do newspapers aluminum uh bottles with code one and two on them and uh glass and uh it has been really really successful um they said that they figured like twenty five to thirty percent participation and it's been like forty five percent and um they also do um they pick up on another day of the week for um lawn debris that could go in like a big compost here uh they don't take uh lawn debris to the landfill any more we need to load it into cars and take it to a general site where it gets recycled uh but um-hum i think they're they're not making it easy for the uh general public to do it here i mean they they you have to haul everything yourself which can be a mess when it comes to uh yard waste in particular right right how big is your community well we've got enough people we've got a community of about eighty five thousand yeah but they're just very reluctant to to get moving the way in which i would like to see them moving um-hum the i yeah that's i i would like to see the manufacturers really uh you know the only thing that they recycle right now is is plastics one and two and i would like to see them recycle either more plastics um you know up to code seven or eight whatever it is or see the manufacturers using more of the um uh code one and two that i i mean i don't even know of a place to drop off the other the other ones um did did did you tell me that you're recycling newspapers but um we're recycling newspapers aluminum um i mean like aluminum cans like soup cans and all that not just you know soda pop cans um glass and uh the plastics boy you're you're further ahead here most people are recycling aluminum soda pop and beer cans uh for the money that they get out of them and that seems to be the only incentive on that side right it sure does take a lot of lot of cans to do that that to make anything though at least down here it i i took like two garbage sacks full i mean just like paper sacks and got like a quarter and i thought this just really isn't worth my time yeah it really is but there are a few people who who so that that go through the dregs yeah they will manage it what we've done at the church is to have uh people bring the stuff to our church yeah um-hum and then there're couple of people who who crunch them down and then uh take them to a recycling center and then the money is used for uh the outreach program to provide food um-hum that's great and so that has been an incentive uh within uh our our particular church yeah but newspapers the city doesn't want and none of the uh recycling places want them because they say that they're it costs them more to recycle than than they get out of them so we're stuck with newspapers yeah really really we we i know uh even before this took place um in September the our like our boy scouts were doing paper you know paper drives and even when i was younger um i remember having paper drives at school and um so i know it it seems like for you know a long time the the Dallas area has been doing some kind of paper recycling i don't know what they did with the papers you know twenty thirty years ago i'm not sure but i know now i mean we have a lot of um stores Wal-Mart is down real big down here and and their their paper sacks that they do are all you know out of recycled paper and we have a lot of lot of companies  okay um Chuck do you have any pets there at your home yeah i do and what kind do you have i've got a male Siamese about a year old here i live alone in an apartment and uh oh uh-huh except for the cat how about you uh-huh well we have a cat um he's probably oh a good two years old big old fat and sassy tabby uh-huh oh uh how's the disposition of your Siamese cat well it's uh you know they're just uh aggressive by nature uh-huh and uh he's been neutered and declawed so and he's an indoor cat so uh uh-huh uh that kind of calms him down for the most part and uh well yeah he's uh he has been really aggressive at especially towards my little girl for some reason he's uh how about yours huh been so mean to her and and and you say you had him how long we've had him for about two years and and he was so mean to her two years um right after we first got him so we had him neutered and and declawed and now he bites her he can't scratch her anymore he bites her huh does he bite her enough to draw blood yeah yeah he has a couple of times so uh-huh but he's a very possessive cat he he loves my son it's his cat and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him yeah and he's so funny he just follows my son around just like a dog huh he won't even let my son shower he meows and wants to get in the bathroom and while he showers it's so hilarious yeah so he's quite a animal yeah boy i guess well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive i guess with the daughter he's all right you wouldn't want him to carry her off or something yeah yeah well we we did uh actually take him to the pound a couple of times you know because we just couldn't have him being so uh-huh sure aggressive towards the girl but uh he seems to have mellowed out a little bit and we do keep our daughter away from him so yeah yeah were it not for my son the cat would not be in this house is that the only pet that you have it is uh-huh we've we tried a dog um about four years ago and we ended up with a oh Malamute and some other kind of mix anyway it was it ended up being just a huge huge dog that ate us out of house and home so we gave him up and tried well do you live you you in a house or a place where you uh yes uh-huh we're in a house but we're in a subdivision where we really can't allow the dog we couldn't allow him to run free so he was just chained up all the time and it was it was unfortunate yeah i see sure so have you tried any other pets no no i i live alone in an apartment and uh it's it's not that big that uh although i've heard rabbits are pretty good oh oh you know i i saw something on CNN or on cable here uh uh-huh a while ago that showed some people that had rabbits in apartments oh my word and in houses and they apparently uh especially when they're young when they bring them in uh oh my word and do they they just paper train it or something i guess i guess yeah and i would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with either because uh yeah well rabbits are darling that would be fun if you could get them trained otherwise they're pretty smelly um yeah yep that's right did you see the the CNN the the dog show uh huh-uh we don't have CNN we don't have cable they i see well they have uh uh a Westminster they call it the Westminster Dog Show uh uh i think it's in New York City at the at the Gardens there once a year live oh and they had that on last week and that's really kind of something to watch uh it's on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two oh is that right oh and uh some of the weirdest animals you ever wanna see on there some of them are really beautiful too yeah so uh uh-huh well that would be interesting to watch yeah so you live in Utah do you yes uh-huh Elton we live out here by it's by Ogden it's north of Salt Lake City Utah goodness uh-huh and we really love it out here it's uh kind of country we're we're only about ten minutes from Ogden uh-huh so we're kind of country but not too well do you all work for TI or or not no huh-uh do you yeah yeah yeah oh well see i'm getting so many calls to Texas this is the very first one i've i've talked to you know oh well great yeah i've been doing it for about two weeks and uh no my uh-huh  i pressed i pressed one all right uh on uh all right benefits benefits and um for the uh benefits of working for a large corporation i found the biggest i do work for one now and the biggest benefit is that uh there's a little more in backup when i need it do you work outside of the home yes i do i work for the school system Richardson school oh that's a pretty large corporation yes it is and uh retirement's one of the good benefits um-hum and um health care has been a mess no yeah and that can be with a large corporation it used to be but i think that's a mess for everybody now isn't it pretty much yeah it keeps changing because they they have to keep shopping around it keeps i yes for the best where it used to be one of your better you know you you got the whole package with your larger companies and you didn't have that problem um-hum yeah do you like working for a large school system compared to a small one yes i think i do i've never worked for a small one so i can't tell you you know but yes i believe the benefits and the pay is much better than you would get in a smaller system um-hum well i think uh course i'm i'm a medical technologist and and in our line of work it's awfully nice to not be out by yourself and that's the biggest benefit i find right um because um you have more backup and more people to call on with problems that may arise and uh um-hum um-hum um-hum of course uh you know it uh it varies with the situations right right do you have good resources in your school district right we do have very good resources they're excellent yeah to my mind that's the best thing for working for a big place and they're um is how about you how do you feel about that well it's an important aspect of it i feel you know it is it it is an important aspect as far as um being having having everything available to you um-hum the uh counseling and the whole whole ball of wax um um-hum what would you like to change in your benefits right well probably the major one would be the medical um-hum i would like to change see a better package for the money you know it but but i guess we all would and they keep cutting us from the you know they keep cutting from the yeah do you have to pay medical into the dental is so expensive where we used to get it and you used to get the eyes and the whole thing and you don't get any of that any more you know it's all separate and it's all so very high if you do get it um-hum um-hum yeah well ours is and that's very frustrating and it i can't imagine how the younger families do it well it's it's difficult yeah i know uh ours has improved over what it was because we just went to a larger corporation and that's what helped it improve but um-hum um-hum the one thing i'd like to see in our profession is our retirement benefits are almost pathetic um-hum so that's how i'd like to improve ours um-hum i was i was just going to say the retirement is fair for teachers but my husband has retirement too and it's not good though we've had to i mean we're building our own you know oh well you have to you have to any more you can't count on companies on that any more that and that's another thing that's changed the the medical and the uh-huh you have to if you're smart hum-um retirement benefits from large corporations it's kind of it's it's like it was set you know you were really set for life really um-hum well in the large corporations the one the thing you have to be so careful of now is being cut when you are almost at retirement age and uh uh-huh yeah yep yep that's right right before yeah and that's that's kind of rough that's yeah i remember um my mother talking in the forties for her her father was cut you know they went through this same thing in the forties that they're doing now they were cutting men at forty five and fifty years old and that's what they're doing again it's like a recycle of the whole um-hum um-hum um-hum when they see they're gonna have to pay all those benefits and all or it's getting close to a time yeah yeah it happens they bring in they bring in the younger blood that they don't have to pay as high and yeah but uh course i think they're losing an awful lot of valuable expertise oh i do too and the wisdom behind it all it's yeah and you know that's got to count that's got to add in all their production the whole works um-hum i used to to be in actual management and hiring and we figured it cost us probably at least a thousand dollars on each turn off and rehire um-hum yeah because of all the paperwork and different departments that had to work on it yeah yeah it was uh it's expensive and i don't know why they don't build that into it but i guess well it's cost again um-hum you know cutting costs  okay uh it's Clinton right yeah it's Clint uh-huh Clint okay as in Clint Black right right is it a hobby for you or do you get serious about it um i'm pretty serious it's a serious hobby i guess do you have a lot of nice tools table saws things like like that um i'd like more but yeah i'm getting up there i just have a used table saw right now i'm looking at getting a better one but it's just an old Sears Craftsman do you do any remodeling of your house or what kind of woodworking do you enjoy uh mostly fine woodworking furniture type stuff um enjoy the children's toys hum i like making those yeah so it's basically smaller stuff have you done much big stuff the the big stuff's what i do the the stuff you do is the the intricate work um working with hardwoods and and stuff like that is i i'm lousy at that i mess it up every time right you do kitchen cabinets and stuff no no no even that that's that's i still mess up when i um i guess i really don't do much actual wood working uh i do a lot of carpentry stuff um uh finishing basements and rooms and things of that nature but it's uh-huh finish finish carpentry or i i do do a little bit of finish carpentry but not very much i don't not very much not not like the stuff that you're doing uh-huh um when i took shop classes in high school it was a lot of fun using the lathe and doing some fancy stuff with that course you can't mess things up on the lathe hardly no but uh yeah i got a i just finished a project one of those um swinging cradles uh-huh and i turned all the spindles for that and that took a long time but it was pretty fun i'll bet was it hard woods you were using in it yeah oak uh-huh that's really hard to turn uh-huh but and make it look nice it is yeah had to fill a lot of chip marks up but it really chips really easy uh-huh do you work with oak much uh not at all not at all no pine and redwood and like i say i'm i'm really not a carpenter per se i'm a not at all or a wood worker i'm a carpenter i guess is and i'm really not even a carpenter i just but i enjoy it i do a lot of it uh-huh yeah that's i tried it for a job once and it's just not for me i like it as a hobby more it it's tough uh tough to make a living isn't it boy it sure is i just enjoy making gifts and doing small stuff on the side do you sell any so you do do some sales when you yeah yeah once in a while i'll sell some um custom custom type wood work if they're willing to pay the price now i used to get ripped off all the time because i spent way too much time on them um do you do cabinets too um i'm starting to i used that's what i did for a job one summer i made some cabinets for a junior high school and but i haven't done a lot of them uh-huh is it hard wood when you use when you what kind of hard wood do you use i use oak face frames and then just plywood for the box that plywood that's got the oak uh do you use that a lot where it's just you know what maybe a quarter inch or even thinner than that possibly piece of oak that's on the outside do you use that a lot the yeah the just on the outside where it shows yeah just slip it into a groove that you make on the face frame uh-huh and then you can just slip that in there it's a lot cheaper of course quarter inch and three quarter inch aren't much cheaper than each other um-hum of plywood uh-huh but and then they just have an oak face on them yeah just a are they ready to uh i guess finish or do you have to do anything for to the plywood yeah i just finish sand it just like with one fifty yeah um-hum and then you can finish it up so do you have a workshop or are you using the garage or um just the garage i wish i had a workshop but the stuff i do i i don't need a lot of room for it and your wife puts up with that uh she puts up with me buying the tools she likes wood she likes me wood working but uh-huh huh getting the equipment i want sure is taken a lot of years i started when i was about sixteen buying my own equipment um and i only need a few more things like a joiner i'd like to have and small some smaller things expensive you can get a lot of money in that kind of stuff especially the good stuff oh man everytime we yeah i just bought a a sprayer to finish my project um a high volume low pressure sprayer air uh air uh air pressure it's a high volume low pressure they're new sprayers that are coming out huh really little over spray is is is it electric or air it's air it only sprays with three PSI um but uh the cubic feet per minute of air flow is up to ninety and so that's what that's what gives you your thrust of your paint um um do you do how much how much does that cost you it was five hundred bucks is that right gee and that was just for the gun that wasn't for the compressor anything  well uh i don't know i think the budget is really out of hand right now and especially in this election year i think that uh there ought to be some at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this um-hum yeah see it like seems to me you know that everyone's offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when it's when it's just such a bad time for it you know right right and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts uh especially what for instance George Bush is offering no it the ninety seven cents a week yeah ninety seven cents a week now what that's really not gonna do a lot of good it doesn't seem to me to your average middle income person you know another ninety seven cents hell you can buy a Coke or something for that uh-huh hell i mean mostly you know it's it's not actually a a a cut it's just a cut in the with hold in the amount with held you know yeah um yeah i don't just don't see it changing my life style a whole lot nah that ninety seven cents really isn't gonna do it for me either uh um-hum i i haven't really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that has made a lot of sense to me either especially the Democratic candidates uh don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could do something to affect our budget at this point um-hum yeah i mean you know in in retrospect um was it was it Mondale or Dukakis that said you know i'll i'll tell you right now i'm gonna raise taxes i believe it was Dukakis but i i can't it was Dukakis yeah i have a lot of respect for him yeah i mean that's better than George Bush who came out and said no i will not read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i can't follow through on this but it seems to me that uh yeah um-hum um-hum that the budget is so out of hand and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of X number of billion trillion dollars a year well i'd really like to know where where that money is actually gonna go because um-hum in my opinion i don't think i'm ever gonna see any of this peace so called peace dividend oh yeah i know it it's i mean if they could actually put put something together and make i'm not really in favor of large government social programs either because i feel that they waste money also but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works um-hum um-hum projects like they had in the thirties or whatever oh yeah i i i i i think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where it would it would it would help unemployment greatly right exactly exactly and in that way we could really focus on building the infrastructure structure of the country and it yeah our infrastructure is in is in i mean we we've we've hurt ourselves incredibly over the last fifty fifty years of the cold war yeah yeah and and there's no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that we're in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infrastructure and i surely don't hear anybody saying that right now um-hum um-hum um yeah i i agree totally um i mean we this this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen um i i'm in college right now and oh really where do you go so am i uh IU right i go to Georgia Tech um and in my i had political you know the required political science class a couple of years ago uh-huh um-hum and one of the things we discussed was you know were where the budget situation how how the budget situation just got so out of hand and essentially what happened was and i think it was like in eighty in the um tax year of eighty one um right Ronald Reagan basically said you know i'm gonna give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um that the Congress would not in the right mind pass and Congress Congress realizing that they were gonna lose a the Democratic Congress realizing that they were gonna lose a propaganda war you know by by you know slicing by by removing the tax cut right uh-huh further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know what created the the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit right and you just i mean it's just you you just have to wonder what they're thinking in Washington i mean it's just like you know playing chicken with a loaded gun yeah uh well it's it's more than a loaded it's a loaded cannon i mean they've got trillions of dollars to spend every year and they in my opinion don't do a very responsible job of spending that money yeah um-hum well yeah and what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well i'm gonna raise taxes and cut the budget and we're gonna have you know we're we're gonna we're gonna have to do some unpopular things i mean he wouldn't have a chance of getting elected oh no i mean it's kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where where people just want want to have uh-huh you know what ever will make them feel good right now you know and for the for the moment and that's what really is getting me about what George Bush's stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am gonna give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that you'll be happy come November and you'll elect me again um-hum um-hum and then i'm gonna go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it doesn't seem that it's gonna make much of a difference um-hum um-hum yeah that i mean i don't know i i i don't i don't think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety seven cents a week no no not at all well i just don't think it was a well thought out incentive no  so Martin how do you feel about crime in the city uh you said you're from Atlanta right i i i actually i live in the city and uh i guess it is a concern of mine uh um-hum you know for my own safety um-hum i mean do you find do you find crime in Atlanta really bad i mean i live in Atlanta also oh that's right um uh-huh uh i think it is bad in certain areas however i think uh the area that i live in it's not uh the the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the of the city i think it seems that there's certain certain areas where uh the crime is focused um um-hum um-hum well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city well i think it's what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols trying to put put more guys more cops higher visibility um-hum and uh it had some impact but not a tremendous amount and probably um they need to try to increase community involvement that sort of thing i think's the best way there is i'd probably agree with that yeah you know uh particularly in some of the housing projects uh uh you know that's that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused and they've got to do more than just having having cops there they've got to kind of change the way people think about it um-hum yeah that's probably true um so do um well do you think Atlanta is as bad as most other cities um well i've been to i'd say it's it's probably in the top top ten in terms of crime um it's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example probably not not as bad as Detroit um-hum um-hum i don't think it's as bad as LA either no we i don't think we don't we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have yeah that seems to be true um yeah if you've ever been to like New York City and um-hum you can just you can just as you walk through the street on a given evening you can see crimes being committed it's that obvious um-hum yeah i know i've i've come to the conclusion also that you know just if you are walking in a downtown area you know where where there's a lot of crime a lot of that's gonna just just keeping your senses about you and you know trying not to look like a victim you know yeah that's true you know walk with you know walk with you know with with a big stick or well not silly just walk you know confidently and you know don't don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are right sure right don't don't walk down a an alley or don't get just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation but yeah there are times when you can't avoid all that um and and then you're kind of yeah um-hum um-hum on your own yeah and if you have you ever have you ever been mugged in Atlanta uh no the only thing i've ever had is i've had my wallet lifted um-hum but that was in a more of a a a setting where there was a number of people around and i kind of got i was much younger at the time and kind of a couple of people they just took it from me without me knowing really um-hum um-hum and kind of passed it off so i didn't know who had it um-hum i've had that happen but that's that's about it yeah i've been pretty lucky about getting mugged i don't oh yeah yeah i think i've only actually seen like one you know one actual robbery with a gun hum and that's been about the only you know real violent crime where you know potentially violent crime that i've seen in Atlanta and that and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed really well i've had my um-hum i've had my car stolen so maybe that counts oh really yeah wow where was where where was that was that downtown or oh no that was in the northern part um up near Cumberland Mall area it's actually Cobb County but it is Atlanta really um-hum metropolitan yeah and uh there's a lot of car thefts in that area yeah i've i've actually i've known known some people that have had their cars stolen um and uh and uh you know but half the time they seem to the APD seems to recover them you know in in various states of disrepair up on blocks you know my friend who had a um right yeah yeah VW Rabbit and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in in his front seat yeah mine was just it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage but they didn't they didn't strip it um-hum so i got it back well you're probably luckier than yeah than most um-hum um so does like insurance pay for the body damage or was that was that all it was body right it it was about three grand to put everything together they cracked the steering column of course to steal the car oh yeah you've got to you crack the steering column then you pull the there's a pin in there that you can pull on these GM cars and you can start start it up basically pretty easily um-hum um-hum so how do you know this much about um stealing cars well after i found mine i had to i had this  okay now it's Sandy right all right yeah Sandy um what kind of music do you like to listen to i like Country and it's really hard to find people that enjoy country music uh-huh in San Diego uh-huh in my age because i'm twenty two and most people my age like hard rock and uh-huh not me i think it was the stupidest thing ever invented oh i still like country music and do you oh so it's kind of hard for me to find people i agree with on music oh um now have you lived in California all your life oh no no you just moved there i i have to be here right now because my husband's in the Navy oh but i'm going home first opportunity i get now where's home Arizona oh okay so country music is prevalent in Arizona oh yeah i i was born in a little tiny town that that's all they have is it oh oh it has a population of about three hundred people and all they know is country music i mean they still have barn dances and stuff oh how fun oh yeah it is pretty fun oh gosh i don't blame you uh my husband's in the Navy Reserves and so he's going out to San Diego in about three weeks for his two week oh really yearly stint so i'll be missing him then but yeah my husband's leaving March twelfth he has to go out to sea again oh and how long does he stay out so well usually they stay out six to nine months but this time they're only going out for i think it's two weeks this time because they're just they're just doing their sea trials making sure they're ready to go out to sea again oh oh well thank goodness uh-huh oh i think that's terrible oh yeah it gets kind of monotonous yeah but i incorporated him into country music because he didn't he didn't like it when we got married but since he married me and i was the country girl that's all i have going on at home uh-huh uh-huh oh so now he's gotten where he really likes country music and for my birthday he went out and he got me a brand new pair of Tony Llama boots and he bought himself a pair too and took me out country dancing uh uh-huh oh boy so he is real country now yeah and all his friends tease him on the ship are you sure cowboys know how to swim he he gets upset about it but it's funny that is that is well out here in Utah we have a lot of country and we live kind of in the country it's by Ogden Utah i don't know if you know Salt Lake City my my dad lives in Salt Lake oh yeah well it's it's about a hour north of Salt Lake so we're out here in the country and we hear a lot of the country music yeah in fact i work in a bakery and the baker comes to work at four o'clock in the morning and i come to work at six o'clock in the morning and he just has the country music just a blasting and he just rocks and rolls in the bakery to country music yeah i know how that goes i think country music's the only thing keeping me sane with these kids oh i i bet that's really hard being their alone with all those with the two little ones yeah yeah it is but i don't know it's worth it way it's a way of life for a while huh it's worth it to me yeah that's good well um my favorite kind of music is New Age and it's that sounds like it's hard rock and roll but it's not it's the oh the synthesizers synsi synthesizers and all of that yeah and it kind of has a bluesy mix to it yeah uh-huh and it's just beautiful i love it i i find it so relaxing and i do i'm getting beginning to like country music more and more since my boss has it on all the time but um but my very favorite is that New Age i like my favorite recording artist is Yanni and he's not he doesn't make you yawn he yeah do you know who Mariah Carey is um i have yeah i've heard of her in fact i was watching the Grammy's and i i saw her on the Grammy's i don't particularly like her kind of music but she's got a couple songs that i i i can listen to uh-huh uh-huh you know without going totally bonkers yeah she's not too wild yeah but i don't know i just i guess i'm kind of the only country one that got left oh because most people here most of the bars and everything are either hard rock or disco or um just a blues bar we've got several blues bars in the neighborhood neighborhood oh yeah uh-huh and it's like uh guys what happened to juke boxes and sawdust on the floor you know yeah and i i asked that of a i went into a bar with my husband on our anniversary and i asked the guy i said have you ever heard of a a juke box and he goes yeah uh-huh i said why don't you install one he goes what music do you want on it and i said country and he goes no way i'd lose all my clients and i'm like thanks oh oh oh oh  ever had a family reunion yes we have several um do you do extended families or we do extended families have you do you have you participated in a family reunion yeah yes um in the last couple of years i've the last one we had was in September and um i helped plan it so and it was here in Dallas so um um i i know that when we've had ours they set a date and they have them every um year and it's mostly on my mom's side of the family that does it but um but um uh-huh yeah they send out invitations and it's the very same weekend of every year and it's in July and they always bring um family history information and they have the Saturday is all tied um involved in people getting together um going over there's all these tables set up and they've got all this family history that you can get uh-huh information on different people and their childhood and pictures and put together your own history of your family and your ancestors and that's really fun and then on Sunday they um um-hum they have a big dinner and everyone's supposed to bring something and it's more of just a time to just chat and get you know reacquainted with your cousins and yeah and things like that that's the very big extended one that's over two hundred people that go to that oh wow yeah that we've done um so we went to one that was my husband's grandfather and his brothers and sisters and then their families so we that was kind of nice i don't know that they had done one um in a long long time and so it was real nice to get to to know other people than his just aunts and uncles right and so that was really fun and um we did that in Florida but there were still only maybe oh seventy or eighty people there but they did they did a lot of um we had we had several get togethers like Saturday was or Friday night we started with dinner Saturday we had lunch together and took like family pictures and went over family history and then um that night we had some free time in there and then that night was um oh it was more it was a it was a nice dinner and then they had you went around the room and said who you were and maybe something about yourself and you know how you related in the family and stuff and that was kind of nice because we'd been talking to these people all day long and then it was okay now where do you fit in in the in the line and stuff and who's who's are you kind of thing right but um i know on more of a smaller scale my husband's mother and father have boughten a condominium that's in a ski resort in Utah um-hum um and um they have it a certain week each year that's set aside for the whole family to come home yeah in July and um everybody tries to go there and stay it's two or three big condominiums that all hook together and so everybody tries to go up and stay and yeah um all be together on his in his immediate family but there were seven children and by the time you get their spouses and their children all there yeah there're six in my family and i don't i don't think of them as family reunions so much but either either Thanksgiving or Christmas where for sure everyone is there and and uh so that's you know by the time you get the kids and all that there's there's a good number of us there and um right but we usually just eat and and play games and you know chitchat but um we had a my grandmother's side of of the family we had a get together last year and that was really fun because uh uh as cousins we stay real close together and um so but we did things like um went to the tea we went and had tea at the um oh one of the hotels downtown in downtown Dallas and then uh-huh Friday night if if you wanted to go you could go to the Mesquite Rodeo and then Saturday it was we had a big family picnic and we had T-shirts that you know said family reunion and had gave the year and um wore those to the picnic and we had some stuff for the kids and there was a it was there was a wading pool there that if the kids wanted to go swimming they could do that and if the guys wanted to go golf they could do that and stuff and then Saturday night was our big big dinner and and we had it catered and it for most of the part it was catered and it was really nice to be able to send we sent out stuff this is this is what's available to do and it it you know the big family dinner is going to be Saturday night you need to make a reservation and pay us ahead of time because the year before we had done it and uh had had problems getting the money yeah you know the the yeah i mean it's like pass the hat around and it didn't i don't think they broke even at all and uh which is i mean i can't imagine feeding two hundred like right  oh how's your products been um i really haven't had uh too many problems uh seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out i hear that one have you had any lately go out yeah i've had a dryer an ice maker a microwave all three and they unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time when i bought my new house and uh i really don't have any recourse so i had to call and have them all repaired and that oh wow yeah it was a hassle so you didn't get anything even all the all the warranties were out yeah the warranty on the refrigerator uh the ice the refrigerator warranty's still good but the ice maker itself lasted three years and it was three years and two months you're kidding yeah we just moved into a new house too so we had to buy all those too no uh watch out yeah the only thing i've had problems with is um i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail and um-hum i bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings so hm i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than i just ended up using it but that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong i usually have pretty good luck with appliances but i just uh it was within two days that all three of these stopped working and the that's incredible the ice maker was uh had to have a new pump and the uh microwave had to have uh some kind of something i can't even pronounce and they uh the dryer had to have a new heating element so it was about almost three hundred dollars for all three of them and they all went out at the same time uh within two days of each other or two days wow i was it wasn't a good week i was pretty mad and plus the place that i'd bought um them all had gone out of business so even if uh i think even if i had uh had kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies that that manufactured but still they were through that retailer so i don't know if i could've taken it to another retailer or not wow that's frustrating but i didn't have to worry about all that because they weren't under warranty so it was a call to the local appliance dealer uh-huh who came out and fixed them all but i the only other things that i've ever had trouble with um i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers blow dryers uh-huh they go out a lot yeah i've had two or three of those go out one was under warranty and the other two weren't but i just other than that you know TVs and things like that i haven't ever had any trouble with i don't think products are getting much better though yeah see i'm in the manufacturing field i just home from work and make um automotive air bags the safety air bags oh really that's interesting yeah at Morton International and i think well it's it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment we test everything after each assembly process and so our testing is pretty thorough but do you do you test each individual one or do you just test um like if you've got ten you test one and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay um the tests that well we test every one electrically we don't i think they test um four or five a day actually exploding the air bag um-hum and but we do test after during the assembly project product um after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag we check to make sure it's there after we install it so each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done and then we do electrical tests on them during the process so well that's something i've never had to use it's never i've never been involved in an automobile accident so luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test but i think it's a great idea i'm i'm yeah seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to to come about but that well they do the all the testing that we have to do through the government it's incredible how much testing they have to do oh i'm sure they wanna be thorough before they but uh even you know i don't mind spending the extra money on the car uh-huh if you know even if they pass the savings the cost onto the consumer because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing i'm not a real big seat belt my uh  um so what do you think of um the way that the government has has moved towards you know getting involved in people's individual uh lives well uh i did did have you ever heard of a man named Milton Friedman um yeah he's a commentator isn't he yeah well no no he actually wasn't he he's an he was uh he's an anti government type uh fellow he's not really a commentator i don't i don't believe uh-huh uh-huh uh but he wrote several books years ago and and he put out like ten different movies on government and and uh and i'm a Milton kind of a Milton Friedman fan and he's anti big government and that's that's my feeling about it i think our government is way too big um uh-huh that there's just a tremendous amount of waste i'm i'm a CPA and i can i see the way they uh butcher people as far as i'm concerned and uh uh-huh uh-huh in in in the in the tax end of it as as far as how they they and so do you sort of lean towards like the libertarian view take money from them you bet i do yep uh-huh something interesting to me right now too is this presidential campaign uh i i can't believe how uh-huh tax you you know our money our life really centers around money the whole thing and you can see uh how uh-huh tax laws uh in new legislation right now are really a critical big issue yeah and it means a horrible time to have tax cuts at this point uh-huh i think you know as far at least as far as our deficit's concerned uh-huh you know and everyone and every all the candidates just seem to be you now have this bread and circuses policy of you know we'll give you a dollar a day if you vote for us you know that's that's right yeah yeah i mean your kids won't be happy but uh-huh you'll be able to buy that that extra six pack of beer at the end of the week right the deficit the country's in right now is just incredible i heard a statistic the other day i don't know if this is wrong or right uh-huh but for every man woman and child in the United States they're in debt uh about forty thousand dollars a piece i have a family of five if i had if i had to pay that much responsible for that much debt uh-huh i'd be done i'd be sunk uh-huh you know i just i there's no way i can generate the income to service that kind of debt i don't know what the heck our government's going to do one time um i i really personally think we're going to have to collapse just like the Soviet Union did or uh i i don't know how how how can we it really wouldn't surprise me if that happens in the next twenty years yeah right i don't see it in the near future but uh um and we we are still considered the best credit risk in the world yeah because we write off debts we loaned the Mexican government five hundred million dollars or whatever and forgave them supposedly uh-huh that's the same thing with what happened over there um in i and i believe it was Turkey We wanted to use their air strips during the Persian Gulf uh-huh so we just went over there and said gee guys you owe us all this money well i tell you let us land our planes here and we'll just forgive it uh-huh that's ridiculous uh-huh and and i don't know if that's really the case you know i'm talking all out of hearsay and conversation from what i've heard uh from other from from other some of my other associates but that wouldn't surprise yeah maybe i would we we've been known to spend a lot of money for expediency in things i uh um what do you think about the Japanese and the comments they've made recently about the American people i'm not sure that's uh actually a political issue but uh well it in it um i think if anyone but the Japanese had made it if if if an American had said the same thing people probably would have agreed with them that's true and i'm not so sure they're all that wrong oh yeah yeah yeah um you know we we we our companies are have definitely become top heavy uh-huh um in management um you know our we you know we we you know you know the trend of over consumption since World War Two um you know theory being that that's what what what would be required to make our economy to thrive the best you know that that we you know that the workers just been given that just moved for better and better standards of living and where a bunch of other factors i think you know is just you know it's it's uh we're we're unable to keep on increasing that you know when when you know when you combine with the mismanagement that a lot of American companies have had and yeah i think that you know that's really when he says that they were lazy i think lazy probably wasn't the best term to use but i think you know you know unwilling unwilling you know unwilling the American workers probably are not willing to do as much work for as little as other country's workers are right  okay um i guess we're going to talk describe uh job benefits and so what do you think next to salary do you rank is the most important job benefits uh i would say the medical uh group insurance uh area as far as uh uh-huh covering medical costs for yourself or family members um-hum well um does your company have good benefits in that in that regard yeah i think i work for a a public school system district and uh so it's different than a company where uh-huh most companies fund almost the entire thing where the school district does um the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of uh costs but overall um i've been pleased with it over the years i think the biggest frustration oh yeah um-hum is because of the cost of insurance going up every year our district has had to alter uh you know change companies or now we're on a managed care thing which has stressed a lot of people out although hm it has not disturbed me any how about yourself i see uh well i'm my medical coverage is with an HMO um so uh-huh that's in my opinion that's getting that's bordering on a health clinic but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage um right yeah our district did that for the ninety one and the ninety school year or calendar years and i was in the HMO and um i i was because my my same doctor you know agreed to be in it for uh they usually sign a contract or something and um um-hum uh i did have surgery last summer and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day and i've never seen another bill so i i have to say it really works but again right i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it uh if you've been going to a doctor for you know ten years or something and he elects not to join it can be very stressful for you know those people yes that's right yeah i'm i'm fairly young myself i've only been when i first started working which three years ago is when i first got into full time employment uh-huh and uh at that time i immediately joined the HMO and i never really so the only doctor i i've kind of consistently had has been through the HMO and uh you know for me it's worked out real good yeah right but if you you know have a family and and um everybody's gone to different doctors uh it is hard to give up somebody who you feel knows you and your body and your just has you know all the medical history and you feel comfortable with it i i'm sure it would be very stressful and um-hum my husband and i have just elected that if that happens i will go and just pay you can continue to go to your own doctor but your benefits are not as hm you know good so um-hum yeah um like you you mentioned you work for a school system i work for uh Georgia Tech in the research branch and i guess uh oh all right another one that that that i rank up there high is the uh kind of job flexibility and time off um i enjoy as a as a benefit i do too are you talking about like spring break and right right yeah getting a lot of a lot of breaks between quarters and that and having a lot of vacation right it it really um i don't think most of our teachers now i'm not a teacher i am the a secretarial executive assistant but i don't think the teachers could stand the stress all all year long frankly it is just um-hum Texas has really um you know they want everybody educated no matter what it's costs uh and it it would be just we all look forward to like in two weeks we have spring break and i don't know who looks forward to it more the students or the or the teachers and the staff what do you do there um-hum right well um i'm not actually on the teaching faculty but we have a large research organization associated with the university and that's who i work with okay i like um and we're given you know a good bit of flexibility in what we do we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study well that's good yeah i would think that that type of employment you're you're one day you might be really tuned in and the next day oh a little lukewarm or something and and um right you know it's good that they allow you that right it um as i say the schools now we do have to work you know the day but we do get many days off and um we all look forward to it that's only reason i work there is that my children now have graduated and graduated from college but at the time um-hum oh yeah i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh i've just um-hum continued to uh stay there okay are there so are there any things that that you'd like to see changed in terms of the the benefits  well Nancy what kind of a personal computer do you have uh we still have an old uh Texas Instruments Professional Computer back in the days when TI was making uh computers that were similar to in terms of power to the IBM i don't remember what those were the ATs or something like that or something like that yeah i have one of those too way back when i don't know where to get any new software for it unfortunately so we just sort of stumble on using the same stuff that we always have yeah do you use computers at work or um well i used to i have a Master's degree in computer science but i haven't i i took a time out on careers about uh-huh so do i six years ago when my first one turned a year old and i see so nowadays i'm teaching him at home and we're using the computer to drill him on math and to let him do some creative writing without having to have uh uh the mechanics of handwriting get in the way of his words this way he can he this way he just has to hunt and peck on the keyboard i have to admit i'd like a yeah a more logical arrangement of the letters and uh what do they call it the Cortiope or something something like that arrangement oh do you use your computer for other things balancing checkbooks do you keep budgets and that sort of thing in it or um we haven't for we ended up uh actually just sort of keeping it in the closet for a number of years isn't that a terrible statement people who are we're pretty involved with computers in all sorts of other aspects but um i guess i wanted something that was easier to use than this and that was more intuitive and so we just it just ended up not not getting used i should use it to balance my checkbook but then you have to remember to write it down that's right that's right well mine mine kind of died so it's being worked on right now or enter it oh my where do you find a place to work on a TI i found a technician who works at TI uh-huh and does things like that in his spare time well that's nice to know that there are still such people around oh yeah yeah but i most of the stuff i've used that computer for were work related just bringing work home yeah well i used to do that i'd used it um until as i say until i took a hiatus hiatus from working i used to to uh trying to think of what you call it i i used it essentially as a terminal then yeah you know and yeah i've done a lot of that so and i suspect most people do uh use them as terminals or have a spreadsheet and a word processor and that's about it yeah what else do you need right well my kids think i should have games well that's probably true on top of games on top of games and of course we don't have any i keep telling them well you know just learn how to program yeah write your own games right write your own games yeah i just the computer i work have at work came with uh Windows software and it has a couple of games on it one of which is a solitaire just oh just standard card solitaire yeah but the graphics are so incredible and you can choose what you want the deck of cards to look like you know you can have flowers on the back of them or fishes or oh yes or a robot who has a little gauge that moves in his tummy and oh really uh i just i just happened to stumble across that of course i don't play games at work right no who would do something like that but uh yeah we have basically we use the WordStar on it uh-huh you know for a bunch of i'm taking a class now and um i'm actually getting a degree in nursing at this point and i asked the and the class i'm taking now all of a sudden they want everything typed till now everything's been handwritten so it was a good thing that the computer was back up and running hooked the printer up to it that's right i was going to say you must have a printer then right right well i couldn't figure out how to it's been a while since i've gotten it going all right so i tried to hook the printer up and i was sure i put all the uh-huh connectors in right and everything and had checked to make sure the pins were all facing the right way and i couldn't get the computer to recognize that there was a printer there to save my life and so i was like oh this thing doesn't work and we've lost the you know we've lost the install software documentation what am i supposed to do so my husband took it in to work  well we in our country seems to be involved a lot in the Mid East what do you what do you think well yeah i uh and i'm i'm sure there's things going on that that uh we don't know about but but uh it a year a year ago now when the the war Desert Storm was finishing up seems like things were uh going to settle down and nothing seems to of seems to have settled down after all yeah it that that happens a lot doesn't it um-hum wars don't usually settle things much yeah right um um and i i guess i i feel like we we keep getting into places without really understanding what we're doing right uh which really i find upsetting because it seems like we've got experts and we've got people who understand these cultures but i always wonder if they're really used because it seems like then afterwards we have people explaining to us how if they'd only known such and such we wouldn't have done this you know yeah and and i i think there's a and would yeah i i i i have very much doubt that that there's a real understanding at the top levels of of the of the cultures and of what's going on uh-huh in terms of and and it seems to me that our policy basically seems to be uh the enemy of my enemy is my friend yes and that that Saddam Hussein was uh was our buddy buddy as long as he was against Iran uh-huh and uh Iran was our bigger enemy and then when it turns out that uh Saddam Hussein yeah but Iran of course used to be our friend right right i mean we can't it's a little hard to keep it straight isn't it and right oh yes yes and when we decided Saddam Hussein was our enemy then the uh uh oh oh what's his name in uh Syria uh yeah um uh Hafaia Susaad i believe uh is suddenly our friend even though he was he was on our our leading terrorist yeah our leading terrorist list so uh right on hit our really bad list you know and and i i i keep reading about Jordan's King Hussein and i just feel so sorry for him sort of in the middle of all of this trying to keep some sort of sanity living vulnerable right where he is right right right and and uh i think we're trying to we're trying to extricate ourselves somewhat from being so definitely tied to to the Israeli side in terms of all of that Israeli versus Arab right yes yes right right and uh i haven't seen uh solid evidence yet that we're doing a really good job of that yeah yeah so of doing that either no no i i i i just get a sense of our walking in over and over and over again in places where we weren't well versed or something right right didn't didn't know what we were doing so i mean it just feels unprepared or right and something and and if we could it's not wise that i guess i'm still looking for a statesman yes you know someone who really the the the kind of stories you hear about or you look back in history these people really understood what they're doing and did this wise thing every once in a while and i just keep thinking i know there with all the resources we have there must be people who could have explained some of this and said if you do this subtle thing understanding their culture et cetera et cetera it'll have this effect but yeah well it it from what yeah from what little i heard in terms the the the most understanding to get really cynical about it the most understanding uh i uh felt that was displayed in terms of of uh Iraq in particular was that it seemed to me that George Bush was was trying to play the peacemaker in such a way that that he was guaranteeing that given their culture that Saddam Hussein could not back down and would not could not do anything but go to war oh absolutely yes and that uh i mean which which was uh in the line of business that i'm in which is mediation uh oh boy every absolutely everything he did i mean i was in the classrooms teaching children about how to do negotiating and mediating and every single thing we did was against every principle i was teaching it was like um oh that must have been that yes that must have been really fascinating fascinating watching yes it was emotionally quite difficult uh to say the least because it's sort of like yes golly gee this is a set up for absolutely the worst chance possible what are what are we doing here you back someone in the corner is it too surprising if they come out fighting yeah right i mean uh ah didn't you ever see that with children i mean don't right yes yes i i saw did see one of the peace rallies where they just said i can't remember the exact thing it was something like George and Saddam Saddam go home  is all you need huh i think just one is all you need yeah i pushed a an auto dial um so do y'all have a family budget well we don't right now we're planning on setting one up as soon as i can get some you know some better ideas on how to do that have you used one before yeah we um a couple of years ago took a class um that was offered was a guy at our church um called Mastering Your Money by Ron Blue hm oh yeah i've heard of that you've you've heard of him it's really it's been really good we've um we're on a a monthly budget and pretty much we we designed our own um ideas of you know these are some set things that that we know we're gonna spend and um um-hum the rest we have in categories but for the most part it's been somewhat discretionary um the like right now a and the next month will probably be a little higher in clothes if we buy for spring and summer and so we may spend a little more there and a little less in another in another area um-hum so um but it's worked really well we've been able to save um you know what we've wanted to save and and uh pretty much been able to do what we've wanted to do and we have some long term um goals that we want to do have you put money into those categories or what what do you do for that sort of thing well we um i i keep the books and i'm the one that writes all the um all the bills and stuff and pretty much um i just know what i have to spend no you may not um i know what i need to spend or what i have to spend and i just try not to spend it i know some people do um envelope envelope envelope um-hum um-hum systems and stuff but i don't find that works real well for me well do you have any money that you uh specifically set aside for certain savings uh you know savings objectives yes we have um we have like a college fund for our kids and we have um a house fund and we have a car fund and i mean where do you put that money uh we put it in a savings account or we have some of it in CD's and stuff but we we take that out every month and then divide it up into the categories that that we have and we also we have a category of of short term goals that we put aside money each month and if we want to like right now we're getting ready to um-hum put up a fence and that will come out of there it's money that we haven't budgeted for oh yeah it you know things you know things like that and then um um-hum that's where it will come from and if we don't have the money in there we have to wait until it's you know up to where we where it needs to be that's probably the key part right there is waiting until you get the money that you budgeted i i'm sorry i didn't i didn't hear you i say that's probably the key part right there is waiting until the money that you've planned for is there what about credit cards do have you do you still use those or yeah um is that part of the system to discontinue that well he recommends that you don't um or he helps he recommends that you you get them down we we've never been real big credit card users and we always pay it off um um-hum every month if we use them um we're not real big cash carriers so occasionally we will spend or we will you know put uh a meal on it or um i don't know sometimes i'll do mail order stuff and i'll put it on there but it we always it always we will always work it out where where we pay it off at the end of the month so we don't put just a whole lot on there we don't use them just real real often except i do use my gas i keep track of my gas on my credit cards um-hum um-hum because that either you're not financed charged on there and you don't and you don't um you don't need to have cash there and they don't now you can get it at you know cash is the same price as credit right yes so are you married yes we are i am and uh we've got some children and uh you know we've just seen the need for well we just moved into a house uh that we're renting and that's gonna which will suck up your money real quick yeah yeah it really will so we're you know we're going to have to really take a hard look at our uh expenses and things like that and uh you know really make the dollars uh go a little bit further if we can and we uh had not been paying very much for housing uh since we moved to Dallas in July um-hum and uh you know we'd go out to eat on Sunday after church or something like that and i think we're gonna have to kind of watch what we do now because that can add up with five kids  okay Martin do you do any exercise yes i do uh i like to uh play basketball and weight lifting those are probably the two main things i like to do uh-huh um so those are more or less indoor sports how's the weather out there in Georgia yeah um in in in the winter you typically it's it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis um i like to play tennis in the summer time or in the spring fall uh-huh but in the winter it it's gets pretty cold oh um yeah so it's mostly indoor sports i think in the winter uh-huh um how about yourself well yeah i'm on a exercise program i'm riding my Aerodyne bike um half an hour every morning and i'm just about ready to uh-huh up it to forty five minutes a morning and i feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time um-hum it's it's kind of kept me from getting cabin fever and um has seemed to be a real nice aerobic exercise right do you uh do any anaerobic type weight lifting or weight training type exercise no huh-uh i first of all i'd like to get my weight off i'm about fifty pounds overweight and so i'd like to get the weight off and then i'd really like to get into that um-hum and uh we have a my husband and i have a a aerobic video that's called The Firm i don't know if you've heard of it but it's a an aerobic video with not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down but you're using weights and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done it is really it's really fun huh yes it's it's it's aerobics it's similar to aerobics with weights yes uh-huh but it's like low impact aerobics where you use weights uh-huh yes okay are you familiar with um step or bench aerobics um no i mean yes i am but i have never done it myself have you done that uh yes i have in in Atlanta that's um most of the health clubs oh are all that's the that's the in thing that's the big thing huh at first it was just regular aerobics but now bench or step aerobics have kind of taken over oh so how is that um it they call it a low impact aerobics and it's supposed to burn off more calories at the same time ooh and from when i've done it it does give you a good a real good workout but the only thing i'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees oh you know that and movement of going up on the step uh-huh you know that could create a problem yeah they they seem to think that it it won't but you never know huh now if um playing basketball are you knees do you have healthy knees yeah i i think my ankles probably are my lame weak point but oh dear i've i've kind of taken care of that i wear high tops and then also an an a support ankle brace which is very stiff uh-huh and um wearing wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so um-hum that's good well that sounds you sound just like my husband he he he injured his ankle about seven months ago playing volleyball and yeah oh he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy and so that's what he does he wears his yeah i his brace and his high tops and um-hum yeah i did i injured mine so many times that rehabilitating became quite easy oh uh oh shoot i mean it would only take three or four days and i could play again on it wow because after a while you just learn how to to rehabilitate yourself to play that way uh-huh oh dear oh but um so how how successful is your exercise video it is amazing how fast you take off the inches uh-huh and i would once i start my forty i'd like to do the forty five minutes a day on the bike for a week and then every other day i'd like to incorporate the video um and then the bike on the other day um but it is really amazing how fast the inches come off and the muscle builds um-hum real fast um you can start they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells and then build up to your uh twenty five pound dumbbells um-hum and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video and it's a hour long video so it's a good workout so it is yeah i really enjoy that so i'm looking forward to losing this weight and being firm and healthy um-hum so in the winter i guess there's a lot uh it's quite cold and and snow yes yes now this one has been quite mild um we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground it was quite chilly but not  so how do you get most of your current event information well during see i'm going to school right now and uh while i'm working i don't get a i don't get a chance to read the paper a lot uh-huh and i don't watch TV as much really either because uh my free time is kind of and i do like to do other stuff with it while i'm at work sometimes i on the computer network um right um-hum i read the news sometimes and that's kind of helpful i would imagine going to college though your professors and different things you keep up on what's going on that's true i mean my roommates and stuff you know yeah people around me talk about it and the people i work with are pretty you know up up-to-date on that kind of stuff so right well i'm a housewife i have three kids and so um i get most of my information probably through just the news at six o'clock and then um uh-huh yeah talking with people and just hearing what's going on but do you watch do you watch the network like major network news or do you watch like the McNeil Lehrer Hour just the regular channel just channel eight that's our channel here that's the um eyewitness news oh really uh-huh oh channel see channel where i am channel eight's um like public TV so it's kind of different so oh uh-huh yeah i think i think the uh i think a lot of the commentators on like the major networks like right it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on but um it seems that um they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they you know report on the news right and i think even in the elections they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not and basically you know if a candidate candidate can get them to follow then the news will yeah you know kind of publicize his name yeah exactly i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on uh-huh uh because they can they can only report on i mean they give each candidate perhaps you know ten second blurbs in which to you know to say you you just can't get a full picture of you know their message unless you have time to sit down and read and probably read something on it right right and the news too it just doesn't um cover all that many stories i mean it just covers your basic you know violent crimes yeah and you know and and your catastrophes catastrophes with weather and stuff but other than that you really don't know what's going on yeah um i will read our current letters that come out on elections and i guess i do read that and i do study who's running in our area and i do study what's going on in the economy it you know and i guess i do read other magazines um too to get my information what kind of uh see i subscribe to like Science News and that's that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of all like the updates like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would you know bog me down that i wouldn't know about right i but other than that i don't really read i don't i don't really subscribe to anything else i used to read every month a Reader's Digest uh-huh but um now i guess i just have friends that clip articles or if i you know am interested in something of course during the war when we were in war i read up on that just a little in the newspaper to find out what was going on but a lot of the times oh yeah i you know i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper but i just can't seem to find the time if they'd put it out in a video or on not a video but a cassette tape or something where you could just listen to it i would do that while i was doing other things yeah yeah but well i remember during back during the uh during the war everyone here at work always had the radio or the TV on because that they were going constantly with that stuff right but uh well i um they even did a story on our news here in Texas on what people wanted to see more of and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of Texas news you know we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in Dallas yeah that we want to hear what's going on with the economy what's being done to help it what's going on in other countries what's you know just more information if they reported every murder if they reported every violent crime in Atlanta it would take it would probably take the whole news hour but uh yeah well i guess you'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the uh summer Olympics oh yeah that's they still already they're having like um in the newspaper they have a section i think every now and then on on the Olympics you know and they've got like a countdown it's like sixteen hundred days or something i know we're trying to get tickets to it right now yeah oh really that's gonna be crazy that time of year here but uh yeah i can't believe i mean they're they're uh stretching out the Olympic news for that much coverage over i guess people want to hear about it also big in big in the news right now is the Braves because they're uh they're in you know training spring training or whatever and they did so well last year right right yeah they spent a lot of time that's another thing they spend a long time on sports and i think that um that's fine i would like to see more time spent on other things but yeah it seems like i don't know it's they way they do the newscasts uh i wish they they kind of separated it you know or if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some some channel for it but i don't have cable  uh do you have any recycling going on in your community uh yes we do we've started out with uh um all the waste haulers have uh been authorized or commanded i'll put it that way to pick up uh lots of different kinds of waste uh-huh and they uh uh the result has been that they have increased their rates by about three times uh oh and uh so now you have all kinds of of uh things they didn't use to pick up like magazines and uh various forms of of uh glass tin and things like that uh-huh uh so they used to pick this stuff up but just throw it away but well no in a a long time ago you didn't uh they didn't pick up any of that and then uh they started to pick up a few things but lately they've gone in to it in a big way and they've said the uh they have to pick up oh really i think it's uh plastic and glass well plastic and magazines which uh in the past nobody picked up it's my impression that uh it's rare to find someone who will recycle magazines the glossy magazines yes yes uh and then they charge you for the service yes well now these so they're we're being charged because the rates have the trash uh pickup rates have gone up uh like i say almost by a factor of three for some people uh-huh was this something that was voted on or uh uh by the City Council or something the City Council did it they decided that there was uh-huh Portland is kind of a ecology minded area and so they uh uh-huh uh although there're some complaints because the there were volunteer agencies that would do it uh at a minimal charge and a lot of the the articles in the papers or the letters in the papers these days have suggested that the waste haulers now that they have a monopoly uh um uh they'd charge for it they charge whether you take advantage of it or not much more exorbitant rates than the uh than the volunteer you know you pay to have your magazines recycled that kind of thing uh-huh in the past they said well we we were paying far less to have our magazines recycled than we do now uh-huh because the waste hauling uh uh companies have a monopoly now um-hum so they can you know it's the old thing about uh now that i have to do it uh they can they don't have to work very hard at at keeping costs down right so how about your area well we have uh some volunteer run recycling in some towns near here uh in our own neighborhood there's a private company that comes around once a week and uh picks up recyclables they do not pick up magazines uh and i believe they don't pick up the plastic i think it's the two categories you talked about it's just newspapers bottles cans and uh cardboard and it used to be free for a few weeks then they sent out little flyers saying hey we still want to do this for free but we're not quite making ends meet and we'll take donations and i i'm i don't not sure if anybody really sent the donations in to this private company just to be nice and i believe they're going to start charging now uh and i i'm not sure what we're going to do i mean it definitely diminishes the amount of trash we have to put out so it may work out monetarily okay for us to be charged for it uh and since they are private if they charge too much they'll people will just start throwing it in the trash of course around here we we have to pay for our trash pick up right we pay for our trash pickup but this isn't the trash people oh i see what you're saying this is another this is uh um Carl Carl's recycling and uh he comes around with a truck of his own so it's completely uh private and nonmandatory and people just put things out on the curb um he's competing with some uh very small scale people who go around with shopping carts about an hour before his truck comes and try to get the most valuable recyclables so it's uh the thing that that has uh another thing that's been in the press here has been that uh with the volume of recyclables coming in the the prices have dropped so that they can't even pay for the uh um-hum how should i say it the market can't absorb all of the uh yes yes i've heard that that yeah it's uh they have all this used newsprint that people don't want right right and certain kinds of glass uh the green glass has no market it's piling up i don't know where they get green glass i guess they get it from  how do you feel about capital punishment um i'm i'm definitely against it definitely against it yeah for what reasons uh i think that they make a lot the system makes a lot of mistakes and a lot of innocent people are probably convicted of crimes and it's bad enough when um you know when it's not capital punishment but when it's capital punishment when you find out later it's too late um-hum yeah definitely yeah i i i agree that you know capital punishment is bad but just more for the economic for economic reasons because i i don't think it acts as a deterrent and i don't think that um and and and for what i've what i've read it costs a lot more to actually you know go through the process of condemning someone and killing them than it does to actually just feed for the end end you know yeah it dose because because of uh the the legal system that we have now and i'm sure you can make it cheaper if you wanted i don't think you should uh-huh but you can make it cheaper to kill people by not allowing all the appeals and as a matter of fact i think they are starting to cut back on some of them at the Supreme Court uh-huh um i forgot what area it is but regarding uh capital punishment there are some cases that won't automatically get reviewed by the Supreme Court when they used to be uh-huh so what happens is you have to pay all these high powered lawyers to keep on arguing the case over and over again uh while they're waiting for capital punishment which is what happened uh which happens a lot a friend of mine uh does that type of work down in uh um-hum down in Tennessee he's he's an attorney he represents people on death row is he prosecution he's he's he's for the defendant okay yeah yeah and i did criminal defense work for a while so i kind of have a a um let's say um uh-huh cynical about the system and the way people are convicted of crimes not that i think i do believe that most people are charged with crimes and convicted certainly people that are convicted of crimes most of them are probably guilty anyway yeah uh-huh uh-huh i mean i'm not denying that but there are a few that probably aren't yeah it's uh i mean i've you know i've seen people that you know definitely got screwed by the system yeah so before yeah um is do they have the death penalty in New York no huh um they do in Georgia right yeah they yeah they do um yeah i'm not sure how often we how often this actually it seems like about once a year they execute someone i don't really keep you know i only keep up after when the last one was right well that's the thing i mean i happened to have been talking to somebody at at uh work today about that um-hum um-hum just happened to come up in conversation and so i was surprised when i got this topic come up and uh the um-hum the bottom line was that uh what was i saying uh nobody in Tennessee has been convicted has been executed since nineteen executed since nineteen uh seventy uh what seventy three or whenever it was that they ruled that the death penalty was cruel and unconstitutional constitutional yeah and whether it was unconstitutional and then like i said they came back and um like the nineteen eighties and and determined that if they have like a separate trial to determine the death penalty they call them bifricated trials uh-huh um they have a separate trial just to determine whether they're going to give the death penalty or not uh-huh um then then that's okay they can it becomes constitutional i guess it's like a procedural protection that that people have um-hum um but nobody's been nobody's been executed since they've brought that back and in Tennessee yeah in Tennessee so it puts a lot of pressure on them you know one thing that i've always that i've one idea that i've heard that that that i've you know kind of had some sympathy for is though that you know when you have someone that's you know that that that's you know that that you are going to be stuck is going to be stuck with life imprisonment you know or two hundred and fifty years you know none of it served you know at the same time that you know to give them the choice of having the death penalty yeah it seems you know if you lock him away for the rest of his life you know yeah but it's kind of like under under duress anyway but you know kind of saying to someone all right now that we've got you by the chops because you decide whether you're going to die or not but but yeah that's what that guy Gary Gilmore did right uh-huh uh-huh yeah he he told us his yeah he said that he wanted to die at that point that guy right and they you know kind of chose his way to death which is is kind of interesting but um yeah i i personally think people have the right to die if they want so yeah if you're in jail if you're in jail for life then you should be able to commit suicide if that's what you want um-hum it which is basically what that is but you know it really bothers me that in historical cases where you know someone tries to kill themselves in prison you know on death row and you know where they've actually you know spent you know thousands of dollars reviving them you know just to kill them yeah sure and it always so it seemed to be some sort of i did some i did some environmental environmental law as well and and one of the i remember in studying something about the F D A they was it what the hell were they trying to do they were trying to get a a a drug it was a drug that they were using for the death penalty and they right they tried to get it proved safe before the F D A would approve it um-hum oh like in Texas  i think that uh one uh advantage of having uh the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't uh convict someone who uh really shouldn't be convicted um definitely and i think that you know a unanimous verdict uh helps to ensure that i guess uh maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way that uh you uh would have a problem uh you know that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted um-hum have you ever served on a jury before uh i have twice it was pretty wild experience oh uh what sorts of cases were they they were just you know small town cases where uh trailers and banks were involved you know so were they criminal or civil they were civil they weren't they weren't any criminal oh okay what uh what was the verdict did the did the jury have trouble reaching a decision uh the jury it was uh let me see i think it was ten to one on the jury because they only had to have eleven people yeah so it was they and uh the one changed his vote at the end so did it become so it became unanimous you know after they turned it in and then he changed his mind after they turned it in but it then became unanimous so yeah ah oh but since it was a civil case it really didn't matter right you just needed a majority right what was what was the other case that was also civil the the uh other case was just traffic the and you know it was seat belt law and it it didn't even hardly yeah oh didn't really even count go through so yeah i'm i'm a college student so i haven't been you know of a jury eligible age for very long um yeah and uh i did get um one summons actually at one point but i declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student because it was uh a very bad time yeah well you learn a lot going to the juries like that though yeah i mean i i really i would like to uh to do it at some point um but uh i i haven't um one one thing that i i think is um you know maybe is a problem is uh i i i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well it uh especially sort of i wouldn't think that it does ow well i mean from from my experience from what i experienced in them it didn't you know it didn't the didn't turn out the as the way i planned it i mean the way that i would think that it would go it ah but you thought it turned out pretty well yeah but it was you know it was jury was unorganized and it was it was just wasn't organized enough for me so yeah i'm not used to it not being organized and i just assumed assumed that it would have been oh so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of someone had to figure out what was going on that's that's about what it was hum that's interesting did it did it work out pretty well in the end i mean did a couple of people sort of gradually sort of assume uh sort of a moderator role in the trial or yeah they well they picked the one person and then he finally you know moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have so so it worked it did end up working out pretty well yeah it ended up working all right the one thing i sometimes wonder about um in civil cases is uh whether especially sort of in uh maybe like product product liability or medical malpractice where there's um sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes yes you know it's not just a matter of um of you know did this guy rip off this guy and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract it's sort of a matter of uh you know sometimes getting into very technical issues and i wonder if uh if there's really um if the system works adequately in in educating the jurors about uh whatever um you know issue is under discussion uh i don't think that they they they educate them enough to to really know what's going on in in the case you were involved in you said it was just sort of a a bank matter of some kind so yeah the bank was suing them for uh because they went to get the the trailer yeah that which was assumingly their property it was on his property ah oh so the deal was that he had uh borrowed money from the bank to buy it and he hadn't made the payments right so they came to get it yeah and then when they came to get it well it it was on the landlord's property and he wouldn't let them take it off ah so they were suing to get it back so and they'd already it was a double wide so they'd already taken it apart ah so they left it there yeah and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it uh so they were suing him for the money and you know there's no way they could because it's it was the moving company  uh Greg uh i'm i'm not familiar i think uh you guys in Indiana don't you have the the death penalty yeah we do have the death penalty here it's not exercised very often but we do have it uh-huh i believe it i can't even remember the last execution we had here actually uh-huh uh personally i'm in favor of capital punishment i know there's a lot of lot of problems with it but uh um-hum seems to me that some crimes are just so heinous that that the person just uh i feel doesn't deserve to live doesn't deserve for the tax payers to spend however many thousands of dollars it costs a year to keep them in in prison for life right uh i know there's a lot of problems with that like well they say okay if you declare someone put them on death row and execute them well then ten late years later you find out that he really didn't do it then that life was wasted but um-hum just seems like in some cases that it's a it's a good policy um-hum uh i i tend to agree with you uh i've changed my views over uh even even within the last few years uh to be honest uh uh when i was in college when i was an undergraduate i was a member of Amnesty International uh-huh and uh of course at that time you know i thought uh how it's it was stupid to kill anybody for uh you know that the eye for an eye was a stupid argument right but the uh the more now i live in downtown Dallas and i uh you know i've seen uh i've seen cases on in the news and all where where you know uh a a right person who had murdered a person is back on the street and then commits another murder right i think that maybe a a good solution to capital punishment might be uh reserve it solely for uh repeat offenders of a crime like uh murder that's a that's a thought that i had never really had on that which which seems pretty sensible yeah uh i yeah it seems sensible and and fail-safe i uh i i don't you know not completely fail-safe but if a man's convicted of two murders uh you know there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong right uh i also uh to tell you how liberal i have turned uh toward this or or or whatever side that is i've kind of chosen uh i believe that that uh right yeah big time drug importers like uh say Noriega for example these these people need to be uh eliminated uh uh-huh uh-huh from society and i think i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people because uh really any kind of uh uh jail sentence for them is just another chance to uh create another power structure yeah you're you're right there uh you know the i just basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just uh-huh you you know they come out with these figures that it costs fifty thousand dollars taxpayer dollars a year to keep someone alive in jail when they're going to be there for life they're never going to be rehabilitated right right i mean i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with so to me i'm paying taxes you know twenty percent of my check or whatever right um-hum to keep somebody alive who i in my mind shouldn't be there in the first place and is never going to be a valuable or worthwhile part of society so i i'm all in favor of it um-hum uh do you uh are there cases where you think that that uh the capital capital punishment shouldn't be uh uh sentenced well i i really don't know on that question it just seems like for instance the Jeffrey Dahlmer case i mean i i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets um-hum and in that case Wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment right and i think that that he should not be allowed to live but you know then you're kind of playing God which is never never a good thing to do but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld that's true yeah right uh not really that i can think of i i would i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like you know murders and like you said repeat murders or serial killers uh-huh uh-huh uh i don't really agree with the uh death penalty for people like Noriega and such as that i think that they're they're operating on a more i mean i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here but i don't really think that that it's it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live because they're feeding our consumer needs right sure yeah i understand i understand your point yeah uh of course you know with uh with with Dahlmer now uh you you realize that Ohio i think it's Ohio uh gets to try him next and they do have the death penalty um-hum yeah yeah so uh that was a curious case i yeah yeah that is very curious uh uh that was something is sort of nightmarish to say the least yeah that's that's right uh well here in Texas we uh i think even even this last week uh last week they had another they uh you know they use their capital punishment by lethal injection uh uh  okay i guess it took so i guess recording has started now yeah uh so have you ever served on a jury i served i was in the Air Force and served on a court martial uh board a couple of times which is very similar to a jury a lot of the same rules apply have you ever served on one yeah i finally served on one last year i've um been voting for years and i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called yet uh-huh and i finally was so it was an interesting experience i was kind of boring was it civil or criminal uh it was uh a grand jury or something uh it was uh well let's see it was municipal court so it was a combination of uh and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks uh-huh i see so it was a combination of criminal and civil and they had uh well most of the time we we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors and then uh-huh it was always we was exciting when we got called to to to go because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides uh just sit in the jury room uh-huh uh did did the judge uh hand down sentences or did you folks do that uh yeah the judge did uh i uh i had a hard time getting seated on a jury i kept getting uh i'd be questioned uh for impaneling the jury and they kept uh dismissing me uh-huh um course they don't have to give a reason but it's just whether the prosecutor or the defense attorney feels like you know they want to get the best uh mix for their case so they ask all kinds of wild questions no that that's a science in itself yeah well i kept getting called up for drunk driving uh questions and i think part of it was they didn't uh they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more uh-huh i see because you'd probably be uh too puritanical and to yeah that was probably it although in my case i might have been more uh sympathetic with the person who got caught i don't know uh-huh so uh were were the uh sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair or would if you were deciding do you think that they would have been different well i was never there never there for any sentencing uh i finally got impaneled on one case uh on my next to the last day and uh we got into the uh jury room to uh decide the case and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate because he'd already decided that the guy was uh not guilty and he would never vote for guilty huh so uh they appointed me jury jury foreman and i uh didn't think that uh going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict so i told the judge that we weren't were unable unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate so the whole thing had to be tried over again um wow i bet that made him happy yeah yeah it was uh it was funny the uh i just i i don't know i uh i didn't uh uh i didn't like not being able to deliberate i uh i i wanted to vote guilty for the guy and the other people were kind of mixed right uh-huh so uh the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again cost him a lot of money i'm sure yeah oh how many members were on the jury was it a six or twelve member jury uh it must have been six uh-huh that's kind of curious to me i didn't realize until the uh Wayne Kennedy Smith trial uh yeah a few months ago that they had six member juries i thought that they you know it was always twelve twelve men tried and true so to speak um but uh apparently for some some crimes it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment um i know on a getting to this unanimous thing whether you know a jury should be unanimous or not or not in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous it's simple a simple majority you know rules yeah well let's see is it on uh capital crimes that they have to be unanimous and a probably on capital i don't know we weren't we the two that i were on had to do with drugs uh-huh and uh we were uh unanimous in acquitting the person even though we in our in our uh gut felt that the individuals were both guilty just because of the friends because of various things the government really failed to prove its case and you know being fair to the person if the government doesn't prove its case no matter how you feel you have to go by what's offered as proof and we had to acquit him in both cases uh too it was too circumstantial uh yeah it was yeah in some of the critical things like the off special investigations at one time in one of the cases had videotaped this person but something happened to the camera and the tape and um all they could do was testify about  course i don't like talking about budgets no not my favorite subject oh you don't this is my first one we just bought a house about three months ago and so we had to go on one and um what i do is um just divide up my paycheck and put it in each category i put it in my day planner and i have a certain amount on each column like under groceries or electricity um-hum and i put so much in each one and then just subtract of just spend what the amount in each column what we're allotted uh-huh so you pretty much keep pretty close to your budget yeah if not we're up a creek yeah boy well we bought a house about a year and a half ago but i i can't say that i'm as uh good as as you are about our budget because i mean i'm in charge of paying the bills but uh you know i put a little bit in the savings first and then after that i'll you know pay on everything as i can and uh-huh and that's i i don't have a budget other than that i know i need to and i know we probably will in the future but as of yet we're just still trying to you know get on on where we wanna be financially and then uh-huh maybe we can um you know work more on you know they have all these financial plans and how much money you have saved and where you wanna put it and everything well we're still we're still trying to save a little bit yeah that's tough we have an emergency fund that we keep and that was tough to get we try to not touch that we've gone to the house but sometimes you dip into it yeah well yeah exactly yeah exactly and see we've got two used cars and you know when you have used cars there's always something you're fixing on them oh yeah you may not have a car payment but you know you have those regular maintenance things i mean like uh-huh do both of you work your husband yeah yeah but i'm gonna be out of a job in September oh you are yeah where do you work at oh i work for a liquor uh distiller liquor distiller yeah and they're moving their offices up offices up to Connecticut oh wow so i'll be staying down here but i'm not real worried about it so but it's something else that you know we have to be considering in our budget um-hum and trying to take care of everything you know all the um outstanding debt that we have and kind of getting ready for it yeah yeah that's a thing we try to stay out of is debt um it it's the worst thing because when i got out of college you know that was our mistake when we got married you know we didn't have much so we kind of charged it up and now we're you know paying for it it it's hard though when you first get married you want things to live on because i just got married what two and a half years ago um-hum and we tried not to do that my wife worked at the time so we bought most no but she's not working now do y'all have a family um no it's just me and her right now oh well we don't have a family either besides a couple dogs and a cat we have one dog but it's good well she's looking for part-time work just to try off to pay off her car yeah well i wanna try to um go back to school get a degree that that you know i something i'll enjoy doing a little bit more oh uh-huh so you know um i'll what's your husband do i'm sorry my husband he works in banking he's in finances and economics he's kind of like a loan servicer accountant right now but he's trying to trying to switch over into international trade because you know with the free trade agreements going on here there's really gonna be a lot of opportunity uh-huh that's true so we hope anyways and what do you do um i work for Morton International and make um i'm a process engineer that we make automotive safety bags oh automotive safety bags is that like air bags the air bags yeah same thing another term well i guess i covered all the budgeting that i wanted to i don't do you have to go up until do you have to go until the voice comes on but i'm not sure do that no you don't you you can stop at anytime you're you're finished i mean i've never i've been doing this for a while now and i've they've never not paid me so oh okay oh good all right well thanks for talking Wendy yeah it was nice talking to you you too bye bye-bye  uh hello Steve hello uh you were going to talk about child care yeah uh we well me and my wife we got a five year old and we have um-hum uh kind of like child rearing he we have problems with him every now and then but other than that it's it's pretty he's a pretty good kid um-hum um-hum and we uh really don't really have any problem with finding day care for him because i'm in the service and we just take him to the day care on base i see how much how much do they charge they charge about forty five dollars a week uh-huh that seems relatively low by commercial standards isn't it usually about sixty to a hundred a week um yeah it's it's pretty pretty expensive on the outside right um so you've you've been you've been pleased with the service oh yeah they do a lot of you know lot of stuff in in their day care and stuff uh-huh uh how long have you been taking your son there oh about a year now uh-huh before that did he go somewhere else or well before that my wife was kind of stay at home mom now she went back to school so i see you say you went back to school no the wife went back to school oh i see uh-huh so he's been there for almost a year now uh-huh um gee i think where where does she go to school she goes to UT uh Arlington uh-huh okay yeah i had a student who went there at one time but i think we're getting off the topic so yeah uh so um let's see i mean i i was uh reading i read a lot of articles on child care back when it was when there was a debate in Congress over funding of uh child care centers and what should be done yeah and i came out uh very much in favor of a tax credit approach where parents would be given a tax credit and they would select whatever services they wanted for their child rather than to have the government subsidize certain providers yeah and uh that was i i thought it was important well i mean it is important uh that that people have the opportunity to select the service that they would choose because a lot of kids are in you know in centers well well not really centers but they're being cared for by neighbors and uh um-hum uh that's the sort of they they prefer it that way the parents do because they know the people who are caring for their kids and they don't have to take them very far plus about a third of the kids are in church run centers and there was a big church state controversy over whether the government could fund those are not i think they ultimately decided to but they placed a lot of restrictions on it so it wasn't clear that the church child care centers would want to go to the trouble um yeah so uh anyway i continue to be an advocate of the um of the tax credit approach now myself i'm not married so i don't have any kids and it's not a problem but uh still i know a lot of people that do and uh you know i mean you you you really wouldn't wouldn't um uh well i'm on gee i'm on the benefits committee at the university here and uh child care is a topic of conversation we the university started up a center this year but it's about two miles away from campus and i'm not sure it's going to be real convenient for people to take their kids over there yeah well well when i was stationed in Lubbock Texas uh they had a child care center right on base uh right at the school i mean uh-huh uh-huh and that helped out my wife because she just went part time there and you know take a couple of classes a week but uh-huh right uh-huh and uh i think it's a good deal deal but um like you were saying it's about two miles from the school and that's yeah it's just a lot of time it's not going to be very good i think they should talk about putting one right on the campus itself yeah well they say they claim that it's a better environment for kids than to be in with all the students well they kind of have this i think in a different building you know on right on the uh edge of the campus and everything where they really didn't get in uh-huh yeah yeah i am sure that a lot of it had to do with how cheap it was to acquire the building if they would've built a new building then it would've i'm i'm sure it would have cost a lot more than if they uh if they put it down where they did where real estate's probably cheaper in oh yeah um i think they used one of the existing buildings they already had um-hum so you know it it worked out pretty good so so so what do you think about the about the child about the tax credit versus the subsidy approach which seems seems most appealing to you uh well i haven't really thought about it like that because well you know we pay yeah i think well the excuse me we pay for any you know the child care but we don't pay as much as they do off base that's right yeah uh i think the government should subsidize some of it you know to give the parents you know some break on on the money portion of it well i mean they they yeah the issue the issue is whether they can take it off of their taxes or whether the government decides which centers are qualified the other problem  i haven't had to put anyone in a nursing home but we came close have you had that experience yet no i haven't either but a lot of my friends and actually my boss had to put his mother in a nursing home and i know just going through it with him i mean it's a real traumatic experience um-hum that's for sure yeah first just even deciding to do it and then i think feeling guilty after you know that it needs to be done you know um-hum um-hum uh yeah i had a a good friend who just did it and and my boss too oh really yeah and uh and uh well both his parents were sick not doing well went to take care of one and then one of them died and then it was um-hum what do you do with the other person it's particularly hard if they live away okay that's what i was just going to say if they're out of state you know it's different if they're in the same town i think you have a little more chance to look out for them but um-hum yeah then too if you work you know you get there has to be somebody there well that's a problem and i uh my grandmother was ninety two ninety three when she died and she was able to stay in her apartment but the but the cost of that was unbelievable to have the nurses now i don't know that it would have been any better in a nursing home but at that point um-hum it was you know uh she was old enough that it was like that's where she she wanted to die was where she was not to uh-huh oh oh you mean not staying at home you mean and not yeah yeah staying at home yeah not going somewhere else i think it's harder if they if they're younger but need a lot of care um-hum you know at ninety that's one thing at at sixty or seventy it's something else and yet no yeah well that's just it because i mean jeez they've got probably probably good twenty years to live you know some some cases if they're healthy you know right right right exactly and if the and and yet if the care is just is just so hard then that's you know that's really hard and i don't know what you know what the different things that you would look for i mean obviously uh you want it to be clean you know it would be clean yeah clean and that that it's got a good reputation as far as health et cetera but then atmosphere seems like would make so much difference i know and to make sure that there's enough people there to keep everybody like that can you know to be involved instead of just leaving them sit in their rooms you know yes that that's the picture you always see of people just sitting in the halls um-hum yeah oh in fact i used to date a guy that reminds me when i was back in Minneapolis but his mother i mean he had she ended up i guess getting it Alzheimer's what they now call Alzheimer's yeah Alzheimer yeah but to begin with you know when they first i mean she would know us you know and we'd go to visit her but then it would get you know like she didn't really know she didn't know me and then she thought he was a brother you know and it just got steadily worse you know uh-huh yeah well i that's the thing i mean when it's something like that i i think it particularly if it's something like that and they really don't know where they are um-hum it doesn't feel i would think that would be easier than someone who really does know and is saying i don't and has been independent all their lives and then all of a sudden you know exactly and i you know i don't i don't want to go kind of thing but the other side of it is that my grandmother moved out of her home and into an apartment of elderly people but it is was not a nursing home and that's where she died but she lived there for ten or twelve years um um-hum um and she did she really went through uh like a depression for about a year moving out of her home but then she said just getting used to it oh well she says course this is so wonderful because all i have to do is open my door you know go out the hall and down stairs to the place to eat or down stairs to the lobby and there're people there uh-huh oh uh-huh which in her home you know there weren't i mean the logistics of it become so difficult that she said i've i've really made some friends and that feels good so that's the other side of it is well that yeah would definitely be a positive part because they'd be around more people and would be easier for them to get out and to see those people i guess um-hum um-hum yeah but but it's just that you know how do you i guess unless you visit a lot and unexpectedly and assuming that you can visit unexpectedly well i would think that you ought to be in fact i was going to say that i would go at different times of the day not only when they're expecting you to come uh-huh you know just to see how you know at different times of the day what they do and how they treat them you know exactly and how everything looks and and then and then the other thing is really listen to what they say because and that's another hard thing uh you know if the as people get older we we all seem to uh fuss just a little bit more about everything so then the question is is the fussing legitimate or not um-hum or is it just because yeah they're having such a hard time adjusting you know uh-huh so they'll tell you well she says she doesn't like the food but you should see her plate you know or some um-hum so then you i guess you'd have to be there to be sure that that's  topic is recycling today and actually i'm pretty hot about the topic right now yes i am oh you are you're you're into uh recycling i'm into recycling i've got several friends who use me as their recycling drop off matter of fact um-hum what materials do you recycle i recycle glass plastic and aluminum also paper and plastic bags um-hum and i uh in Dallas we recently had a report on the news in the evening about what's being done with the recycled the recycling materials um-hum and green glass and several other items but green glass in particular is being tossed into the landfills and i got really hot about that because my husband my husband drinks a lot of ginger ale and it's packed in green glass so so you're trying to take action to have that changed well yeah i'm i'm racking my brain thinking okay where can i what can i do to take action on this the only recycling plant i think in the south is in Atlanta um-hum and they're paying i think eighteen cents for every hundred pounds of green glass right so economically it's not a situation where you're going be able to attract a lot of attention no i'm not but i've got right good gosh i've got probably twenty or thirty pounds of it in my yard right now um-hum waiting for a recycling place to take it to and i would really be disturbed if i found out that the place i took it to was going to just put it in the landfill i mean i could have done that well i think um that is kind of becoming one of the drivers now the fact that with all the recycling that took place the price per pound has declined i know aluminum in our area one year ago aluminum was yeah forty five cents a pound and now it's twenty last time i went it was twenty two cents a pound um-hum so it uh there's not a lot of money to be made but it's just a question of trying to help the environment no well that's the that's the thing is i uh i would rather help my environment and uh when i turn in glass and aluminum i turn it in to my church which has a community center um-hum and the community center uses the money to help with an after school program to help keep kids off the streets and to to give them a fighting chance in the world in regards to education and i think that's a real worthwhile project and right that's really what got me started recycling was this uh community center hm yeah where where i work we recycle paper that's about it so do you which kind of paper computer paper yeah any any um noncolored noncolored or nonfilm type paper just white paper and that sort of thing oh any uh-huh oh uh-huh but do they recycle computer paper and i mean like the the green and white barred uh oh we don't use that kind of paper any more no we have perforated oh you don't use that paper okay for personal printers and then like LaserJet type paper oh yeah uh-huh we don't use the green bar type paper any more the old the old green bars um-hum right yeah because our our church also recycles computer paper and i don't know why i was thinking it was just the old green bar style as opposed to um-hum even the personal uh letter sized well i would guess that your church is probably at a point where they're not really breaking even on their recycling i mean uh well unless they get volunteers who have people who have trucks and that sort of thing yeah we have volunteers and there's not that it's not that wide of a participation participation just yet um-hum so although with my friends helping we we contribute quite a bit of glass we all have children and quite a few of the children are in baby food um-hum and those baby food jars believe it or not really add up fast right well there are neighborhoods in the Atlanta area where uh you have specific trash bins to put recyclables in and then they're collected on a regular basis so oh yeah curbside recycling right yeah they have that in Houston and in Dallas and i saw another report where in Houston they take the bins and they load them up into the truck in the separate areas in the truck right and the truck goes and dumps all of it into one landfill that got me heated up too that got me real heated up a friend of my mother's told her about that and she was telling me about it and then i saw a report on TV too and i thought why are we going through this trouble and i had a report tell me why we are we go through the trouble because everybody's worried about the environment and now that we have uh the the smaller the lay people worried about the environment now we have to get the businesses worried about using the recycled product that not that many businesses are right  well what kind of music do you like to listen to i'm pretty diverse actually um i consider myself both a performer and also an enjoyer so i kind of get into all all types i run the gamut from uh are you alternative to uh to rock and roll to heavy metal to you name it so i'm pretty open on that oh you like country western country's not bad i can i grew up in Nebraska so it was like um yeah i i listen to it once in a while but it's it's probably not my my top mode i guess that's pretty pretty popular down in Plano though uh yeah um yeah we've i mean it you know there's you have all sorts here too um i went to a pretty uh well the school i went to was Texas A&M an and uh either you either you went country western dancing or uh oh yeah so you didn't do anything at all right yeah pretty much pretty much so so i have i really liked i liked it there but i also also like some of the Christian um contemporary music that they have play huh uh-huh are you into the Garth Brooks thing at all or is that popular down there right now i know that he's kind of a big name right now yeah yeah yeah it's popular here and uh there's all yeah and you're also into the Christian contemporary stuff yeah yeah i had a i had a roommate that was really into that he was into all the um groups like uh i'm trying to remember DMZ um-hum Resurrection Band uh what else there are a couple of other ones he was into he was into Petra as well yeah in fact it's interesting he he's actually an engineer i don't i i'm going to school in Florida and he's an engineer that does sound mixing mixing right now for a Christian bands oh really so yeah he's pretty into it that's fun it's been it's been lucratim for him well what you you mentioned alternative music well yeah um kind of like what is that i don't know in the early seventies i think it was called punk rock oh okay but then now it's it's kind of taken a different slant and i think it's it's gone more diverse toward um not so much the head banging on the wall stuff as much as just runs really a wider more eclectic uh tone flow and things like that so it's i don't know i like i said i consider myself fairly diverse so um um-hum you said you're also a performer yeah yeah i well i play the trumpet um and also keyboards i played keyboards for about uh oh i don't know twelve thirteen years and played trumpet for about ten so what do you perform do you oh wow it it's good for a side diversion and a little bit of side income you know whenever i can do you do you play anything at all yeah um not on a consistent basis at this point i've got three kids and they're preschoolers so i do good to get a book book read or newspaper read or anything so yeah oh wow sure sure free time is not much of a luxury uh yeah yeah i know that feeling in fact i do good to listen to anything but kids' tapes at this point because i know all the kids' tapes it's like yeah yeah yeah well maybe hey that may be more quality you know after all they do have they do have some good tapes out there for kids we i don't know um yeah Joe Scruggs is a guy that is out of Austin here that has some wonderful kids tapes it's really i mean they are really fun and uh Joe Scruggs he's with he's an educational Joe Scruggs huh um it's called Shadow Play and if you ever see any of his stuff he is just he's really good and and um kids really like it interesting uh when you said Scruggs i was thinking because Earl Scruggs is a real famous banjo player a real famous blue grass player yeah and uh in fact if you remember the the theme from the Beverly Hillbillies uh-huh he actually played part of that oh uh he and Lester Flats so uh i was thinking wow wonder if this is a relative i don't know i don't know well um have you um they're not they're more uh oh have you ever heard of Riders In The Sky i don't know if they're but anyway if they're big up there in fact i think they may have even had a television show on Saturday mornings for kids oh yeah i haven't heard much about that no um they're pretty neat they're kind of a a a blue grass country uh they're real fun i mean they're yeah they're the guys that i mean they can yodel and they can they play the fiddles and the and the saws and stuff and they're real fun they're a real fun group all right yeah kids probably get into that quite a bit yeah i'm uh i'm not quite at that point in my life yet so yeah well yeah it'll probably be a while before i uh before i get into the kids' music in at all so well we saw them originally at a at a club down here um probably about oh seven or eight years ago and um yeah then just in the last i don't know two years we saw them on a TV show and i think they were i think they were doing kids' music but um-hum what we saw in the you know was adult in the but i don't know i don't know where they run the gamut and i don't know um right you know i don't know if the south is more towards the you know has more of that crowd or not i don't know i don't know do you um-hum well it's yeah it's hard to tell i know you know like in the Appalachian Mountain area there that thing's real popular yeah i i've had some friends from West Virginia that's you know that it's real popular around there uh-huh well and  i guess my basic feeling is that as a middle income tax payer i'm not paying too much if i'm sure that i'm getting value for the dollar i mean that i guess sounds like a cliche but uh looking around at a a lot of the infrastructure particularly in the northeast here uh you know bridges and roads in terrible shape and i don't know i'm sort of overwhelmed by it all do you think that that's because the uh because the politicians have been seduced by the opportunity to get the vote uh so they've spent the money on on uh popular how should i say it programs that show up immediately you know like giving away uh uh let's see how shall i say it paying money to people that that uh uh it it takes years for a bridge to begin to show neglect uh whereas a temporary uh uh input of money can uh which they can never turn off by the way will get this guy votes yeah it's entirely possible certainly anything that's been discussed over the the last dozen years or so or maybe even longer in terms of of tax reform or or revenue reallocation seems to be concerned with just that you know who's who's gonna start getting more and how fast um i kind of came of age in the sixties and it seemed to me seems to me that the the general attitude in the entire country is a lot different then than now i mean i think there was more a a general sense of prosperity there was yeah although my oh excuse me i was just going to say there's significantly more money and we weren't a debtor nation in those days yeah i i've never been able to reconcile that fact which which does seem to be true with the fact that the typical middle class family today seems to have you know and expect some what more in terms of material possessions and vacations and what not but back then uh i think there is more of a sense of because there was a feeling of prosperity people did not mind paying for social programs for instance or public improvements and today there there seems to be a sort of a jealous guarding by each generation well i think two things have happened number one uh it's like uh pay play now pay later uh somebody's we're we're to the point now where where the pay later is uh is here and and uh when i was growing up they always warned me against borrowing money to go on a vacation because you have all year long to think about those payments and it just goes by pretty fast well the play now pay later uh mentality uh sounded pretty good at the time when you when you had a fair amount of disposable income and uh um-hum um the the debt load is way up uh you know in the sixties what was the cost of tuition the cost of tuition in those days was was the cost of uh almost monthly rent today right i don't yeah pretty much i mean i i paid whatever something on the order of four thousand dollars a year for tuition and room and board and comprehensive fee and uh for those those figures have been dwarfed today certainly yeah i mean well i'm not saying monthly rent is four thousand dollars but but tuition uh i bet tuition was about a third of that uh yeah you know perhaps anyway what i'm saying is that everything costs more these days uh and we've reached a point where where people are like i say taxes are going up uh your expenses have gone up and the perhaps the thing that's more important uh uh progressive we are now making what uh what we used to think of as only the rich made you know the daily the minimum wage is let's see what is it when i was a i'm i graduated from college in sixty one and i can remember when i graduated i hoped someday to make eighteen thousand dollars a year and taxes on eighteen thousand a year uh were a whole lot less than uh you know taxes on what what i thought was a very good salary yeah um are about the same as they are today only i'm making  so um what do they do about recycling in Raleigh is there any public program yeah they they uh get uh they regarding recycling they just gave us uh about five man about five or six months ago they passed out these um green containers to everybody in the city um-hum and uh they started out by just recycling newsprint and clear glass i think and or well clear glass and uh you know brownish glass and ah however no plastics oh cans was another thing that they're recycling um hm and so you know there really wasn't a lot that i could put in there anyway i just mostly had bottles um um-hum and it seemed like that uh plastic would would would've been very helpful to recycle well finally they started plastics but only the kind of milk bottle plastics yeah um-hum oh that how about how about in your area well in Atlanta they um where i used to live they had a they had just started a program but apparently it wasn't city wide because i moved over to a different neighborhood and they didn't even you know no one had ever heard of this right and um the one nice thing though is i'm is i'm lucky is i'm pretty close to downtown so um aluminum cans be recycled just by tossing them out in your yard and the bums come around and um-hum do they have a deposit on them um no they don't have any deposit but um you know there's a there's a thriving industry of homeless people that collect uh aluminum cans and turn them in for you know recycling the the weight in aluminum right right yeah because uh in in places where there's a bottle deposit i know that if you discard anything somebody will pick it up which is a good argument in favor of deposits uh uh-huh um-hum course uh now it's Adopt-A-Highway they get rid of a lot of that anyway but i'm not sure when they do pick it up if they recycle it there uh yeah um-hum yeah i'm not sure i i don't i think they only carry one bag when i when i've seen people out there you know yeah well i mean well yeah yeah but i mean if you put you know i oh i see what you mean everything would be in the same bag and they would have to separate the cans from all the rest of the trash yeah yeah hm yeah that would that would be good because uh you know um-hum yeah yeah that seems like it would be you know very labor intensive to actually you know go through it all and pick out the different things um-hum right of of course if there's a deposit it's worth it for kids to do um-hum um now soft drink companies don't want that because it uh obviously it would have a negative effect on sales to some degree i don't know yeah i i mean it's you know they have the cost of the cleaning equipment to clean the bottles and um hm i suppose yeah but that would be cheaper than getting new plastic i i think it's just the fact it raises the price temporarily that they don't like and things like that um-hum it should be anyway well did you see there was an interesting article about recycling in the Wall Street Journal about three or four weeks ago um-hum it talked about some commodities that are being recycled uh they they they these critics start recycling before there's an industry to deal with the stuff and um-hum i forget where it was i think it was Portland Oregon ended up burning a bunch of it it was just piling up and they had no where to put it yeah i've heard that you know a lot a lot of the you know more popular recycled materials like aluminum and um paper especially that because you know everyone's become much more environmentally conscious and you know has moved to recycle that hm their you know the the the the the systems basically has this very large backlog of of material to be recycled and and processed and apparently in a lot you know in a lot of industries um-hum you can't just you know take a bunch of stuff and recycle it you generally you mix it with with new material right yeah i think that and that and that you know with you know coupled with the recession that there just isn't you know the demand for you know recycled product yeah well i don't yeah i don't know i guess if as far as packaging materials are concerned are concerned if uh durable goods purchases go down you need less packaging i um-hum um-hum i don't know how much sensitive things like soft drinks sales are to economic conditions though i i i i i expect it well i would expect they ought to be more sensitive than they are or something i think that's one of the things people think of cutting back on but it certainly would be a way to save money um um-hum but um yeah in the the the article uh mentioned that it very much depend upon depended upon what kind of products you're talking about certain things and i believe clear glass is one there is plenty of market for they can use all they can get but it's other things um and i think some of the plastics are are are are among those that's rather difficult to recycle it's just to recycle them there needs to be a greater economies of scale before they become uh viable um-hum yeah yeah i think it depends on like the little number in the circle um-hum that they have on them but because they i have a lot of friends that you know are very into recycling you know and say you know just about you know they they try and throw out as little as they can you know and and hm um-hum yeah that's right right right um well i'm down i read somebody say he was down to uh one bag of garbage a week and that's about the same with me but i'll tell you my garbage is mostly by weight is mostly junk mail um-hum um-hum if i could get rid of that it wouldn't be much at all it's just that um-hum  so have you had to think about uh nursing homes and the elderly that sort of thing in your own life nah not really my parents are still pretty young my father's forty five mother about the same age uh-huh oh that's very young yeah um so that really hasn't been an issue for me uh-huh how about yourself uh no my parents are getting older my father is uh um-hum seventy and my mother must be about sixty five um-hum so i'm starting to think about it but i haven't had to do anything about it yet uh my grand right have they got any kind of uh supplemental insurance for that or no i'm pretty sure they don't um they have some income from pensions and social security um um-hum but no i don't think they have any insurance that would cover that sort of thing yeah well i've heard about most of that insurance i was wondering because it seems like what i've heard is usually that the stuff says uh kind of thing where they cancel you a couple of years after you get in into the home so it tends to be kind of useless anyway yeah its my impression those costs are so high that without something um-hum you know special you can't handle it anyway uh right yeah i mean i think we might uh we talk about having them move in with us um-hum but there are certain health you know certain health conditions that we wouldn't be able to handle and i think we've just sort of avoided thinking about it real hard yeah right yeah i don't know it seems to me that for the kind of money a nursing home typically costs you can maybe even afford to to have a nurse come into the home periodically that might be a good alternative i mean it is my impressions tens of thousands of dollars yeah dollars a year at that point yeah it seems like you could hire somebody part time yeah yeah what the heck yeah yeah and certainly more dignified than uh yeah its than warehousing them it it it does seem like there are a lot of horror stories out there and right uh yeah yeah it's it's kind of scary because it seems like uh you know a lot of people you know it's it's uh the budgets of these places has gotten so tight yeah and uh you know they just really can't take care of them very well the budget and staffing especially if it's a state run i saw something on Sixty Sixty Minutes a few months ago about nursing homes in Texas that was a real you know horror piece um-hum yeah it seems like every time i see something on television it's not good yeah so and i guess you know we have to think about gee maybe we have another forty years before we'd end up in that sort of situation is it possible we could yeah yeah put away enough money to handle it ourselves yeah it seems that way huh um do you do you have grandparents who are left yeah i sure do they're they're pretty healthy everybody in my family seems to die when they're they're in good health but they get to be like seventy or eighty and all have aneurisms just drop dead well that's could be worse i think yeah i think you know that's pretty good way to go if i could live until seventy or eighty and have an aneurism and drop dead i'd probably i'd be happy yeah i i think that might be sufficient might be sufficient yeah that's that's the worst part um seems to me that a lot of times people wind up in nursing homes who tend to survive major things like strokes or uh um-hum heart attacks that sort of thing and then you know they can't really help themselves so they have to be cared for yeah i mean it seems like in a case like that you'd need more help than ever to uh right to more more support and some way to live a fulfilling life and it doesn't seem like those people are getting it yeah i mean it seems like they'd be almost just you know better off just withholding care to some some degree well it's always a tough question you know i mean with not only the elderly but sick people in general you know when do you withhold and when do you not yeah yeah well it seems to me it's a little bit easier with the elderly because you know at least they've lived a life you would think yeah i mean you'd think hey the clock's bound to run out at some point and uh yeah yeah it's something it's something like fifty percent or greater of all health care expenses are in the last five years of life yeah um you my wife is a nurse and she tells me stories about uh so uh-huh the things that people are put through the so heroic measures they're put through when they're very sick some of them are very old and some aren't that uh right um-hum everyone really knows isn't going to make a real difference but they're sort of left not knowing what else to do than everything they can do right yeah seems like uh unfortunately that many of those people who are put through those if they'd uh let their wishes be known ahead of time frequently they wouldn't have been interested in heroic measures and yeah my wife has certain certain wishes that she doesn't want certain procedures done and i just hope i can remember what they are it comes time to deal with it if that's the case then um-hum yeah well i don't know my wife's a medical student and uh you know we got some of the uh Journal of the AMA and American Medical News thing and it seems like that physicians unless they're in writing or video tape or something uh-huh um-hum um-hum that they're kind of in a  okay i guess we're on uh capital punishment uh my my feeling by the way is that i think there is a need for capital punishment i don't think it ought to be applied to every crime obviously but there is a need how do you feel about it oh i believe there is you know there is a need for it like you said it shouldn't be applied to every every crime you know uh-huh uh uh i feel like you know they need to instead of giving the people on on uh you know like death row and stuff just leaving them there and sit there and make taxpayer pay for it i think they ought to do something about it yeah i think it does does get uh strung out too long that they uh they keep people there ten twelve years uh uh that seems to be the norm yeah um i i don't know how effective a deterrent it is when when that happens uh but more and more people are being executed for crimes i think down in Texas uh just today or yesterday didn't you have one an execution down there yeah we had uh one just yeah couple days ago yeah well they haven't executed anybody in uh in our state of New Hampshire since i think nineteen forty four or somewhere around that time frame it's it's been a long time yeah we do have the death penalty but uh they don't use it very much instead they sentence them to life and uh we end up as you say uh fitting the footing the bill the next forty or fifty years yeah that's what i think that they need to do something to change that because i don't think the taxpayers should have to pay for that guy to stay in the stay in there for life you know i think one interesting question would be uh uh you know as far as circumstances uh i think we agree if somebody you know is involved with a premeditated murder or you know a cold blooded first degree murder they deserve the death penalty that's in my opinion i don't know how do you feel about that if they take another human life you know and they've they've planned to do this or they're doing it for pay don't you think that deserves the the death penalty it sure does now how about drug dealers where they don't directly take a life you know it's not like they're pulling the the the trigger on a gun or or something like that what do you think about uh major drug dealers getting the death penalty well that not they're partly you know they're a lot responsible for it because they're the ones selling the drugs to the to the uh dealers out on the street you know and i think they they need to get capital the capital punishment i think capital punishment in those instances is probably even more effective than for uh the just the common street criminal that kills somebody yeah that person probably isn't thinking too much about it but these major drug dealers uh you know they got some brains they wouldn't be in the business if they didn't have and if they're threatened with the death penalty i think it might make a difference on them oh yeah i think it would too you know sometimes i think they ought to just take them out and shoot them and just you know but uh that's my opinion on some of the cases uh-huh because i think drugs is a bad deal and stuff that's right it certainly ruins a lot of lives uh whereas a you know somebody that uh is holding up a bank and shoots somebody effects a fairly small circle of people i mean the relatives and friends of the person that was killed yeah but but a drug dealer a major drug dealer is effecting what thousands of lives oh yeah and in effect causing some of them to die um-hum and you know it's especially i just saw something on TV tonight on the news about LSD in a school over in Dallas so oh is that right yep so it's effecting it's way down there in the high schools and stuff and uh-huh i think drug dealers need to be sent to prison for life imprisonment and stuff you know or given the death penalty yeah and and uh-huh that LSD even gets into the grade schools when they sell these uh stickers they look like uh i guess they're dots on a piece of paper or something yeah and uh you know that's really that's really a crime to give it to the young kids like that well i guess we've talked about all we can on this topic what do you think uh yeah okay well it's been nice talking with you hope you have a nice day good evening talk to you later bye-bye okay you too all right bye  pretty good pretty good so we're talking about drug testing in the work place huh drug testing in the work place um i've been tested a few times just before pre drug employment but that's about it i've never had random drug testing yeah we have random drug testing at in my business but i've never been uh never had to do it yeah yeah they started that about a year ago and i think it's mostly for the oh really what the field people that you know drive trucks and heavy machinery that kind of stuff uh-huh but uh they they have done some testing around our office mostly after lunch looking for people drinking uh drinking beer and stuff at lunch time at least that's oh they do with alcohol pardon they do it with alcohol yeah yeah they they they'll check for alcohol oh i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine now once once you start doing that stuff you sort of you're sort of stuck into uh checking for the whole the whole thing huh that's interesting what type of field of work are you in yeah it's a i'm in the oil business yeah oh in the oil business okay and you work in the office around yeah i work in the office so uh it's pretty pretty safe environment uh-huh yeah see i work in the automotive air bag industry where we make the safety bags for the cars and we work around around a lot of explosives uh-huh uh-huh well that sounds like kind of an important job to be uh straight on yeah so that's you know i'm all for it because the well the type of environment i work in you know working they're working with explosives and so they could blow up the whole well they have safety features with each of the explosives they use but still it can be dangerous yeah yeah well i i i agree i think that uh you know under certain circumstances especially when you're working in in high risk uh uh industries where you can really hurt other people that that you need to have that kind of stuff yeah you know if it's as long as it's not abused uh you know random you know as long as it's random and and the individual's rights are uh are protected i don't have that big a problem with it now do they fire them or do they well see this is it this is where i start having my problems with my company i work for a private company and and the the policy is something like um-hum see if i can restate this correctly now if you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem then you're eligible for company counseling uh-huh but if they catch you if you test positive for a a controlled substance then you get fired oh wow so it you know it's sort of one of these little catch twenty twos huh that's i think our policy is that all right it's probably the same thing i'm not really sure because anyway i don't have the yeah really it's one of those things that you read once and then if you if you're not worried about it you just forget about it that's right but i know they do have counseling and that they do give you a second chance but i'm not sure if if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in yeah yeah our yeah our company's a little tougher on the second chance i mean if if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in then they ought to you know go out of the way i think a little bit more to uh to help you get you help get you rehabilitated to you know to get get back at your job uh-huh but uh when you're not when you're a private company the rules don't always apply uh do you think it works very good with that random do you think it limits the well it's it's hard for me to to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment and you know it's not i guess i haven't haven't run into anybody that's that's had a problem that's that's been a problem uh-huh uh so i guess you know i guess it works uh much like uh well shoot like any lottery i mean everybody's got an equal chance to get picked uh-huh so uh i'd rather have that than you know say well this week the A's and B's are going to be in and next week C's and D's are going to come in you could time it just right yeah right right i've met one employee i know when i was working with he had alcohol on his breath and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not that'd be just as dangerous yeah well especially around uh you know equipment machinery and stuff huh that's true you know i've i've gone out and had a had a beer at lunch time but not to excess in any case um-hum do they give any limits on alcohol or is it uh i don't remember to tell you the truth i don't think they do um well i they must i mean gee whiz that just shows you how much i've been paying attention because i i really don't know i'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask well you know you can take some of that that testing a little bit too far uh there was a company in Houston that they did uh an unannounced drug sweep of the of their company oh uh-huh oh it was it was it was an unannounced sweep of of it was not only drugs  well uh i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in in specific uh very specific in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing uh-huh um i don't really think that it's uh too many i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say well we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're uh you know worthy of working for us i really don't see that that's a very very valid uh thing for a company to say and i personally i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body yeah uh i guess i basically agree that uh do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody just knowing that they have take drugs i mean suppose they found out some other way well i think i think what you i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs yeah so there's too many cases where it can you know there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing i don't think there's any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs so we don't want him here yeah uh like i said some industries though i think it'd be very necessary i wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i'm flying in an airplane yeah but uh i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that it's such a a big deal i mean if your employer's not going to trust you or you know it i just i think it's a whole trust issue i just can't see it have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug tested or uh yeah i have been yeah i have once too so i i mean i was very offended by by the whole process i mean it's uh very humiliating and i mean i'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs but i uh i am totally against that sort of a uh yeah i mean it's it's a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before i'm going to talk to you yeah i had it during a job interview and i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them right to do this and i'm just like well uh i'm not even going to think much about it yeah if you're gonna treat me with this much respect even before right you've gotten to know me right that that's basically my opinion on it right there is that it's just you know i did i it was in the same sort of situation as it was a job interview and then you had a physical where you were drug tested and it's i just i mean i know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know been hired by a corporation which uh you know i really The other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy as in my it's my bodily fluid and i don't really want you to look at it or or something pretty basic like that just to the fact that uh-huh i don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what it's employees are doing when they're not at work i mean the during the eight hours during the day when they're supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also yeah well like you say i mean if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors right right and i mean if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem then they'll notice it for other reasons that's exactly right yeah and also i just think it it gets a lot i'm a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies and i think that it just moves down along a line that that i really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work when you know there's already talk of people well we're not going to hire you if you smoke well you know i i can see how they can say in the work place we you don't want them to smoke but when somebody leaves work i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their lifestyle at all well do you think it's should be illegal for an employer to do this or uh i really think it should be except as i've mentioned twice now in the specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where it's just vital that a person is clear minded at all times yeah and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that hum it should it's kind of the big brother syndrome i mean i just anything like that just kind of scares me i tend to to view it even though i don't think i'd work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend an employer's rights as opposed to an individual's uh in addition to an individual's rights but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to right and if they say they don't want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that right uh and i don't really  oops hello i pressed the button one so we're recording right now i'm sorry hello that's okay i'm Bill from Raleigh okay and i'm Melanie from Harrisville Utah oh so another one from a different state besides Texas yeah um okay Bill we're talking about family reunions right okay um have you ever had to plan a family reunion uh yes and no it wasn't really a family a planning one but it was kind of uh it was a birthday and i brought a lot of family together then oh uh-huh and how did you feel it went it went pretty good i'm i've worked in hotels so i i kind of know how to do these things i used to you know oh all of this planning and and getting together and such um oh let's see what else usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday and uh-huh and it's all of like she she comes from a big family she has like seven sisters i think oh boy and they show up and all their kids and then all she has uh i have like uh let's see she has four sons and two daughters and uh-huh they show up and all their kids so it's a pretty big reunion it's about two hundred people maybe oh my word oh well what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together um the probably the biggest challenge was uh getting a place where everyone you know could eat comfortably and and everything uh uh-huh i guess probably the most helpful thing was that uh for the rent uh we rented like a a rescue squad building or something like that and uh oh uh-huh each one of the everybody that showed up donated donated some money for the rent and for for like soft drinks and and so nobody like really got stuck with the bill each person in the family you know brought a dish or some oh oh that's good uh-huh and then did you have a main meal or did everyone just bring it was just potluck uh-huh it was kind of potluck you know everybody brought their specialties i guess you would say yeah yeah show off a little bit yeah and of course my grandmother's food was as always gone first because she's such a great cook oh oh now how old is she uh she's eighty six oh goodness is she pretty spry is she you know pretty now she does she looks probably like she's in her early sixties oh wow and if she didn't have arthritis she'd get around better than me as a matter of fact uh-huh oh oh well that's neat that she's in good health and that at that age oh yeah uh my nickname for her is honey woman that's what i call her yeah oh really well that sounds fun well i i had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago and there were we sent out five hundred uh announcements because our family is quite large like your your family there and so that was a real challenge and i was president of our family reunion for two years and i wasn't sure i appreciated that duty for two years in a row but i found that advance planning was the key to success uh also one thing that's helpful and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever but most of all my family lives like in the same county so it's just kind of like get on the telephone and uh-huh oh well that was wonderful though it's so and such days from such and such date and everybody just shows up oh oh well that is that is helpful yeah our family ranges from oh goodness well Australia i have a brother lives in Australia to uh Boise Idaho and and uh all kinds of places i would say you're spread out then we are uh my my immediate family you know my my parents and my brothers and sisters i guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever because my dad was in the Army and we were oh we were pretty strung out all over but since they've moved back to Carolina's uh we still are the only ones do not live in in Anson County in oh i live in Raleigh and then my my parents live in Greenville and i have one brother and his wife live in Greenville and um another brother that lives in outside of Fayetteville so i mean we're we're uh-huh we're spread out but everybody else is centralized in in my home town Waynesboro so boy oh my gosh nobody moves away except us yeah i got out as soon as i graduated they must really like it there yeah oh just like this town is too small for me good-bye oh you're ready to move on to big  okay you wanna start yeah i might as well uh one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution is the uh this this the ozone layer uh uh uh issue uh i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of freon different types of freons and it uh rather bothers me that uh i was in in effect uh contributing to the delinquency of the the environment so to speak uh-huh yeah now that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago right right and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven twelve and thirteen in in in that area was because they were inexpensive uh they could be made uh you know cheap inexpensive and lots of it uh and in that and its properties were great uh with uh the machinery didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to uh get your heating and cooling cycles to work so uh-huh so have they stopped that practice now well course there's only a a tremendous number of a refrigerators and freon excuse me refrigerators and freezers both commercial and residential uh utilizing freon twelve and of course the the new cars i guess starting with nineteen nineteen ninety three will not have freon twelve in their systems but uh there's you know there's the ton of after market machines and et cetera et cetera yeah yeah and that's got me very concerned you know highly concerned that uh it's gonna be quite a while before we can uh undo this now that could spawn several good industries and help pull us out of this recession but you got to have people that can make you know earn a salary to pay for this conversion so we're so i see us in a kind somewhat of a catch twenty two unless we unless the banks or industry and or the government go together and and come up with a way to uh have us uh as a an unemployed the part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into uh the new nonpolluting uh compound oh because as i say there is a there's a tremendous well how many uh uh families own a refrigerator and then do you know that number and then how many own a a freezer separate from uh-huh and how many people especially here in Texas own cars and trucks with air conditioning yeah i mean this is there there are people that that make it have a thriving business uh that do nothing but heating and air conditioning on on automobiles and trucks and uh the only reason i didn't uh get into that more when i was had my little business was because uh most of your uh air conditioning in in on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the N-th degree uh-huh and i mean so uh that's why i stayed in stayed more towards towards uh uh and that's a polluting polluting type deal too is the excessive um you know uh petroleum products in your engine bay and so forth and the dirt and grit and the those two mixed together with with water and uh really make a uh make a mess um yeah yeah i hate to see a car going down the street or even a truck or bus for that matter that that's putting out a lot of dark um-hum smoke and i know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of cars but that that particular bothers me right well most most of the time when you see bus uh you know the buses with the diesel that's uh those are carbon particles and uh carbon dioxide and water vapor uh-huh uh because when you when diesel diesel is burned it's it you know diesel fuel is burned in a in a in the diesel engine it's burned so completely that you don't have any uh uh nitrous oxides uh or oxides of nitrogen uh to uh form oh because of by virtue of the very combustion process of the diesel engine because diesel oil is uh is not very volatile um-hum you know where gasoline if you leave a little pail of gasoline out before long it's gone yeah diesel is going to be around because it doesn't evaporate easily and it's got uh you know it's it's latent heat is high but it's slow burning at at uh normal pressures that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios oh i see as the as the air is heated you know by virtue of the compression process to like one to nineteen or nineteen to one ratio um-hum uh-huh and so if it the car sucks in uh fifty degrees  so um do you have children of your own yes uh how old are they they range in age from twenty four down to five ah so have you had to deal with this uh child care question yourself not not really my wife has provided the child care up to now uh uh-huh uh that certainly is the most straightforward that's the easiest one yeah do you have children i do i have uh one son who will be three in May and uh we're expecting another in May and have you been into child care no not yet although my wife stays home also uh we're starting to look into maybe a preschool a couple of hours a day for the older one next year uh-huh uh just to give him a little more time with other kids and to give my wife a little more time with the the baby right uh but otherwise i i mean even just looking for that has been kind of difficult finding one that you really like and that doesn't have some uh major disadvantages well i think one of the things you kind of have to do is decide what you want out of day care or out of preschool you know do you want a real academic one or do you want one that's more for socialization purposes um-hum um-hum uh you know i i think those are some sort of critical issues we see a lot i see a lot of programs that are really geared to get the kids ready for school and i see others that are sort of more oriented towards fun for the kids yes that's true that's true uh and i would tend to lean toward the fun at this age me too the last thing they need at that age is academics yeah i mean they'll get it eventually anyhow uh how how old are your kids when they started some sort of school well we generally with most of our kids there were well with our oldest one they didn't have kindergarten in Texas um-hum and so we sent her to a private kindergarten and that was really her first exposure um uh-huh with the others we've either with some friends done a a sort of Mother's Day out kind of thing where they took turns uh-huh a couple of times a week or we've actually put them into a little preschool at about age four just for a year's kind of socialization and again to give my wife a little bit of relief uh-huh uh-huh yeah it sounds like we'll be doing something similar and my wife was thinking of uh starting up a little preschool yeah maybe just with a few other mothers and it would be sort of a mom it would end up being a mom's day off thing because they would take turns um we did that until our very last one and then my wife kind of said you know i'm ready for a break uh-huh oh so that's quite a spread twenty four to five oh we have eight children so wow that's great there's a lot of space in between i mean there's not an awful lot of space in between them um so did now the twenty four year old was was nineteen when the five year old was born has she been at home uh she was in college actually when the baby was born uh-huh what kind of what's their relationship like very good uh-huh oh it would be very interesting i mean old enough i mean really no sibling rivalry there i would expect no and she kind of really wanted him i mean she wanted us to have him so she was real excited about it uh-huh uh-huh and uh she has a child of her own now that's just a couple of years younger than he is oh yeah i always had friends in school who had an uncle uh hold it no that child is wait a minute this should be very simple my son is a that child is your son's nephew yeah right that's right yeah i always had friends who had an uncle who was a year younger or the same age and i always thought that was neat well we didn't quite make that but came close so it doesn't yeah uh but they were pretty close at least compared to me and my uncle whose about forty years older yeah yeah um um do you plan to have more children no all said um now we've we're into the grand type child period now that's much better oh yeah i would think that would have a lot of rewards does your does your daughter live nearby they live about uh four hours from here they're in San Antonio oh well well that's accessible for a weekend um does she have to worry about child care yeah uh no right now she's staying home taking care of her kids or her husband is in school still uh-huh and uh so she works a little night job to help him through school and he stays home and takes care of the kids in the evening oh it sounds great so they've been able to work that out so far she doesn't wanna go back to work if she can avoid it uh-huh yeah yeah i wish i could stay home with the kid and me too um but it is nice to i mean i i find it it really gives me peace of mind to know that my wife is home with our son you know as as far as knowing what kind of care he's getting i don't know what you hear in California but you know there's a lot of  do you do for exercise do you do anything regularly i walk do you uh how often uh about every other day well that's good that's good no that's not very much really do you walk very far uh a couple miles yeah well that's that's not bad i mean i know um just probably in the last four or five months i've been able to pick up um i go to a gym and and uh ride the bike and do the what's called the stair master so that's uh i try to do that three or four times a week well have have you done that a long time um uh i i am uh uh i didn't i have a six month old baby he's my third one and didn't do it much while i was pregnant but um but the about at six weeks i really began picking it back up so i've been doing it at least for the last uh last five six months so but before that i did uh i did biking i like to swim a lot too so that sounds pretty good you're i you're better than i am i uh it's tough it is i i have purchased any number of well i say any number i've purchased three different uh types of exercise equipment uh mainly uh uh a rower and two different uh kinds of uh exercycles but uh i have teenagers and it drives me nuts when i get on and um-hum uh somebody's screwed the tension all the way up so you can hardly move yeah i bet well did you do you like the rowing rowing machine because i did that for a while and no i didn't like that i i didn't i just didn't feel like it was doing much for me and i don't i don't know if i wasn't doing it properly or what but i didn't i didn't feel like it was doing much except maybe i didn't like that i uh the uh like i say the maybe for my arms main problem with me is i've got to have something that's repeatable um-hum and uh walking is repeatable and bicycling is repeatable i i bicycle once in a while yeah yeah but if it's any kind of equipment then uh i have uh four kids at home and and they just there's a joy i think in changing the settings yeah and it takes me a while to get back into it so well so do you do you enjoy your walking or is it just because you have to exercise you know you need to exercise well there're two kinds one kind is where you just get out and you do it because you've got to do it and the other kind is yeah is uh actually most of the walking i've been doing these days is is just a bunch that i'm with uh uh a couple of people in my group who we just take off and walk uh uh over to the shopping center and walk through the shopping center and then come back which is about a two mile trip yeah so it's but it's a kind of sedentary job here i don't know about you but uh uh this job just involves sitting in in front of a keyboard all day long writing computer programs ah yeah well i i run after preschoolers at this point so is is that right so you get uh so you get more exercise than yeah than uh that's a fair amount of exercise by itself right well uh yes and no i mean i don't i mean you know we play around and fool around but i don't i don't ever feel you know i've i've really worked out but i i really have you know first going to the gym was really really tough and i've been doing it like early in the mornings before the kids wake up so but now it's you know i don't like to wake up but once i'm up i enjoy it and i enjoy the the challenge of seeing how much further i can get and um right now i'm you know increasing levels on the bike or increasing time on the the stair master and um so that's you know and i only have a certain amount of time i can do it and so it's okay how many calories can i burn at this in this amount of time so are these are these uh does this gear have some kind of a little uh electronic uh thing uh read out on it yeah um i i'm a member of President's and so the the cycle tells you how far you've you have uh levels that you can um ride on or walk on and it tells you you know how far you've walked or how far you've um biked and how many calories it's burned and you can set it up where you can be going up hills or you can be going just constant level and so it's  okay well hello Frances hello Paul um yeah i guess when i uh first i guess i have mixed feelings about this uh subject when i first heard about it um i thought it was kind of a neat way of uh screening uh uh screening for potential problems good way for companies to weed out people with drug problems but since then i've been hearing uh yeah well i read an article in the Wall Street Journal last year that talked about um the different results that they get from uh different labs and that uh many labs will give uh false positives especially some of the yes uh-huh the less expensive ones and that people have been denied employment on this basis well the reliability seems to not be too great um i don't know i'm kind of like you i have mixed feelings but all in all i think i'm for it uh i really do um yeah because we lose so much time and what have you with the the drug problem and it's just so prevalent nowadays that uh i think it's only fair for the uh employees or the employers to uh have some kind of guidelines to go by uh-huh but like anything else this can be misused yeah there's a i know some employers have had have been able to uh reduce some tremendous problems they've had with employee turnover health problems and accidents and theft and i understand that certain jobs like if you're driving a train or plane or something of course there'd be increased need for it uh-huh one thing that always kind of bugged me about it was uh there's they most of them don't test for actually the number one drug problem which of course is uh alcohol abuse right and of course that you know everybody talks about all the other drugs but uh i i understand alcohol is really still the number one health problem and the number one abused drug in in our country so it seems kind of too bad that that one's tolerated while other ones are are you know are the ones that they focus on well it is in every situation that uh alcohol is more acceptable to people it seems than the other quote drugs but uh it can do more harm with the uh i don't know we just seem to have a rash of drunk driving and killings around here lately and uh well see now in Texas uh didn't they only recently ban open containers in in vehicles a few years ago yes yes but we aren't very uh we aren't very hard even on the you know when they're picked up for drunk driving time after time again oh really this is a real problem here that they get a little slap on their wrists and there was one man here that had forty two DWI's oh man and the only reason they finally came down on him he finally did kill someone yeah and an innocent bystander and when looking back he had forty two convictions and yet he was still walking loose so we've got problem here with the alcohol especially that uh uh-huh right yeah yeah i expect possibly in Texas it's uh you know a an attorney knows they get in front of a jury and the jury will be thinking well i've done that before or he's just a good old boy you know the good old yeah good old boy stuff you know well this is yeah this is natural this is tell me what do you expect yeah right what else how else do you drive in your pickup down the highway yeah and i i'm afraid you know it may come out with some of these other drugs too that uh i know i have some friends whose children of uh you know it's they use cocaine uh-huh and it's acceptable it's becoming acceptable to them that well you know they're not um they're not hurting anyone else and i thought where have i heard this before and i'm afraid that's what we may be uh-huh facing in the very near future um-hum other than that i don't know because i don't drink and i don't do drugs and it's uh so neither is really acceptable to me well same here yeah yeah but uh then the work place it's just i don't know what is well we really infringing on other rights or their  okay Bill right yes okay Bill have you done much camping uh yes i'm a scoutmaster in Boy Scouts ah ha i camp uh every month uh camp at least one weekend and during the summer we camp uh two or three weeks a year oh well that that sounds good i'd say i camp quite a bit yes you do um now do you have a lot of mountain well you don't have mountains in Texas do you where do you find places to camp well uh we we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping oh and we uh we also uh carry all our equipment with us uh-huh and so we canoe down the river and then sleep on the river on one of the uh sand bars and then get up the next morning cook our breakfast and go down the river again oh oh my word well that sounds adventuresome well um i've done oh i would say quite a bit of camping mostly with my husband and i how about yourself um we have five children and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves so we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out and we have gone up into the mountains and uh not necessarily roughed it but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains well that's good and then the boys are our boys are old enough now they're twelve and eleven and so they're involved involved in the scouting and they do a lot of camping with the scouts um-hum and last year my one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week and so this year they'll both be going and so that's been real enjoyable for them great so what uh what kind of camping do they like best do they like it where they have tents and uh do they cook on stoves um yes they've well no actually they've i remember they have taken the the Dutch the heavy cast iron Dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire um-hum and i don't think they've taken the stoves um last year they camped in tents and this year i believe it will be in tents also uh-huh of course i imagine it gets cold in parts of Utah so uh-huh yeah it doesn't get very cold in Texas so lots of times we don't even take tents oh is that right we just use trail tarps oh and what does that consist of uh it's just a piece of material that has uh that has a lot of uh places where you can tie off to it and make it into a tent oh uh-huh uh like a uh they're very light weight and we use them when we go backpacking so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles then uh they're not very heavy see so you carry them with you and uh-huh oh they'll keep you dry or whatever yes uh see when when we go camping here we have to take our big huge heavy sleeping bags and lots of tents and i like to sleep on the air mattresses i don't am not my bones are getting so old so i like to i like to sleep on the mattresses um-hum um so have you had any adventures on your camping trips with encounters with wild animals or anything like that yes yes in fact uh um last month we went camping we saw a lot of deer oh uh in the morning and in the afternoon just deer everywhere my word jeez uh so uh but it even though uh it wasn't hunting season and we were with Boy Scouts so of course we don't uh want to go hunting uh-huh but we got to see a lot of deer oh um out and about and there's of course we see smaller animals all the time and uh one thing that is a big concern in the evening at night uh is uh make sure that all the food's put away and so forth oh because uh we have uh armadillos do you know what a armadillo is oh uh they're covered with like a heavy armor um-hum type stuff uh-huh and possums and uh raccoons my word and uh we have those uh creatures down here that they like to uh they like to go hunting for a a midnight snack uh-huh and so that that uh that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away oh but they won't necessarily attack a human or bite you or anything they will if you attack them oh but most time they run away from you uh-huh if if they if they see you're up you know uh-huh but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep oh my word so well that sounds a little less fierce than bears we we want to go  okay should begin okay all right uh i can begin this um basically i work for Honeywell in Minneapolis uh-huh and the the benefit program we have here is really quite good i'm i'm pretty pleased with it they cover uh just about everything vision dental medical uh-huh uh you name it and for me this is the first job i've had where they've covered that much so i'm pretty satisfied myself uh-huh um what's your situation i i work for the University of New Hampshire and uh oh our benefits package isn't uh isn't quite as good in in some ways uh you know overall i'm satisfied with it we don't have the vision care we do have the health care and the uh and the medical or the dental um-hum uh are you a professor there no i work in i'm in a on the professional administrative and technical staff and i effectively i run the telephone switch at uh at the University of New Hampshire oh i see okay uh so the uh the the benefits uh probably the main thing i like about the benefits is the uh the uh very generous vacation time and sick time we get oh no doubt we get we get fifteen days a year sick time and uh we get twenty four days a year right from the day one when you start work you get twenty four days a year uh time off right oh that's good yeah that's one of the things i guess i would change about Honeywell is uh yeah i used to work with the Army Research Institute and being a uh a government organization you got quite a few holidays off right but here you don't get that you maybe get two or three a year uh-huh so it's really unless you unless you have some vacation time or some some sick leave or whatever um you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time so um-hum that's that's kind of a drawback i think but uh i don't know what do you consider most important you think in terms of of the different benefits well i think uh the the health care of course is an important in has to be the single most important benefit um-hum and uh the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing uh you know i'm i'm a little disturbed about that but i think that's a national trend and i don't know that uh i don't know what the solution is to it it's bigger than just the benefits part yeah yeah i don't know if you saw on Twenty Twenty the other night they uh they basically reviewed Oregon's plan or The Oregon Plan toward uh nationalizing health care and that kind of thing uh-huh right it's kind of an interesting plan it's kind of cold though they've essentially made up a list of uh oh all the different uh medical medical maladies that you can have and they basically made a cutoff about six hundred and eighty seven and below will not be covered by by uh subsidized health care and and the ones above would oh yeah um-hum huh so it's kind of like drawing this line and and if you have it great if you don't you're kind of out of luck uh-huh but um it was an interesting show hum i think you're right i think health care is probably the the most pressing right uh the pressing one but i'll tell you i i i don't mind having dental you know sometimes dental costs can be um just about as expensive if not more and i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical right um-hum but i'm not sure that's that's widely followed any more i'm not sure how how does uh University of New Hampshire handle it well we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental uh depending and and the cost between them is very is very little i think it costs me something like five dollars a a month for the dental plan um but it pays uh a substantial amount i mean the examinations and and uh checkups every year or every six months are free great and uh it it covers the bulk of the dental expenses is that uh let me interrupt is that the same for both uh professors and and also staff and administration is that generally across the board do you think or uh yes it is the the benefits plan is different for operating for what we call operating staff which are considered to be uh clerical personnel accountants things like that as opposed to what they call the P A T staff which i belong to right um-hum and but the main i think the the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody and the retirement plan but uh-huh the main difference is in the uh the way sick time is accrued and and vacation time is accrued oh okay uh for the operating staff it's on a seniority it's uh you know based on how long they've worked there right uh that determines how much uh vacation time they get yeah i'm kind of interested because i'm actually that's the route i'd like to take when i finally get my degree um-hum is to uh is to teach in university uh-huh i'm a doctoral student in Florida right now oh but um yeah that's that's interesting that's one of the things i'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits they would uh they would cover and things like that college programs uh belong to this T I A A uh C R E F retirement fund oh is that right right and in the case of the University of New Hampshire uh  all right uh did you uh did you have to wait very long excuse me did you have to wait very long yeah oh i forgot my i i had to dig through my suitcase and find my personal identification number okay all right so uh they had are Americans still paying too much too many taxes that's a that's an easy one are we supposed to spend five minutes on this yeah i yeah well no i mean yes oh you think you that we are paying too much in taxes yeah yeah i don't think we're paying a lot too much i uh i think we're paying i i i used to live in Sweden and uh i know that they pay a lot more than we do um-hum yeah it's even higher uh tax rate over there on income yeah so i guess we should be grateful that it's as low as it is right are are you you're a native you're from uh the United States yes i i'm from Idaho actually but you worked over there for a couple of year yeah yeah i was so when i was living in Sweden i got uh an impression kind of an impression of their system which is socialistic yes and so they everything is subsidized by their government their their taxes are higher than ours so i guess i shouldn't be i shouldn't complain so much i uh i do get concerned that there's that there's a lot of uh government spending on things like um things that that don't really benefit anyone outside of the congressman's district who proposes the measure like restoring some old ship or something like that right you talking about special projects in the US in the US you mean now it right okay yeah it's true i feel that um you know i don't feel that uh we're paying too much taxes provided we get the right services for what we pay for but i think we've kind of gotten away from that um for what we get we're paying too much i would say you wouldn't mind paying that much if you were getting that equivalent value for it right or if if things i didn't feel that things were wasted i can go for uh you know through uh red tape through waste you know uh money a lot of money is lost and how much effect are you getting out of your dollar and how much goes to just waste yeah i think i have to agree although i pay an awful lot of taxes because i'm single i'm in a reasonably high tax bracket so um it seems very expensive to me for what i get right right typically um you don't get a whole lot no although i get some things that i very much appreciate i mean i don't i don't have a dictator i don't i'm not reporting for a dictator i live in a free economy and so i mean in a sense i don't mind spending money on and uh welfare on reasonable amounts of welfare i don't mind spending money on and things like highways and stuff i don't mind spending on well right a lot of federal money goes for highways but speaking of um people who are on welfare i know one of the presidents Patrick Buchanan has a idea that says that if he's president if you don't get a job within two years then you're taken off welfare so to eliminate people who continuously uh kind of leech off the system you know you you have you get to spend your time but then you're off huh don't know if i agree with that or not i mean because there's people that just plain i don't know what the percentage is but there is some percentage of people out there that just cannot get a job for whatever reason although two years that does sound like quite a while yes i don't know what do you think of that one well i i i guess i'm not i don't like to make hard and fast rules that you have to live by because there's always exceptions but i think something has to be done some type of reform measure he certainly seems to be looking at the right issue uh-huh yeah um one thing that i've kind of been following that i i'd really i'm kind of waiting for it and i maybe after the presidential elections we'll see it and that is for President Bush to uh see if he can see if he can uh give the line item veto a try right and uh apparently he's been waiting for a test case he's been waiting for quite a while hm but i think it'd be fascinating to see him try vetoing some of the one of these rider bills that's that's clearly a waste of money and to see how Congress reacts to that yes that'd be quite an exciting battle yeah um-hum yeah i don't know what's your situation i live uh i'm a property owner in the city limits of Atlanta uh-huh and we get taxed tremendously tremendously on our property taxes and a lot of that money doesn't go for what the original intent of property taxes was um i pay for a a local hospital uh Grady Hospital where a lot of indigent people are go and get free care uh-huh and i pay for schools which you know maybe homeowners should pay for that but i i and a lot of other things  okay Toby this is Brian White and our topic i guess tonight is on capital punishment and how we feel about that um if you don't mind uh how do you feel about capital punishment well my position in general is that i'm supportive of it but i'm not supportive of the way that it's currently administered okay um it takes so long with uh the appeals process uh that it's uh uh simply impossible to say that it's that it's consistent administration of justice uh uh-huh if if the penalty could be executed swiftly and surely upon people who deserved it when there was uh evidence uh beyond a a reasonable doubt that they had committed a a crime worthy of it then i think it should be done uh-huh and that way it can be a deterrent a deterrent that's right but as it stands now it's not a deterrent we just had a fellow here in our county who has he's been on death row for seventeen years and just had his sentence overturned for the third time uh on a technicality uh-huh everybody knows he did it yeah this last technicality was simply because the language of the decision handed down by the jury uh explaining uh saying that he should get the death penalty was not precisely as it is stated in the statute that it should be uh-huh oh great and that was it i mean it was a a very simple i mean they fully intended to give him the death penalty uh they had a unanimous decision but when they drafted the uh decision the response yeah uh they did it wrong and it was just a very minor very minor uh mistake but it was enough for uh the state supreme court to say that the uh that the decision was invalid and that they had to empanel a new jury to consider the death penalty again uh that kind of thing uh and and and the way that people search and search for those kind of things just uh just disgusts me yes and with uh with with it being that way it ends up costing us so much money so much more to have the death penalty than to not have it that uh i'm almost inclined to say do away with it uh-huh the the problem that i see is uh what do we have instead uh-huh here in Georgia uh we don't have a a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole yes if someone gets life in prison they are generally released in seven years if they behave well right and we have had people get out in seven years and commit uh another murder uh that just shouldn't be so but i say uh i could tolerate getting rid of the death penalty if we could have life without the possibility of parole yes right right i tend to agree with you uh i'm kind of uh torn between two items however i i definitely believe believe in due process that if a person is found guilty so that we're not ramrodding a a guilty verdict on them that it's uh up for review in uh the appeal process however i tend to agree with you that well i don't tend to agree with i definitely agree with you that there are people that are going to make sure that every T is crossed every I is dotted and to make sure that everything is just right otherwise you know someone gets off on a technicality now yeah not only in the courts is that costing us money and millions and millions of dollars and wasting our taxpayers and uh clogging up the courts but also when the uh the detectives the homicide detectives and so forth when they're researching when they are gathering the evidence they're they're bending over backwards uh in typically what i believe is an open and shut case where the guy is guilty there are seven eyewitnesses they saw it happen they have testified what happened um there's video tape of it they yeah exactly exactly and the guy is as sound mind and and so forth he's he's not an idiot uh he wasn't acting i i don't know you know in that case yeah we're we're spending money in the in the judicial system we're spending money in the law enforcement area trying to verify all this kind of information and the and the individual's guilty i believe that if we have cash capital punishment that it should be executed swiftly that it should uh be taken care of not after seven levels of appeal but after a couple levels appeal of appeal uh under certain certain circumstances um-hum those circumstances would be  think about what nursing home well my parents were both in them uh-huh and my father-in-law and it's a tough decision to make yeah because boy it really confines the uh the people um-hum and uh usually they don't care for it and kind of put you on a guilt trip yeah but uh have you had any experience with them well uh this my grandmother in fact uh has a personal care home and she keeps a couple of elderly ladies in her home yeah and uh i live i live with her and so uh it's it's uh my mother also does the same thing and uh it's uh i think the quality of care they get is a a lot better uh yeah and a lot more personal but uh but it's still still not like home no but uh i think it's uh quite a bit better than than a nursing home i i've just seen right people just go down hill when they uh go into a nursing home yeah that seems to be uh but uh you know and it's hard to really know what kind of a home is run yeah unless you really know someone that's in there yeah and you have to kind of take that with a grain of salt too yeah that uh yeah they may say it's real bad uh just because they don't like it in there yeah whereas it's you know usually pretty good uh uh the one my father-in-law was in had uh oh God entertainment every afternoon of some you know bingo or cards or whatever uh-huh well that's good yeah and uh and it's easy to check out the meals you know just go up there during uh meal time if you can stand it yeah because they don't eat that too well yeah and uh go uh always you always have to check it for cleanliness too i'm sorry what was that well you have to make sure they're clean oh yeah and they just had a incident in uh Dallas here um-hum where the guy's suing the nursing home he came in at ten in the morning check on his mom um-hum and she was sick and uh went up to the front desk and said what's wrong with my mom and they said what is she sick we didn't know that and here she died two hours later uh oh yeah so you know and well there's an awful lot of variables in them yeah yeah i've seen some good ones and uh i've seen some uh my other grandmother was in one and it was i guess they it wasn't too bad but she uh she was a good way away from her family and uh kind of by herself there and it was it i didn't really like going there at all it was it was not a pleasant experience but uh i think there're some good ones out there's some here in Atlanta that are closing down it's oh apparently a shaky business right now well i think Medicare and Medicaid payments are uh kind of tightening up on it yeah but uh you know in some of them some of them try so darn hard but caring for an elderly person who might be forgetful yeah is ever ending yeah it is uh one of the ladies my grandmother has is apparently showing some signs of Alzheimer's and uh she'll my grandmother'll put her to bed and uh she'll get up you know anywhere from five to ten times and wonder where the bedroom is and you know that kind of thing so well it's around the clock care yeah it uh it takes a lot of patience yeah an awful lot but and and gentleness too yeah she she's she's pretty good with them though she does a real good job and uh oh i you know i would i would probably throw up my hands and quit but she just you know turn around put her put her back to bed yeah you know which is good so i i hope i can provide that kind of care for my grandmother you know she's still going pretty strong but uh uh i i don't think i would wanna turn her over to a nursing home i i'd like to be in and i think that's the position of a lot of people but they can't afford it you know costs a bunch my mother-in-law is uh eighty two and we'd probably put her in the same home that  oh okay Karen you're you're first okay i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is like the room for advancement you know not to get in like in a dead end job uh-huh and plus for me it's uh i mean like medical and you know uh benefits and dental they're also important okay yeah i guess one of the differences i see is uh working for a university uh there is room for advancement but not so much so our in uh quite a highly unionized environment and then also in an in administrative association so there is a um progressive path but not being in the say the commercial sector the motivation isn't there for a lot of people um uh like are they like well pretty much trained for a specific job and that what's their hired for and then uh really just just very little variation from there yeah somewhat that but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have uh a broader scope for rewarding people for uh their performances um-hum um so that's in in our situation where we're dealing with an institution uh it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance um-hum and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution perhaps somewhat even with the business uh but i agree you know the uh medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses for working for a large organization and also the uh security aspect for long term employment uh well you know that's kind of interesting though because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore i use to think that you know after you worth you mean security job security job security yes um that use to be i think a couple of years ago but i don't know if it is so much anymore in fact they we just had a lay off in what November i guess uh-huh but um it wasn't necessarily i mean you know some people had been there a long time yeah uh we're seeing that here as well like in some of the large oil companies there has been massive layoffs um-hum uh so i i think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world um-hum in uh institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses we need to cut back that's what we do um-hum and there's no doubt yeah but yeah and institutionally like here at the university oh if there is a cut back well gee it's not where it necessarily is needed it's where it's most expedient which expedient yeah that's exactly it yeah where the most dollar what it where it you know cuts back the most well in one sense sense for us it's where it makes the least noise which means it's often the lowest support type roles oh oh see yeah so we end yeah i think that's one of the things too you get too many management people you know it's very easy yeah and it's very easy for them to say oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know yeah and then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time when those people aren't there anymore right because it's the support people that are providing the speed for it yeah um-hum yeah but so what else do you think is important well the uh uh that's that's maybe the majority of the importance i guess uh yeah because my perspective is from an institution uh the there is not much incentive for innovativeness because the the the limitation for reward is is very severe um-hum um-hum but if you're in the corporate world i think there is considerable motivation for uh i guess in innovation although he the you know the more complex your structure the uh less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through um-hum but uh i think there is uh it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's uh things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of your efforts i think probably in a smaller yeah i was going to say more it's more personal for one thing you probably have a better team uh cooperation or team playing atmosphere right probably where as in a bigger corporation sometimes i think you think you're just a number you know yeah you end up being your own person um-hum and uh if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up well then that's their problem and um-hum you know you really whereas yeah in a smaller i think you'd be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished you know yeah yeah it becomes the organization instead of person being uh you know a part of the individual themselves um-hum  okay i think yes yes i'm sure that it let's see i didn't i didn't hear the message that it says you make the uh maybe i didn't press it hard enough let's try again okay hum well it it just that that uh recording would begin when the person who called presses right okay so so i will just assume that we are being recorded now i thought that they had a confirmation message when that occurred but perhaps not anyway i did press let me press one once again one but okay well i'll i'll take it that that did it okay so um the answer to that well maybe i should answer the question first since i have had so long to think about it um i uh use uh a program on my Macintosh which is called Dollars and Cents actually it hails from the bay area where you're from and uh oh i'm not in San Francisco i'm in Frisco Texas oh Frisco Texas uh gee i don't even know where are you Raleigh North Carolina Raleigh North Carolina i thought you said Rowlett we have a little town out here yes okay you know where Dallas is i see okay well anyway it doesn't hail from the area where you are but uh uh anyway uh so so anyway i use this a personal personal accounting program on my Macintosh to keep track of expenses but it also has a budget feature but i don't find it very useful because it makes all kinds of assumptions that aren't the case in my situation so i use the the little spread sheets for that i i i don't know actually i think most people who are in the series are a little bit familiar with computers but if you're not let me know and i will give more explanation oh okay i am familiar i am familiar with computers okay so have you do you do you use a computer to do your budgeting no we don't my husband uh takes care of our finances and he just uh just does it all all manually he keeps uh a book sort of um-hum he uh doesn't keep it on the computer i work with computers and we have one at home but he doesn't use it for that i found that it was uh you well you have a lot more information if you use a computer because you just can't keep track of everything manually you'll never go back through the old slips and see what your electric bill was and so forth but right if if you can just print it out it gives you a lot better feel for how you stand compared to last year um and that is a software program that was written for your uh i mean that you for Macintosh yes just for Macintosh um it's called Dollars and Cents and actually the leading program is Managing Your Monies by Andrew Tobias but i used that one year and it was so awful that i just gave up too much detail excuse me was it too much detail to it it was well it would bring up a new screen for everything you know you you um you would make one entry like for example if you were reconciling your check account and you wanted to change a transaction let's say you wanted to add in interest or put in a fee or something it took about three screens to do that and you could only see the one transaction you were working on all the earlier transactions were hidden it was just it it you just primitive yeah it had tunnel vision i mean it had a lot of features but they were all so hard to use that i never never really used any of them so uh i i i read since then though that they've redesigned redesigned uh redesigned the interface so probably it's a little better uh than it was before um so um do you do you do a uh a yearly budget or a monthly budget or uh i am not sure right now i think he is keeping he has it uh kind of a forecast out for oh about the next uh eighteen months or so he keeps track of all of um you know the the payments that are due when and uh what what pays off when and uh of course he knows ahead of time about when the uh home owner's is due and when the car insurance is due and such like that and he just right sort of keeps uh i guess you would say a running record of it so that he he knows at what point uh we are going to be able to to have uh some extra money um-hum uh yeah i try and uh i think that one of the things i've i've worked on is cutting down on the number of transactions uh so so i i instead of paying bills monthly if they are not very much uh i just pay enough for two months when i pay one month's bill and that way i have to send you know substantially fewer number of things out in the mail which saves a lot of time um-hum and uh uh gee i pretty my pay my cable TV annually you get a discount for doing that they give you the thirteenth month of month of service free if they remember well that's nice but they say uh they always forget you every year they mess it up and forget to give me credit or or or shall i say five out of the last six years so i called in and uh at first i got kind of upset but now now you expect it oh yeah now i know they are going to do that um  uh well we have a budget we go by every pay check since i have been in the service we get paid twice a month so that's what i go by well we uh we try it's it's not as easy as i had thought it would be but last year i started keeping a total of our expenses and and where they were all going and i have uh a budget book that i use um-hum if you had a people that have personal computers it would be much easier but um and then at the end of the year i i totaled up what we were spending say for groceries or or entertainment or things like that and then this year i tried to keep it within you know a bounds there and then if there's if we are over budget in one item if we want to apply that to another one i try to do that but it's not always uh-huh easy when you have extra expenses say the car repairs came up this month things like that that you're not expecting i don't really know how some people stay within a budget oh yeah i can i can understand that do you have kids got one kid one we don't have any because i thought if well if we had a child i don't know what we'd do but my husband gets paid once a week and i get paid every two weeks yeah and uh then every three months i have a bonus check and but then that's when we we try to put some a side at that time as far as savings uh i take out of each pay check i put so much into a four O one K pan in a profit sharing yeah and then he does the same thing he puts one into uh a stock plan at his company and also into a retirement plan yeah because to me that's the only way we're ever going save to be able to save oh yeah i because if the money comes in it's spent if it's not taken out before i get it yeah i understand that right right now that's just the problem i have and we don't ain't been able to save any because i am putting my wife through school right now oh yeah through nursing school so it's kind of got to that's very hard maxed out right now but um-hum we try to put a little away every every month you know and plus we've got child care which we got to put in there and everything and we try to put a little away for his you know school education and stuff for later on yeah they say how old is he he's five he's five they say by the time kids his age are ready to go to college it's gonna be about seventy thousand dollars a year for college yeah yep and it's just unbelievable well that's you know i i'm just twenty nine and when i went it was probably five hundred dollars a semester for the tuition books and everything yeah if you yeah it's kind of expensive for her you know going to nursing school nursing school is one of the more expensive ones um-hum where is she going uh U T A yeah uh i'm sure it is and you know the the uh budget part kind of falls in there you know you get unexpected expenses and stuff for that because she has to drive about twenty thirty minutes every day to school and that that adds more to the gas budget oh yeah is she started having do the uh working at the hospitals do what ma'am has she started doing any of work at the hospitals uh no she goes they have a class there every Tuesday and that's what they do and then she'll start during her senior year uh going to the hospital three times a week so yeah because i i've got a friend that just graduated and took her test to to be an R N and i i think towards the last year they were working at the hospitals and then they all had to buy all the uniforms and and all the things which was an added expense yeah but it is hard i don't know in in compared to say my mother and father living in a budget was no problem um-hum it was just this is what we have and this is what we spend but that's in this time and you know i don't know what it is it's well it's you know my husband let's go play some golf you know something like that or let let's run to the mall with me and and before you know parent's didn't do that if they didn't have the money they didn't get it and we're not that way yeah yeah i understand that's the same problem we fall into you know um-hum you know when we do have a little extra we try to go out and do a little something you know um-hum be with the kids a little bit during that time and and it's hard kind of a family deal and as far as like the you know with interest rates now as low as they are credit card rates are still sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen percent  well how do you feel about trial by jury i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently uh in what way in that it seems to me they're swayed more by emotion than uh by evidence that's presented i have uh very little regard for the law that's presently practiced i mean do you do you feel they're they're swayed more toward are you talking about with criminal or civil suits i was thinking primarily criminal cases um-hum so you think that i mean that the stereotypical bleeding heart juries where they feel sorry yes um-hum that's a concern of mine uh i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh you know doing the sentencing um-hum the other thing the other thing that really bothers me about that is i think you know that a judge can be uh i like the idea of juries of your peers um in that um-hum you you you you you get more first of all you get more than one person making the decision making a decision and second of all you get a wide variety of background so that yeah my question i guess is are they really your peers um-hum uh i'd agree that that's that's definitely a problem uh too often i think they're not and uh when you you when you are um-hum selecting a jury and you're doing it partially if if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have um-hum you know that's a matter of concern to me too uh i think that uh in such cases uh they're not really looking for unbiased people but rather for biased um-hum uh now i happen to know several judges and there's one that i'd feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury i'd feel a little bit uneasy about but the other two i feel uh would give either um-hum you know the the plaintiff or the defendant the the full benefit of the law um-hum and i guess that's what i am concerned with yeah i i guess i i definitely agree with you but sentencing the well what i don't like about uh sentencing juries doing the sentencing in that um-hum i think it becomes a lot less the the the the same crime gets unequal sentences this is very true i uh i i think there is more of an ability of you know you know selecting selecting selecting a jury two two different juries that would most of the time come up with the same idea the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty or innocent um-hum um-hum but i think i think that there'd that there'd be a large variation in in trying to gauge the the severity of the crime and an appropriate punishment and and have that that measure stick across the board yeah and you do see such uneven uneven sentencing uh you know evidence of it in the newspapers and such i mean um-hum um-hum where uh it would appear that the crimes were very similar but one individual got twenty five years and the other one was sentenced to life for something um-hum uh of course a lot of that's also the the ability of of the defendant to uh get a good lawyer isn't that the truth um-hum there are times when is it uh oh goodness my mind's gone blank it uh Othello you know where he says kill all the lawyers every now and then one is tempted to feel that way um-hum yeah i agree but i it's taken me a long time to understand that uh lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice as we think of um-hum you know amateur as novices tend to think that uh attorneys care about justice um-hum oh yeah i i agree with it yeah they and they'll admit to you that they cannot don't have the benefit of being able to you know of of of letting allowing themselves to believe their client client innocent or guilty it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury um-hum through argument that the and they're very effective too uh even i've been involved slightly slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty but uh his attorneys gotten him off um-hum um-hum um-hum uh the city has dropped their charges against him because their the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge so i don't know yeah uh yeah this is a little bit of the subject but one one thing that i that i really dislike uh also that's that's new is the uh is that i have heard that there are federal sentences  okay well how do you feel about uh drug testing uh for prospective employees well i i think my feelings on it are it depends i think if it's necessary if you have the kind of job that it it requires you to always be you know like police officers firemen doctors anybody who has you know who's important whose decisions are important and you know that's uh-huh that's what i think as far as you are required to not only be at work when you're not at work as it were you know what i'm saying if you if if oh i see oh twenty four hour people you mean yeah people who who could be at work at any time or whose decisions could be clouded if they had to make a decision uh-huh uh-huh when they aren't at work but i don't see the point in it if you're if you're putting something together down at the local pizza place or whatever um-hum then i'd uh i just don't see what merits you're going to have from gaining what you do when you're not at work in those situations is your own business i think i think that's an infringement upon your personal rights um-hum that's an invasion of your personal privacy that's if they were to decide that you shouldn't be drinking would would they just you know i mean you you have to draw the line somewhere i think and give people the right to do what they need to do what they want to do uh-huh would you uh would you do it before they were employed or would would you say random testing is also okay yes i okay i'm i'm i'm i i think that's fine i think if you're if if it matters to you that much then you should you know i mean if you want to weed out those kind of people right from the start i have no problem with that because you don't you don't want somebody who's a drug user starting work for you but i don't i don't think that they can just yeah come back and and get you anytime you know i i don't think it it could be surprise at your door here we are you know or um-hum yeah or come to show up for work one day and they just say here you go i i don't know it's kind of it's a hard problem isn't it because because you don't want an airline pilot on drugs yeah it's it's really you don't yeah exactly but at the same time that's a that's a that's an embarrassing humiliating kind of test to have to take people questioning you by you know by doing that yeah um-hum it's yeah it's kind of a do you trust me do you not trust me yeah you know it's i don't know i don't i don't know it's it's awfully it's it has it's points it's good points and it's bad points see it kind of makes us look like we're going in the other direction as far as the way the rest of the world's going almost yeah you know i've walls are coming come in Berlin and and we're and we're getting we and here we are we're going the other way and it does feel like it doesn't it yeah it does and so i don't know it's kind of a perplexing problem i know well it is because when we think about it and it isn't at all reassuring doctors have been on drugs for years from what i hear oh yeah yeah you know and and uh we've uh and we have all sorts of people who've done things and i'm certainly not in favor of of any of that and yet somehow they've performed and then they say well if i did what i was suppose to do and did it the way i was suppose to do it then why would you you know whose business is it yeah who am i harming as long as i am doing my job yeah right and yet the potential like i don't like knowing that there might be an alcoholic who is flying my plane or or you know cutting into my body yeah yeah exactly you don't want your doctor coming in hung over if he's gonna be cutting on you that day that's for sure so uh yeah that is difficult you're gonna you can't but then that just kind of comes back to personal responsibility uh-huh you but i guess that's more or less forcing you to be personally responsible for yourself it's basically all they're trying to do with that then if you want to if you look at it that way because you would think your doctor wouldn't be out drinking the night before but but if he thought he could get caught doing it then he certainly wouldn't do it as opposed to well that's right that's right it's not a big operation tomorrow what the heck or something you know it's only only only old lady so and so from where ever and yeah yeah it's just a gallbladder it ain't you know no problem yeah i guess that's just uh that's basically what they're doing then just forcing you to be responsible but i guess some people have to be forced so right yeah it and it does it does make you wonder because i'm not sure i was trying to think in in history have have people checked that or did people just did people just accept the responsibility or are we able to test things now that never could be tested before so therefore we're using technology in a way that wasn't available before that was yeah wasn't yeah that's i don't know i i kind of think well it's partially because we have the technology now but it's also because i think moral standards have gone downhill quite a bit since earlier you know i mean it's just it's just reached that point where society accepts um-hum um-hum you know you don't think about seeing your doctor out at a bar anymore whereas you know nineteen forty doctor so and so right  well just just as i answered the phone there was there was a voice that came on the line and said you were suppose to you talk about capital punishment how does the law what how do the laws in the different states compare and to be restricted to certain crimes or certain circumstances or something like that yeah uh-huh i honestly don't know what Illinois' position on capital punishment is do you know for Texas well i know we're kind of beefing it up now uh the past year or so the people that are on death row and have been for years and years and years they're beginning to go on and executed them now We have the uh lethal injections lethal injection uh-huh and uh it's going to take at least all ready this year three have been put to death and i think at this point i am for that as long as you know they've had all the chances they need to have on appeals and this i don't see why they should have to and why we should have to support them for twenty or thirty years on death row that once they have been sentenced by a jury of their peers found guilty and then gone through the appeal bit then why continue yeah i i i strongly i strongly agree i think uh well in general i think we have we have a fairly lax legal system as far as protecting the criminal that's right and uh and i can see the the necessity of it but uh i don't know if someone's guilty and there's there's no question if if if there's is no question about it a lot of times you sentence someone to prison and there and there the jury finds them guilt then not in everyone's mind it's not actually settled right i can agree with that That it's so i can i can see letting uh letting for example the judge make the call or or maybe an appeals court make the call and on this it was this not just beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond any doubt right and so under circumstances where it's you know where there is no question about it the person actually did kill somebody and in particularly particularly in some of the more brutal cases or prevalent where they've killed several people yes yeah i i totally agree i i think it's kind of appalling that some one can commit murder and they know that they probably won't die for it yes Well i know of uh at least two this year that have been put to death have uh i mean they have already they had admitted to it They i mean there was no question and yes they had been going on fifteen to twenty years there on death row is that right and oh wow uh i think probably Texas is the most lax state there is on this That it just oh wow We do everything else fast baby that's that's probably why this was picked as one of the topics because Texas Instruments is in Texas and so right it's in the news it's not really in the news much up here i guess it was the Dahlmer case uh-huh that that was in the news everywhere uh-huh now where was that at uh i think that was in Houston so that was in Texas too yes uh-huh that's what i thought i believe so and uh i know we're going through a case right now that uh where parent's starved a child to death and uh i've heard you know people wondering whether you know should these people get the death penalty or not uh i i guess i would feel strongly about that when it involves a child especially they they tied this child uh-huh the police found the child tied and starved and uh there's no doubt a case like that there's no doubt in my mind that these people ought to get the death penalty that uh they did it they did it knowingly i guess that would be that would be the issue and they just tie the child and and were they were they punishing the kid and they don't realize that he was going to die or oh they did yes uh-huh oh they the were just punishing They didn't think far enough ahead i don't guess that you know that he would actually die or that they would get caught They had two of them well see that's i think i would think that differently they had two of them uh-huh two children two children two children One did not die one didn't huh yeah in that case he i think he could argue that i don't know if the parents were really intending to kill the kids well could be that would that would seem that would seem like that would that would i would have a harder time saying the death penalty was in order for that well i don't think i would but uh well no i i certainly think punishment is in order but the death penalty because that's i am not sure that is homicide because they didn't i i it it certainly wasn't intentional homicide uh-huh Well you may have a point there i it's just that i guess they have gotten so much publicity here but and i have read so much about it and yeah that's just that is that is a tough one but other than that uh you know i just  okay so what do you think about uh uh health care for the elderly well i've got a mom who is uh eighty six years old this year and uh she she uh sometimes well she lived with us for a few years six actually six years and then she moved uh to live with my bother because she got tired of teenagers but uh in my house uh i think health care for the elderly is uh is uh its kind of a difficult i say difficult i mean there's as your body is running downhill they can spend an infinite amount to keep you alive right and on the other hand it's kind of nice uh if you're taking care of an elderly person to have somebody come along and pick up the the uh the tab the the one thing that that mom got into was that was pretty nice was an HMO they took all the money from from uh Medicare how should i say it uh this HMO thing said uh had an agreement with Medicare that said uh on the average you're gonna spend X amount of dollars per year so if you'll give us that money we promise to take care of of uh all the bills all the bills does that include um nursing home type care no this is just you know standard just strictly health care health care like you'd get from your employer right and uh so at one point uh and and that was pretty good for her because uh there was a set of things that she knew she was covered for and uh and right that's hundred percent coverage so it's that's good well it was close to a hundred percent there were things that they wouldn't cover but they like they bought her a uh hm a uh let's see they bought her a wheelchair and uh one one thing that was good about it was that it uh uh before that time she was always subject she she'd have these salesmen that would call and say hey if you'll just buy this handy dandy motorized uh easy chair for three times the the real price uh Medicare will pay for it and so she was always buying stuff that she didn't need um and then finding out that Medicare was either going to pay just a small fraction or no Medicare wouldn't pay for it hm so it kind of put the uh salesmen at bay put it that way right so where does does she well um so how about you i guess in terms of where do you is your mother now in a a nursing home is no she's still she's staying with my uh actually she's staying with my my brother's son who's doesn't have teenagers right i guess that's the big question is um what what happens when they begin to get older i have a grandmother and it she's not really uh you know she's getting to the point where she almost can't be in a nursing home she spent some time with my parents some time now she's with an uncle of mine living with them yeah but she requires a lot of attention and she can't really exist on her own any longer and that's that's kind of a difficult situation that that she has to live with one of her children yeah it was difficult for us to because uh well actually it it was all right as long as she could could get back and forth to the uh you know to the bathroom and things like that but when she got when she got really sick and she couldn't move very much then it was exhausting absolutely exhausting right yeah you know so yeah my uh my grandmother is hers is physically she's in not too bad of shape she's in her upper eighties i guess forgetting in my order but uh she's uh Alzheimer's i guess oh yeah and so her memory is very poor and so she can't really be on her own but she can still do things by herself but you just have to uh kind of direct her yeah uh and that to that extent i think like i say this health care for the elderly is is uh i i think they do a lot there was one thing that that uh that helped pull my mom out of uh this oh i don't wanna know fog so to speak uh we had uh a a baby fairly late in life and uh as soon as that baby came along uh uh she paid a lot of attention to you know something to take care of i'll put it that way and something to pay attention to and and uh um-hum the other thing i've noticed is that that uh pets and and uh if they have pets to take care of uh like she got yeah she got uh that's true  so uh do do you know what the laws of Texas are in regard to capital punishment um i have to plead ignorant i really don't know i i think that that uh i think Texas is for it i don't think we've had any instances of it i'm sorry would you repeat that please pardon i'm sorry you you're just a little just a little quiet i just couldn't quite hear what you said oh okay sorry i said Texas is is for capital punishment um-hum i don't think we've had a case uh recently but but it is uh-huh uh-huh yeah and he i i'm uh i believe in California it is permitted but for a few years they were not doing it i don't think i don't think there's been an execution for a while uh but i'm a little ignorant of it myself i know that there was a um-hum there was a state supreme court justice who was uh being pounded on in the newspapers because she was overturning um-hum uh convictions or she was somehow keeping death penalties from being carried out and uh the newspapers were um-hum giving her a very hard time on that although i always suspected it was something else and that was just something to bang on her about yeah could be could be how do you feel about about the capital punishment well i i don't to me it seems unnecessary um i think that the sort of person who would be deterred by capital punishment would also be deterred by life in prison um and uh it seems just with the possibility of making mistakes that uh i would rather opt for life in prison where at least there's a chance the person could uh either change or perhaps even you know contribute to society from prison in some way um-hum well what do you feeling well uh i probably tend to fall come down on the side of of being for it but i i think it um-hum it it shouldn't be um there should be more safe guards to be sure that that you're you know no mistakes have been made but then i i tend to i tend to come down on the side that if if the laws were were enforced that were on the books you probably wouldn't need it right it's uh do you think it would be a deterrent well obviously that person wouldn't do it again well that is true that is true um and it but but i think that like i said if if the laws that are already on on the books that exist were enforced to the letter of the law uh-huh then i think that in itself would cut down on all kinds of crime oh i see you're thinking that if the laws were enforced in general people would be maybe people would be stopped at doing something before they got to the point of um-hum of killing somebody right because i i think too many too many of them walk you know um well you know i mean i think i think i'm in agreement with you on this point that hey there's a problem and the solution to the problem isn't whether you kill people or not at the end it's what happens before that uh and i would say that uh um-hum you know putting more giving more attention to uh child rearing you know as early as that is is it the terms of giving kids a good education and uh sort of a good uh i don't know moral or self esteem sort of backing that would keep them from getting into that sort of life in the first place could make it less necessary also well that's true you've got to have the foundation there yeah and that's i it seems like people uh focus more on the one end of the system where you're executing someone or not rather than the other end of the system where you're turning out a person who's likely to do something like that or not uh so i think that sort of goes along with what you're saying uh are there certain you know i mean are there certain crimes or do you think there are or should be certain crimes that are liable for it and others not i mean clearly there are but which ones do you think should be liable um well i think murder is number one um-hum uh i i i i tend to believe in an eye for an eye if you if you take a life then you need to lose yours you know not not that you can bring the other person back and and obviously can't um-hum um-hum um-hum but i see no reason to for you to continue you know and and possibly get out and do it again you know there's too much of um-hum if you could put them away and be assured that they would stay there you know where they couldn't hurt anybody else that'd be one thing but um-hum um-hum most of of the uh murderers that go to jail get  i'm an avid recycler um but our city's not doing as much as they ought to what about you all there there is a group in town called Nacogdoches Recycles that will meet i believe it's once a month at the park and you can take plastics papers uh-huh or bottles uh-huh but it's up to you to collect them it's up to you to get them down there and then what they do with them i don't know you don't know yeah there isn't any you somebody had had talked once before to City Council meeting about maybe having different colored waste cans right that they pick up uh-huh because they do that in Palestine and nobody wanted to go for that they were gonna charge a little extra on the bill and nobody wanted to do that um-hum um-hum uh-huh right nobody wanted to do it and i save aluminum cans and to take those to the to the closest place is about it do you have a place to take them it's about thirty minutes away wow is that right yeah and it and the last time we took some things the price is not really worth it worth it yeah not worth the gas huh yeah yeah yeah because by the time and you save them and squish them and right they're just they were everywhere yeah oh i know i know it and that's the bad thing about it and newspapers we we started saving newspapers and stuff well they just packed up and i have cats well they had a field day destroyed those now what do they do i have cats too but they don't do anything with newspaper mine have some kind of paper thing oh yes any any kind of cardboard and paper and they just tear it up oh really do with their claws or chew it um-hum both how fascinating i don't know what it is oh isn't that interesting i've got three cats but newspapers don't seem to interest them at all i don't know what it is and you can't leave the mail don't i don't leave the mail on on the coffee table or it's chewed up oh no is that right oh my gosh and it was just really one i've got i've got several and one in particular but then she kind of showed the other ones what was going on and then they learned how huh uh-huh so now it's just a big play play time well that's funny well i i we we do have more facilities than that around here so that we they're they are trying in Dallas to do some uh curbside recycling they've got special special you they selected sites and in those sites they they've been doing it and they've had a pretty good success so they're talking about you know doing it more but it isn't in my area so i've got a kitchen full of you know cans and bottles and scrap metal and everything and and then i have to drive it somewhere and there yeah i think if they would make it a little more convenient for us everybody would then everybody would do it well it's one of those things that makes you feel good you know makes you feel like you're part of of a of a solution to a problem that's true and and uh there's not that much that makes you feel like you've got any control over anything so oh i know and we take the little plastic bags back to the to the grocery store back to the grocery so your grocery store does that uh-huh yeah well that's good uh-huh but but as far as bottles and things go there isn't any place any any close and that's strange because now bottles are the one thing that are totally recyclable they're the easiest and and uh you know i mean i try to keep and reuse and i yeah yeah oh i even carry around uh you know like if i i i travel around the city a lot so that i'm frequently stopping at fast food place and eating in the car or on the way to the next site um-hum and i've gotten to saving the plastic forks and washing them and using them again so i don't keep doing that but boy i mean it's an exhausting way to live it really is we are very use to throwing things out there's no question about it and yeah i i've started saving like you said the plastic knives and forks and things uh-huh and i save all the little condiments and things and i yeah right exactly exactly lots of little uh soya sauces and ketchups all over the place yeah things that i normally threw out because they just give you ton and now i've got a big basket full in the refrigerator yeah that's right that's right well now i've gotten to where i say don't put any of that in because it just leaves me with having to dispose of it exactly they'll say do you want any no i do not no please no but i i try and we have a lot of of newspapers and magazines and things like that but yeah that's and that's hard to get rid of unless you've got there's one place here in town that will take the slicks and all your junk mail and cereal boxes and everything but you have to drive it downtown and so you know my kitchen i mean certainly i don't like anyone to ever come in because i've just got this stuff everywhere i don't drive it every day so i've got just piles of it yeah and i've got a tiny little kitchen so the option of you know some people will maybe have four bins one for your garbage and then i have no room right but but you have to move out of your house to have all that yeah yeah i have i have room enough for one garbage can and that it is yeah yeah i know and it and it really is hard and and uh i then i'll fill up the back of my car and i'm driving around with trash in my car and that well at least maybe it keeps someone from stealing yeah you know because they'll think there's nothing in this car but trash anyway and that's true  well i definitely think taxes are too high uh taxes at all levels uh state local and federal are over fifty percent of many people's uh income now and uh the amazing thing is to think that one of the primary reasons for the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution was exorbitant taxes but for them exorbitant taxes were under ten percent it was ridiculous you know uh that that uh we we took such drastic action over taxes uh and it's so much worse now but people are just apathetic about it and sit back and do nothing well let's see uh yeah i think taxes are high but uh yeah maybe in some cases they're not high enough for instance uh here in my state uh you have a real high sales tax there if i recall yeah we do yeah but the but the reason the sales tax is high is because we don't have an income tax uh-huh and uh you know we don't have an income tax because uh basically nobody nobody wants any new taxes but the upshot is that we can't properly fund uh education here oh really yeah so like the amount that we spend on education here in uh in the state of Washington per uh per student get out of my room is is actually in the in the lower percentile uh i mean is is is low it we're we're ranked fairly low interesting uh per fifty states yet uh you know yet we expect a lot out of the schools you know we've got here in the Seattle area we've got a lot of uh uh high technology industries we've got Microsoft here well Microsoft expects well educated employees sure but uh you know Microsoft is only paying property taxes towards uh towards uh towards schools so and there are those that argue well they waste too much money in schools or those or there there's you know more money doesn't solve the problem but i feel like in public schools that they uh uh that they really don't fund it they they don't basically fund it very well my my feeling about at least i I don't know if we want to get off the subject of taxes and on to the subject of schools but around here uh some of the public schools get more funds than the private schools uh in terms of you know the per student expenditure at say Carver High School in Atlanta is over eleven thousand dollars per student but the best private school is uh has a tuition of only seven thousand and all of their students of course rank consistently in the top ten percent on the SAT etcetera and the the public school that gets uh quite a bit more money just doesn't uh doesn't turn out that quality of student and well it's cheaper to to educate uh people who are in the top ten percent than it is to have to educate the handicapped and the developmentally disabled and all that stuff yeah but i think a lot of it is just that uh the money is wasted on bureaucracy and it's not very efficient um uh we we have you know a state department of education and things which all all they do is do statistics and push paper around and none of the uh one of the things that's happened here is that uh the percentage of the money going to instruction meaning teacher's salaries and books and materials has been falling even though that the uh total funding has been going up uh so that uh you know whereas twenty years ago seventy percent of the money going to schools went to teacher's salaries and books and materials now it's only forty five percent and that's really scary to think that uh yeah that's i've i've been hearing that that's uh that that's been going down and uh i don't know what uh what all the reasons are for that yeah i think that uh one of the reasons our taxes are so high is just that uh on on top of the inefficiencies like what i just described is the government tries to do too many things that the government has no business doing you know we're spending a couple a hundred billion dollars a year to maintain troops in Europe and Asia uh we have no business spending that money and uh we're spending over two hundred billion dollars a year on interest on the debt uh there was a Presidential candidate forum here last Saturday and just we just had our primary in Georgia and uh uh you know i I one of the questions i asked the representative of Bob Carey who was there was uh and we have a projected four hundred billion dollar budget deficit this year what are you gonna do to to correct that and all he talked and and all they could say all the is the only thing he would do is consolidate some cabinet  well Jackie uh on taxes i i'd guess i'd have to say that i my opinion is that i'd do think that Americans are paying too much in taxes uh what's your feeling about that i agree i think taxes are high right uh where you live do you you have a state income tax and a sales tax both um yes uh-huh uh uh-huh yeah in New Hampshire we have uh uh no no what we call broad base taxes no income tax and no sales tax oh uh we tax business uh eight percent businesses are taxed eight percent and we have uh what we call the five B's uh for our taxes booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets uh gambling uh-huh oh so uh we do have a very low tax rate but you know combined with the federal income tax i think that Americans uh generally do pay in too too much in taxes right yeah i agree i agree i think this is about time of the year where you you just start getting um well if you do get money back from like jobs like i'm still a student so um i only work part time so i i get a check back uh-huh well that's nice from from taxes but nice to nice to get a refund yeah it is but it's not much uh-huh do you think that uh for whatever taxes we do pay that uh we're getting value for it so no yeah uh my my opinion of taxes is that when you send money to Washington or to the state and they say they're going to send some back it's like giving yourself a transfusion it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion yeah you know what i mean yeah uh it it really uh i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because yeah there you go right because uh yeah there's an old saying in in amongst taxes and politicians that uh there's a fly paper effect and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol uh a lot of it stays there and uh not that much comes back to you right yeah i don't know i don't doesn't seem like they're doing much with it neither i mean there's plans there and now with the voting and and people you know getting into senate and government and stuff i mean they have nice plans and um-hum um but they don't always work and then you know they try to raise taxes more and i don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work you know and the taxes get raised i don't know i'm not you know really into politics i don't really understand it but that's it um-hum it's just you know well it does it it it it does seem that uh the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend uh it's almost like they'll spend as much as the they were were they're allowed to collect you know right um i there's an interesting proposal that's been uh going around now for a few years of having a flat tax uh ten percent or thirteen percent there would be no figuring i mean you would take your income tax you'd have a certain amount i mean you you take your total salary um-hum uh those who made under a certain amount wouldn't have owe any taxes and then there'd be a set amount for however many people you know dependents you had hm and you would just pay a flat tax no exemptions no deductions or anything else after you you know after you uh figure out you know who's in your family right huh and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the IRS and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with you know yeah that could be nice yeah huh i i'd like to see something like that yeah i think it would be fairer and uh it would put a lot you know a lot of the tax attorneys out of business and i'm sure they'll fight it tooth and nail but i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans right i mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty five or thirty thousand dollars pays four five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes uh two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes yeah right hm doesn't seem fair to me yeah it isn't there's not much out there that's fair that's for sure right huh i'll agree to that right i think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high i i if i'm not mistaken aren't they i mean for your state what is do you know what your state income tax rate is um um no i i have no idea i just twenty percent my dad does it all for me just you just pay it huh i use you're like you're like my daughter who's in in college down in Massachusetts and uh she works as a waitress and she's attending college full time also and she sends her taxes to me and i figure them out she really has no idea she gets a refund check and um-hum yeah  okay how do you keep up with current events um well actually usually um in the mornings i am getting ready to either go to work um usually catch the news in the morning yeah what what channel do you watch or what station uh NBC that's the one i watch i usually keep up with TV i don't i am a student so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff um-hum so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't yeah too great sometimes yeah i usually tend to just you know rely on you know TV um again you know just through the grapevine just just to know like yeah what what today's stories are and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one yeah the radio doesn't really have much news sometimes the stations i listen to are just mainly music yeah i think you you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all yeah do you think that TV is um pretty accurate i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized or well what i really don't like about TV especially local news as compared to like national news is just um it seems it seems like everything is very spoon feed and you know it's it's more like the news shows is now is is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom yeah or like the news because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports you know is is you're kids bus driver smoking crack on the way to school you know yeah it's they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news um-hum yeah also also i have the observation with um with the press is that like any any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life huh you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had had more than just a blurb about it that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story it's something wrong yeah going they're looks like they're going more for ratings than for um-hum you know actual news i think you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers um-hum they typically have a better i am from a small town too here in Texas um-hum and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato and yeah the farm report yeah farm report and oil reports that's pretty pretty sad or who killed who um-hum yeah also i have um founded like in newspapers probably aren't as bad as television but i just you know read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down and yeah well in um in Dallas um i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's and the story was uh was that like he started shooting people people in this cafeteria or something yeah and the news covered it um-hum right you know hours after it happened and they were taping people who were crying who um-hum had everything and then like three days later this local news station was using as a as their promo um-hum to promote themselves i just thought that was really oh yeah i have seen that happen lots of times you know that's kind of cold you know Channel X gives you the best coverage you know we were on the scene with our team players you know yeah and it was just they were showing like these dead people and they were showing people crying i mean just taking advantage of you know um-hum uh-huh uh-huh it real personal moment they are trying to get the you know most emotional response for yeah it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story but just the play on people's emotions it's just gotten so i mean somewhere there's it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite days you know yeah and everything yeah i have you know i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know yeah um you know even the national news i just find it to be you know yeah very watered down very yeah what did you think of the coverage of the war um i found i found it very one sided did you um you know i mean it just it just seemed to lack any sort of debate yeah um you know you know not saying that we should that we that we definitely should have been there or shouldn't have been there but it just seemed like you know they kept just showing you know how great we were doing and it never really showed what actually um-hum the damage that really happened that's um-hum a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the you know the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties and they kind of you know um-hum if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know um-hum got really hurt and everything and yeah and i really think that you know in the in the involvement that the press states you know that the the military basically sets the press  okay i guess we're recording now so yeah i think they could uh uh our neighborhood they have a recycling program and you've got to pay for them to pick it up and stuff yeah and then they get paid for recycling it so i don't know if that's very fair or not well Dallas is talking about starting something like that too it's going to be i i don't know if it's three dollars a week i think it's three dollars a month is what we are going to have to pay um uh we do recycle an awful lot of stuff here i i up until a couple of years ago i use to get paid oh maybe not a lot but i use to be able to find a place that i could get you know a penny a pound for glass and a couple of pennies a pound for plastic and yeah something for the newspapers and something for the aluminum cans and nowadays it's like i i can't find one place that's going to take everything yeah well that's and i am trying to recycle my kitchen my kitchen waste by building a compost pile and that's not easy either i wish i could figure out an easier way that's for sure of doing that but uh uh well we we use to save all our newspapers and plastic and stuff like that and then take it to Wal-Mart because they use to have a recycling bin yeah and but they got rid of them because there's a lot of people were throwing their trash and stuff in there so and they just got rid of them well Kroger's uh at least in Dallas Kroger's will pay for aluminum and will collect the glass and the plastic yeah but they don't collect newspaper and they don't collect tin cans and they don't collect cardboard and i know that the place at Galleria there is one bin in their loading dock area that's for cardboard only and they will recycle the cardboard from there yeah so every once and a while after multiple birthdays and i have all these you know cardboard packaging stuff left over then i go and i recycle that over there but it's you know i have to run around town to get my stuff recycled yeah that i always say they should have just one central place you know where you can just dump them all yeah uh or in you know cause really i am not really looking for the the money portion of it you know i just well i use to it use to be a good deal us to give instead of giving my kids an allowance i just told them they could go around the neighborhood and collect things to be recycled and then i would drive them over and they get some money and it was a good way to teach them that their work earned them oh yeah some money and at the same time it was cleaning up the neighborhood and it was getting stuff recycled and yeah i've heard but know it's just you know i can't do that because they don't earn any money for it and i hate to see that happen but yeah you know and i would also i'd like to see the state you know they say on all sorts of things you know the they the diaper people advertise that diaper are recyclable and they are working on a program to recycle and well yeah in one small community they're recyclable but there is nothing around that will recycle that or recycle tires or recycle you know uh you know uh they say all these plastics are recyclable but nobody will take anything on beyond a two and so all the bags and all the stuff that's four or six doesn't get recycled yeah yeah and uh and you know and if it's recyclable why can't they just throw it in with the rest of the plastic and stuff you know it's just well or if it has to be separated by number why doesn't someone take it i mean i can't find it's i can't even find somewhere that will take the stuff yeah yeah that's yeah and i i think maybe one thing that we could do to encourage it would be to require uh you know government agencies and stuff were required to use only recycled paper for instance yeah and to define recycle paper as paper that includes you know material that had actually been used as paper before yeah one of the things that they do is that they call stuff recycled paper like when they when they make envelopes and stuff they had what they call mill ends yeah you know the little the pieces from that they cut out from making the envelopes yeah well that's what they are recycling cause that never had any ink on it that's what we usually send them to recycle it never had any ink on it they don't have to clean it they put that in with with fresh wood fiber yeah and they call that recycled paper um you know well then nobody wants to buy my newspaper and nobody wants to to figure out how to you know how to clean up  Dave what kind of pets do you have oh we have one rotten cat one rotten cat yeah it's my son's cat i heard a laugh in the background yeah that's the boys they they know i don't like it oh you don't like cats well i like cats this cat is a uh more like a dog oh yeah yeah he's uh a a one owner he likes one boy in the family and that's about it that said what does how does he treat the other people just uh stays away or runs wow usually but he follows he'll follow my oldest son around you know when he's in the house he'll come up and he'll jump on his lap but if anybody reaches over to pet him or whatever he'll just kind of look at them like what are you doing did he raise him or something and he he's yeah we bought the cat for him and so he's he's been the one that you know spent the most time with him but i i've never owned a cat like that i've had cats growing up all the time and you know they're usually either that way with everybody or friendly to everybody uh-huh huh that's interesting so it's a weird cat huh we have a a mutt well we we named it Hooper because that's where we got it from uh some lady a mutt uh-huh she uh a lot of people uh uh drop off abandoned abandoned pets at her house oh and she used to work for a veterinarian veterinarian so she would spay uh neuter them um-hum give them all their shots and we saw an ad saying it was free so we went down there and picked it up and it's been an excellent dog but this is my first dog i've i've had and we got it because well my wife stays here at home alone while i go to work so that's mostly why we got it to keep her company while i'm away at work uh-huh so that is that kind of your child right now um yeah right now it it is it's kind of good training i mean we've been trying for kids but right now we haven't had any but you feel like oh uh-huh it's pretty good training i think i mean it it keeps us on our toes have have you had dogs before uh my brother has um we didn't do a lot with them um i never felt it like it was mine or anything you couldn't do anything uh-huh but i mean it's a bit more responsibility when it's yours and not your brother's yeah well i just um we've you know when i was growing up i had we always had a dog but and we had mostly well not not mutts but mixes you know like one or one or two mix um-hum and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs that's what we found ours is uh like a Cockapoo i think it's half Cocker Spaniel and half Poodle but it's a really good dog uh-huh uh-huh yeah i don't know they seem to be i mean listen better or something is your cat a purebred um-hum no no it's just uh an accident from a friend from uh my son's friend down the street their their cat uh-huh was an outside cat and just end up with some kittens and would you ever want a dog in the family um we i would we um we had a dog that was a um mix between a an Alaskan Malamute and a Labrador um-hum and i should say a pup and he was just too big for our kids when we got him and we oh yeah when we moved into our house that was the first thing we wanted to get was uh you know was a pet and and it was a dog that we gotten he was just he was just too big um the kids couldn't handle him and i was still going to school um-hum and my wife was working and i was working and so we just didn't have time to really train him so he was kind of just there you know he's too big for the kids to handle so he was just tied up to a post oh yeah so we gave him to uh i don't know if you've there's a place out here on it's called Shorties Lane out here in Harrisville and they have um um-hum i guess it's kind of an animal shelter but he just takes a few of the animals in and some he destroys and some he keeps um-hum so we took him up there and he ended up keeping him um because he's had him for six or seven years we we've saw him just a oh i guess about a year ago and uh i thought boy that sure looks like that pup we gave away and so we asked him about it one day and he said yeah he's been the best dog i've ever had in my life um-hum wow just goes everywhere with him i he would've been a great great dog they just need a lot of time  this recycling it's uh i don't know what you all are doing but we are not doing a whole lot here in Arlington about it uh they have a trial section that uh so part of the city has been given these uh plastic garbage cans where you are suppose to separate and put it out right i don't happen to be in the part of the city that does that though right here in Philadelphia the city for residential customers has certain they had a trial section that was having curb side recycling with special containers uh-huh and then they decided to go ahead and phase it in piece by piece so every year a different piece of the city gets added to the list but in my neighborhood they have had voluntary recycling for several years now uh-huh you on the first and third Saturdays of every month you take your bottles and your newspapers and lets see bottles newspapers to certain corners in the neighborhood uh-huh and there is a farmer's market that collects the plastic they uh yes it use to be a firehouse uh-huh but they are trying to get some urban renewal going in here and trying to make the area safer i live near the University of Pennsylvania where i'm a grad student uh-huh and it's not the safest neighborhood there is so they are trying to get urban renewal going and they one of the things that this farmer's market does is collect plastic uh-huh and they use that money to keep up the building and organize events and that kind of thing oh that's interesting the grocery stores here usually have some bins for the plastic bag recycling and some of the plastic jugs and bottle type things right they have that for the plastic bags here too yeah let's see and the uh-huh um we don't have very uh i do not know of a very good place for glass here but i don't i would not know where to take glass uh-huh how about aluminum cans do they recycle that oh yes they'll recycle those we have places for those and uh for a while they were the newspapers there were places but i think they had so many newspapers now they are kind of discouraging us from taking them any place right well the only part the thing is that it's probably isn't profitable to just from a standpoint of making new paper to recycle um-hum but where you end up having a savings is at your landfill last so much longer yes i know and we have that problem but uh down home i know my folks um live in South Carolina and they have had some landfill filling up problems and they the county built a new landfill and a site that wasn't geologically proper uh-huh so that the landfill consideration is a good reason that probably communities are still going to end up paying to have the paper taken away but they just won't have to build landfills as often i see another things that they are doing now at home but in the offices here is recycling of paper and and that is done by separating the white paper which is i guess is a higher quality uh-huh from the miscellaneous paper hum and well they also recycle aluminum cans yes they have every office has two little cardboard boxes for putting in the white paper and the mixed paper oh that's a good idea and big trash cans down at the ends of the hallways that when they get filled up you can go take them down the hall oh but do you all have any place around there for uh used oil car oil oh you know that's one thing that kind of bothered me i now when i i use to get my my oil changed when i go down to South Carolina there has been a Goodyear tire store that has been servicing my car for a number of years uh-huh uh-huh and they have pretty economical rates but now in South Carolina there is this mandatory waste recycling fee and my daddy would like to to get the used oil to pour over fence posts huh so you know to make the fence posts last longer and weather better but the oil the the uh Goodyear store won't even right uh-huh uh-huh they say they can't give you the oil they say it's against the federal law now and that they have to charge the waste recycling fee my goodness so the only way you can get in South Carolina anyway and they say it's because of federal law you can get your used oil back is to do it yourself huh well we do ours ourself and we take it to a uh  how do you feel about gun control well uh i mean i don't think that guns should be outlawed um but it's going to a lot of the stuff that i mean all you do is to get guns uh-huh and then like with the stuff of that massacre in Killeen Texas not too long ago uh-huh but i don't really know i mean unless they do uh just outlaw them how you can uh i mean prevent that well don't you think that you know just having you know some you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with with you know you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry yeah that well do you even know what the procedures are now i mean it varies from State to State um there is no national but it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun especially if you have the money to pay for it uh in most States as long as you aren't a convicted felon yeah you know or on probation or you know other obvious things like that uh and i know i know that like in a lot of states you could you could be just like released from a mental hospital the day before you know be be obviously insane and then you you know but have your legal right to get a gun huh i didn't know that well that's pretty scary so does now do they want us to say where we feel about it like in rating it one to ten uh uh yes i'd probably i'd probably say about a five that's where i would probably be seems like it's a good safe number to pick you know well i mean i mean i don't really know what they can how they can really enforce the laws any better uh-huh because i mean i do think that some people need them and like for protection and stuff and i can understand them wanting to have them but then again it's just like all those nuts out there uh-huh uh-huh well you know uh uh other than that if you are looking at like you know country that you know uh where they do have a lot more gun control like England and places like that you know the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much it has because well i mean yeah the uh the in comparing per capita murders are incredibly lower than the United States hum uh you know i mean the problem though is you know they if the since the United States had this you know pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that i think you know if you were introduced you know any controls it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already yeah you know so it's so it's really into a kind of a complex problem well is the crime that bad there in Atlanta uh i'm not really sure how bad it is i've i've not really had that many problems with it but i mean apparently we we were ranked pretty high up yeah i know Dallas is uh i mean i think you know in the i mean i i think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years i don't know if Dallas is in the top three but oh do you own a gun uh-huh no i've i've thought about getting one if i get one i think i will probably you know get something i probably wouldn't get a hand gun i would probably get like a shotgun just for protecting myself you know from you know burglar type thing i do kind of live in the downtown area uh-huh yeah you know and shotguns are really good because you know they're i mean somebody is not going to break in steal it and you know use it to mug someone you know that's true uh and you know you yeah i just don't i just don't understand these people you know that like when they they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know they are probably going to miss the person and they're going shoot and they're going to shoot through five wall and hit someone you know i mean a shotgun just just struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of you know whoever yeah you pretty much you pretty much stop them and you don't then the actual shot doesn't go that far you know a wall will stop it pretty much well well now when i first moved to Dallas i moved up here by myself and uh my dad gave me a gun uh-huh but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it uh-huh so i finally ended up giving it back to him i said i don't want it i don't want to be responsible for it because uh-huh you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn i don't need it uh-huh yeah that that really does scare me people you know that have guns because you know if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot but you pick up the gun and point it at the person that that person rushes you and they get it from you uh-huh and you know you're pretty much dead you know because you you've just told the person that you you're about to kill them then set them off you know and and well i mean you you you you basically made it clear to the person that you know unless he unless you know that you are a real danger to them and then you know if you if they manage to get the gun from you you know their first reaction is going to be you know stop you yeah well that's why i ended up giving it back to him i thought well you know uh-huh i don't want it if i don't know how to operate you know if i don't really know how to use it and i just didn't want the responsibility uh-huh um so well well uh did you hear about that Killeen massacre or whatever yeah the did it happen at a cafeteria or something yeah right that kind of uh-huh i mean it just makes you wonder how people get guns i would be scared selling guns to people  what do you do there in Lubbock as far as uh recycling is concerned well you know they actually started and i assumed it was TI wide um uh they they've started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper uh-huh uh i've you know either computer paper or different types of paper i've had some ideas on how i think they could probably do it a little um um-hum less expensively and accomplish the same purpose but i i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in oh yeah what what would be more efficient about it what what um well the way they have you know they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module or down the hall or a lot of people aren't going to get up walk out of their offices and go there uh-huh uh-huh you know where i used to work we had what we called tree boxes that's just what we called them uh-huh and they were recycled cardboard they were eight and a half by eleven and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there and when it filled up you called you know facilities whoever to come pick it up and they brought you another box so not only is it you know i think more people would take advantage of it and use it uh i think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we're paying for them to to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step oh kind of type thing so i see yeah i i i i uh i was gonna say because i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for it says paper on it you know and uh if right but if i have a if i i printed up something that i don't need it just chunk it in the in the paper right but somebody still has to collect all that and bundle it together and whereas if you had a box that was preset and it got full you closed the box it's already bundled it's already done for you that's true hm certainly that's a good idea so you're saving a lot of time and effort i just need to put it on paper and yeah i guess recommended it to somebody and see if they think it's feasible uh-huh so um what else do they do in the Dallas area well um as far as TI's concerned i'm not sure um and uh i've heard uh you know uh in residential situations i live in a dorm and i've heard in residential situations uh like in Plano uh-huh um that they are doing uh stuff like having recycle picked up hm where uh the city uh i guess the sanitation department uh as part of their responsibility picks up uh the recycled items as well you know the plastics and the paper uh and uh aluminum and um the only responsibility of the of the patron is to separate them and then the the uh i guess the department takes them and and does what they do with them and it doesn't cost the patron anything doesn't really cost the uh department anything extra right they don't pay they don't pay for the recycled items that sounds good there's i i've been wanting to put like two of three bins like right out my garage door where you know from the kitchen where you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other or the uh even uh there are areas that can recycle the the tin cans like your you know vegetable things come in and um um-hum so i i've not done that but that's kind of what i wanna set up so because we do go through aluminum cans you know that's probably the one we use most um-hum uh but well what what what kind of uh services do you have there in Lubbock as far as uh where can you take your recycle items i i lived in Abilene for a uh i went to school there at Abilene Christian and i it was so hard to uh find a place you know if you if you wanted to recycle your newspapers it was impossible well um uh they they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers aluminum cans those are the two major items now we can take oil like car oil recycled oil to they have uh dump areas like at the fire departments throughout town hm um-hum um i don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans uh i think they can do the plastics like the liter bottles things like that um-hum um-hum um-hum um but i i don't know i know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments um-hum so well that's good i do that i think people are becoming more aware yeah you know of of the waste and you know i i like to see you know you you drive through Burger King now and the bags are recycled paper and you know so you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it uh-huh you know like maybe it's making an impact do you tend to buy more recycled items that if if something uh in the pack says recycled and something else doesn't do would you tend to chose the one that does or i'm not as good about searching something out like that but if i'm there and the choice is there i would probably take the recycled product um-hum hm um-hum so you know that's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible as a citizen wise you know looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way sure yeah so um you know they're getting away from the styrofoam  okay so Frank what uh type of uh budget do you or your family have well uh i don't know that we really have a budget i have a set amount that i that i save actually well actually there is a a way uh we budget our our money apparently uh my wife uh has so much uh you know gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks and uh we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff gas and things like that and besides that i uh you know i have a set amount that i save every every month right that's that's sounds like uh probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have i'm single so i guess uh-huh uh-huh uh i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically really don't need to right i don't need to i'm the only that i have to keep track of so it makes it a little bit easier uh that's right um and also i you know i try to save a certain amount each month as well and uh um-hum i kind of i kind of have an idea of what my expenses are and i i'm pretty consistent from month to month uh-huh and uh whenever i need to uh you know whenever that changes i'm pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it right well i found that uh you know things as as i've gotten older i'm in my fifties now but before we use to have to have to very have a very strict budget i had four kids and uh you know we we planned out how much we're going to spend for food and how much for for this and for that and kind of anticipate how much things were going to be and uh i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that i set aside uh like i kind of fence off areas of my check book for instance there are certain things that i know will come up uh every so often every six months i have to pay car insurance uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but um-hum what i do on my money market account for my taxes for instance which amount to uh an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month i'll just take two hundred and twenty out and i put it in parenthesis i take it out of the right line total um-hum and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it and then when the tax bill comes in i've got that much set aside right and i guess that's a way of budgeting yeah that's i guess i kind of do a similar thing more medium uh medium or longer range i just have a maybe a target amount that i'll save for like i'm probably within a year i'd like to buy a new car um-hum so i kind of have uh an amount in my mind and i'm making every effort to to put a little bit away and you know increase the amount i need for a down payment or whatever uh-huh yeah uh cars are are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget not only for buying them but for for keeping them on the road too right um you know we've got two cars my wife has a car and i and i like to drive a pick up truck so we're on a schedule where i try every uh three or four years to to buy a new one and you know i'm constantly making car payments but i figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway is making car payments um-hum so uh you know i get one paid for and uh actually i'm saving up for another one besides so hm it's you you know it's it's kind of a never ending thing but you try to you try to schedule those things so that right uh you're only you're not paying for two at the same time i guess what i'm saying right have you thought about uh leasing well i've thought about it but leasing wouldn't i you know i don't use it for my business my wife uses hers just for pleasure and i use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away so i see right but if you're rolling it over every three years it might be advantageous to do that yeah i guess uh you know typically you if you purchase your own car you tend to make uh the best returns after you pay it off of course you know the longer you keep it beyond that point the more profitable it is to own it yourself uh-huh right yeah you're right um i i have uh been know to keep trucks or cars for oh ten or twelve years but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill and you got to put put stuff into them you know that's right yeah mine's uh seven years old and i think last year was that was a rough year for it i had expenses a number of expenses uh-huh but uh i'm hoping that most most of them were just kind of uh you know the as you get to a certain number of miles you have to get everything replaced brake shocks and all that so i just went through that whole set last year um-hum and i'm hoping i'll be have a slow period before i need that again those things can really upset your budget when they when they come in uh you know it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the for the unexpected shall we say right so that it doesn't uh kill you all in one month right what line of work are you in  okay what's your view all right huh what's your view well i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns yeah personally yeah that's true i mean you know even if they give it a shot it's still going to be black market all over the place you know that's right that's right i don't know coming from Texas you're probably i don't know i i shouldn't make stereo types but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think yeah it is but i'm not really from yeah i'm not really from Texas i just live down here now i've i've lived down here a couple year oh you're just living down there yeah i'm originally originally from Colorado but oh well yeah there uh there uh there's a lot of hunters here yeah well i know how you feel i'm uh i grew up in Nebraska and and we always use to go out and hunt all the time you know and uh-huh man there's no way there's no way i would ever go for a total ban on all weapons that's just i don't know i just think i think it's ridiculous i mean yeah it doesn't sit with me very well i don't know i anymore i keep a thirty eight in my truck you know really yeah i just about all well i live in Minneapolis and i well actually i live in Florida but i am staying in Minneapolis for a year uh-huh and you know both areas are pretty crime ridden right now right and it's just you you never know who is out there you know it's just for self protection purposes and then right of course there's the hunting issue so sure yeah that's good that do you do Jeff uh i i'm in uh program control for a company up here oh yeah yeah all right we do schedules yeah programs programs schedule programs what do you do i'm uh researcher of Honeywell up here oh okay so uh yeah you guys uh do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything or uh i haven't had a chance to do any hunting since i've been down here i don't own a shotgun but i'd like to go bird hunting yeah you know that's something i miss quite a bit so yeah uh when i was in Colorado we went dear and elk hunting yeah you you know quite a bit but all right yeah my brother was uh a guide for bear and elk hunts out in Idaho for a while and uh really enjoyed it quite a bit but i don't know i guess that what the scale now is it's zero for uh for a complete one for a total ban and uh that's right i guess i am about eight or nine yeah i i agree with you there yeah no doubt about it but uh i mean if they can anyway get it keep criminals from having guns which they can't yeah i you know i'm not for it yeah if there is if there's a way you know to limit it to to people that i don't know that they they i guess they passed a couple of uh of laws a here while back in some states in terms of a waiting period uh-huh where they you know you go to buy a hand gun and then they actually uh i know it's this way in Florida they have a waiting period where you buy one and that's a week uh-huh and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that i think that's a pretty good idea uh and that's i don't know that's not a bad idea but then again you can always get around that you could go through the black market like you say you know you always be able to get around sure yeah it's one of those things but uh i don't know i guess i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like i'm not real sure why anybody would need a fully automatic weapon yeah i don't either you know i'm just not i think those have been pretty much you know banned altogether anyway yeah i fully auto but even well i mean a semiautomatic i guess that's it kind of takes the sport out of hunting yeah right you know it's like what can you do with that that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a or a or a twenty shot twelve sure you know you might do the same thing right and so it's like i don't know it it it does it takes the sport out of it for me i would much rather have a bow any time oh really yeah i i like bows you know i have done some bow hunting and i uh i get into it and i think it's more of a challenge you know yeah but uh i don't know i guess it keeps the shell makers in business sure but uh i don't know anyway that's about where i stand me too yeah i am about the same way you uh have you uh eaten yet or whatever yeah is it seven o'clock there uh yeah it's about seven fifteen you guys central oh okay how is the weather up there oh it's it's not too good it's kind of rainy actually you know it's is it around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about uh i don't know ten or twenty degrees and it's been up around forty so people are right people are whining about the rain and stuff but not not too bad about the temperature ice is starting to melt and stuff like that so yeah i am just up here for the year or so and it's kind of shock to  i'll talk about my city a little bit okay i've noticed that there's actually being uh quite there's been a quite a bit done uh i noticed that uh the uh several of my uh uh grocery stores have been putting up signs that plastic bags and uh trying to recycle the uh gallon uh containers um-hum um-hum so i i'm beginning to see some uh real positive effects i mean huh although i won't claim that that the that that we're doing everything and it's uh you know i i try to recycle uh papers and cans um-hum um-hum what about glass they have glass uh i have not seen a whole lot of glass but the same time in this area at least when it comes to like uh Coke and Pepsi uh they don't really hardly use any glass huh so they know um here they have um they have trash sorting uh-huh um i mean not not right here where i am but in the in the town next door they have um they have trash sorting and you know they put out aluminum and glass and newspaper in separate bins right and uh i guess there's a lot of raiding by homeless people and that kind of thing because they go out and it's like they they pay for this by the by the by the aluminum they collect right right well i i know that uh uh that's that one thing that uh they're not real good about yet is it seems like the paper sorting you still we still are forced pretty much to take everything in you know we don't really have any help from the sanitation department um-hum um-hum so the life is not easy in that way we still have to kind of take care of our own aluminum uh so it's still up to the individual it's it's not really part of any uh a government sponsored programs or anything i see so so um do you actually live in Atlanta uh yeah uh pretty much i i really don't live in the same county as what you'd call Atlanta central but there's several counties that count as Atlanta um-hum yeah i know the cities are um i think Dekalb you well that's Dekalb actually it's you're right it's spelled that way D D E C A L B but that that's Dekalb Dekalb yeah Dekalb and Fulton i thought it was i thought it was a K i always thought it was a K but um never mind um and uh isn't Fulton what another county that's uh right Fulton and actually also contained in that is Cobb and also contained in that uh to to some extent is Clayton county although it's pretty much uh still in the Atlanta proper um-hum um-hum huh uh but there's no concentrated concept uh on that sense uh we have uh now where's the city the city limits it's kind of odd that a city would actually spread over uh more than one county the city limits would actually fall into more than one county yeah the the the central uh part of the city the downtown area is in Fulton almost exclusively um-hum um-hum uh but yeah i mean i i most cities tend to stay mostly mostly in in in one county so you know yeah in fact San Francisco is entirely within the the the limits of San Francisco County in fact San Francisco County and city have the same city limits so that's kind of a weird thing but um right anyways i guess i'm trying to figure out what else there is out here i mean oh we do get papers uh we get we get some help with the papers uh our our our uh um-hum uh trash company does do a a uh uh if if you sort the papers and and put them in a bag they will put them in a separate area into into the uh uh uh garbage garbage truck i guess i don't know exactly how they do it but they do that yeah that's an interesting term because i mean if you if you think about it's the garbage truck well is it really garbage if they're taking it off to be recycled and somebody's willing to pay for it well it pretty well the the i guess it is in in in that sense uh it still is uh i don't i uh huh the uh the papers themselves i mean they some how put them off to the side and i don't know exactly how they do it uh but they but they they do indicate that service huh i think that we you know i think they ought to really start pushing it more you know the idea that you were talking about where they they separate each each container um-hum that that should be more available we should have more containers in all city uh uh and all the grocery stores right uh to help on on that sort of thing that would that would make it a lot easier i know in uh some cities that they actually distribute out they as part of the the service they give you extra containers that you can that you can put things into so you you know you don't have to go out and buy your own garbage cans and things like that huh huh you have a you have a very uh distinctive accent um where're you from originally well i'm actually originally from Dayton Ohio no kidding but that's  uh i get most of my news uh from newspapers really i read the daily newspaper uh the Houston Chronicle and sometimes i'll read uh like the uh uh Wall Street Journal or The New York Times i don't subscribe to either but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it um how about you do you you mostly get news from TV or newspaper yeah i actually get most of my news coverage off uh computer networks however i do also watch television news uh usually in the morning once a day and i read the front page of the Wall Street Journal most everyday oh uh that's interesting you said computer networks um what uh what sort i'm fairly knowledgeable about oh okay that's interesting uh well well Dow Jones for example have a has a uh a news wire and it's uh it's picked up and actually available um at my office so it's no fee subscription i'm uh very easy to to read at my leisure and um it's sorted by category for example so i can read certain businesses or topics oh is is it is it the AP news wire or is it uh something that's that's a little bit different from that well it's similar to that but it's Dow Jones which is um The Wall Street Journal's news wire uh okay so that that that's interesting okay yeah i've had i had access in the past to uh uh the AP news wire and i found that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news um i've never uh used the Dow Jones news wire but uh yeah it uh do you do you get any uh do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader like more long term analytical sort of approach um well actually not uh i do uh follow um uh uh i don't know how to how to describe it um so it's a religious newspaper which which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense it's a weekly but uh but not um yeah but not like Business Week or uh or News Week or or or one of those kinds of things i i'd like to say that however um that i'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires uh interesting in what way in like in sort of like uh a quality a quality or sort of the orientation in terms of like view point or the way the news is presented or whatever um i i think that it i think it has to do with uh i personally think i i have a problem with their viewpoint and i personally think that uh that there's a strong bias go you well you won't offend me so go ahead and say there's a strong there's a strong bias in the media yeah like liberal a liberal type of bias yeah absolutely after after all who who who writes are people are journalist who are trained to write and they're that's a liberal yeah yeah yeah uh a liberal field at least from academia and uh the other thing that i always notice is that whenever they write about something that i'm yeah yeah an expert in i find their descriptions to be wrong yeah yeah they generally make mistake on anything technical at least but and it that's right well even if it's not technical if it's um social thing or or whatever it doesn't matter if i'm expert in it they usually make mistakes which leads me to believe that the things i'm not expert in that they're telling me lies yeah yeah yeah do you by mistakes do you do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think they're deliberate sorts of things i i think both uh by deliberate um i mean mistakes mistakes of omission or uh or uh bias toward the particular viewpoint particular liberal view point that they have yeah yeah yeah so uh uh well give an example uh you you we'll go out of the printing media i know of cases where um for example in television media where they'll show clippings from one event and describe another event but with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing that they're showing you hm which is sort of like a deliberate bias um which is which is rather disturbing i know ABC does that hm that's disturbing uh i haven't really noticed them doing that but whatever again i don't watch TV news that much now if i had access to CNN i would watch TV news more um i don't you know but i don't usually yeah yeah i don't have access either although i did at one time and uh it was i did during the Gulf War and it was addictive yeah did you did you think that CNN well the Gulf War coverage would be kind of uh uh abnormality i just wonder i guess i'd be curious to know what you thought as to as to how like say CNN TV news compared to the three networks um you know whether you thought it was more or less biased or whatever but i i guess you wouldn't you probably if you just watched it during Gulf War that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much yeah well during that small sample i would say that everyone was just about just about the same except the three networks who also had radio then television programming so if at a particular time you wanted to get yeah the latest and greatest news you could do that by um turning on CNN and you would yeah  so what do you think about uh employers screening you know job candidates for drug drug usage well i can kind of see it both ways because um you don't want to get i guess i generally feel against it but i can see why an employer wouldn't want to have employees that are on drugs right that could cause all kind of problems i'd would like to see it see them be able to not need to screen more than i would like to see them screening right you think it infringes on personal rights to have that type of screening right i think that we ought to be employer certainly has the right to say on the application are you on drugs or something like that and then if they say well i'm on drugs then they say well we would like rather have somebody that isn't on drugs but a lot of times people who are on drugs don't admit it that's right especially when they're trying to get a job and i guess everybody knows that if they're trying to get a job that if they put down that they're on drugs they're not gonna get it right yeah i don't really have that much a problem with drug screening i think um if it's gonna effect their job performance uh i think it's reasonable for an employer to request a drug test but uh right i guess depends on the job some jobs that depend on which public safety depends like um pilots and air traffic controllers people who drive the trains um things like that but i don't think SEPTA actually does um routine screening for their workers and that might not be a bad idea i've see a couple that look like they might be on drugs right yeah it always should be mandatory for some uh positions such as those but um right but other well i don't know every job right i guess i don't know i'd would obviously an employer doesn't wanna have a person on drugs but if somebody's on drugs and they get into the work place it might be uh a better thing for them than to have them out there on the street mugging people that's true that's true you there has to be that's the that's the key i think is is what happens when you find a person who is on drugs you got to just that's when you have to be careful you know you just can't that's right fire every person something needs to be done to help these kind of these people that's right if they now behind the drug testing was something like that so that it wasn't that a person just didn't get a job that right they can go and if they ever tested uh positive on drugs then they'd if that were the case then they'd be always unemployed right there should be some sort of program they can go into to try to clean themselves up and be given a second chance so well some perhaps a program but i know people go into programs there with other people that have a lot of the same problems and that's in some ways good it lets them feel like they have support um-hum but on the other side hand it's they need to be around people that have their lives together and aren't on drugs they need to be you know people wouldn't be getting into trouble as much if they true especially young people here in Philadelphia right if they had if they were so busy during the day that when they went um when they went home at night they were tired and they had to go to sleep right so but if people are not working and they're just running around loose with nothing to do they got a lot of energy and it gets them into trouble right yeah that's true yeah i don't know i'm thinking if from my perspective let's say you owned a business um you would want to have the opportunity to screen any uh candidate for a job within your own company um-hum and if you put yourself in that situation you don't want to hire someone who's on cocaine right are you in business no but i i could it's something i may do eventually so um from that perspective i can i'd see the need for drug testing uh-huh right more more or less for large businesses than small businesses i think mostly go on personal contacts and who knows who and what people they know would say about them um-hum so with thinking about my daddy and working down on the farm in South Carolina and hiring people and you know even at fast food restaurants and um field work it's the person doing the hiring and the supervisor going and talking to people and finding out who know what about who right i guess it's kind of the old boy network maybe that isn't as much so in the larger cities like Philadelphia well uh right yeah you can't really do that you could be hiring someone for uh uh a managerial white collar position in your company and uh the person can appear very right well qualified and and perfectly normal but uh they may be having a lot more problems um-hum yeah they can  so do you have kids in the public school system uh no i don't i'm a college student actually no kids yet oh yeah well i've got preschoolers so we have one that is going to be starting kindergarten next year and uh uh-huh i don't know if i'm real comfortable with the public schools at this point but um right home schooling right now is not an option for us so uh-huh and private private schools um i don't know yeah so you have to deal with it what you have but um pretty expensive right um i don't know i'm what do you think about the school systems uh i think that there's a lot that could be done to improve them i uh being that i'm in college and stuff you get to college and you see you know it just seems it seems like that we ought to be doing a lot of the things that are that are done in college i guess should be taught a lot earlier in school like in math and science and stuff like that yeah i mean i'm a math major and when i was in high school you know i i think i could of handled a lot of the work that i've been doing here in college at a much younger age and i believe that that's the way that it used to be in this country a long time ago and that it probably is in a lot of other countries too because your your math professors or whatever whatever will always go yeah i was doing this stuff back in high school and you're like well you know then why the heck is it you know my third year in college and i'm just now getting to it yeah it just seems like that they've the curriculum in the public schools is just too soft or something yeah they're i feel like they're trying to teach a lot of um they're taking the role of the parent and trying to teach a lot of uh of values and doing a lot of baby sitting and and not getting down to what they need to be teaching right and um yeah there's a lot of things that i i wanna teach my kids and i don't want them to mess around with right um you know i don't feel like that's their that's their place um one of the things that uh my husband works for uh for a company that well well he works for Frito-Lay but they had a a guy come in um talking about some of the new IBM um systems that they have coming out and talking about how school systems are just are not transitioning as as rapidly as um as a lot well industry industry right now is is just gonna have to uh you know well in a transition period with the computers and stuff and um that was real encouraging as i we we went and looked at the uh-huh the kindergarten class that my little boy will go into and they have reading to write which is uh they can write stories and and learn to write on computers so at least uh the school district that we're in has you know computers that they begin on and i really feel like uh-huh right um they're going to have to use those a lot and and that way a child that my son already know already knows how to read and he will be able to excel at his own pace where the kids that you know right that don't have you know that haven't had the he has a real desire to learn and hopefully he will be challenged throughout you know his school life if he's of you know that things are available to him like the computer right go off and and teach himself yeah because i know there's a lot of a lot of junk that i learned in school and it's been it's been a number of years since i've been in high school and college and um work at his own pace they uh you know some of the stuff i learned it was such a such a waste of time right and um i come back and i got a degree in uh i got a business degree in college and that's the most useless degree in the world it's like why did they do this to people and um you have to you know you have to uh-huh right uh you really have to work with um what's out there in the environment and use it to your advantage in the schools right now it's just they're just beginning i think to to take advantage of the computers and and of course not all schools are able to do that because of the expense of them but um right well i agree very highly with your point about the the uh public schools have gotten away from the real sort of hard core curriculum and into areas that are more should be dealt with at home or in the Church or somewhere else yeah dealing with value judgements and dealing with how you how you interact with the rest of society because i feel that those are really things that that have no place in the school i mean i i see that they're they're trying to uh i don't know what they are trying to do but i really think that the emphasis should be more on on book learning and not on okay you know here's our civics class this is we're going to talk about how people deal with each other in their community and how it's suppose to be and as opposed to just having straight up math reading writing um-hum  hi Ed hello Carolyn do you uh work for a large organization yes i work for North Carolina State University which has about six or seven thousand employees wow what do you do are you i'm an associate professor in electrical and computer engineering and computer science i see and you work for TI yes and you do i'm a computer scientist um-hum and always concerned about benefits right well i i'm on the benefits committee here one of about twenty people in the university so that's why i checked that topic oh you are i see uh what do you think people's concern is about benefits is it mostly in the area of health care i swear that's what i was going to say we seem to get more more uh complaints about that than about anything else although you get a good deal of complaints over other kinds of insurance too um yeah health care we have we are on the state health system which is my understanding is that it is a lot worse than the system we had when we had our own just for the university and i wouldn't be real surprised if that's the case um uh yeah they people are uh complaining because the rates for families uh what you know the the uh uh the additional amount you have to pay to cover a family has gone up quite rapidly oh yeah yeah well we've our benefits have changed recently to where we have network doctors and network hospitals kind of uh a preferred provider uh-huh and the you wouldn't believe the complaints huh because you know you're family doctor may not happen to be in the network right and uh so there uh you your benefits are reduced if you don't go to a network doctor well do you yeah but i mean do people get to choose whether to take the the preferred preferred provider or not that's right that's right you get to choose whether or not you want to change doctors huh right but so so so people would stay in an existing plan that that didn't require you to go to a preferred provider in that case right no no the the plan allows you to do either one the benefits that are paid are considerably better when uh with the preferred provider we are with the preferred provider yes huh wonder about the economics of that uh the uh you know twenty years ago when HMO's just got started uh when they started enrolling a lot of people uh it was felt that this would be the way to control health care costs and it worked to some degree but it didn't work that much and the reason was adverse selection the people that go into HMO's are are those that have uh you know that that have generally lesser health needs and i mean it's obvious why that is because the people that that that are already sick are going to see a particular doctor and they don't want to switch just to come in the HMO so you get the people in the H O they they don't uh you know require that much uh care at all and then some how you got less people paying premiums into the into the uh insurance system than you have uh uh you you have almost as many claims so uh that's that's caused a problem uh have you heard about uh cafeteria the cafeteria plan of benefits yes uh i don't think we have a very good cafeteria being a university industry tends to have a lot better programs well i don't know i i would i'd be interested in seeing in learning more about that because uh-huh uh i have no children so i am not interested really in child care benefits except i suppose as a citizen of the world or something uh-huh right well i i don't know i mean the questions is should should it be the employer that pays for child care uh if if there were a tax credit then everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also be better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more yeah yeah i just i i like the concept of being able to choose which benefits are more important to you so oh yes no that that that it's true that's that's important i agree uh yeah that's true and child care is one of the big ones that that gets thrown in um well you know if you were married to a doctor then you might not need so much medical care medical insurance or something i don't know i don't know about that you'd have you'd you'd have your office visits covered but that's only a small part of the total yeah i'm sure but yeah uh on the other hand you know maybe maybe if you had false teeth you wouldn't care about dental insurance uh well i think you probably would need more denture work wouldn't you now i don't care too much about dental work because of of their dental the dental insurance because i rarely well almost never for the last eight years have i used up enough to would you i don't know uh you know paid enough in in dental bills to uh come up to even the smallest amount you can set aside monthly uh but not everybody is like that and people who have kids that need uh you know an orthodontist services certainly would not be in that situation yeah that's right but that you know people like  okay um what do you think well it depends on whether i have to buy my next car before or after my children are out of the house well that makes a big difference doesn't it we've we've gone from small cars and sports cars to station wagons and a van a mini van it's kind of like well if right a little more domestic there yeah yeah i i guess the biggest factor for me lately is American versus non American and while i'd really like to buy American i don't know it just it really depends on reliability for me yeah uh i have a Ford right now and it's been a pretty good truck but some of the things are not that good about it and Ford sales have been really bad in terms of customer uh customer service at least for me so it's i don't know it's it's kind of disappointing well well when we i guess this is talking about previous cars opposed to to next car but when we went to look for a mini van i wanted to get you know i thought it'd be nice to buy American and i went and looked at all the American ones but yeah and the doors didn't close right and the i mean and this is on the lot and you're thinking to yourself if it's not right now what is it gonna be like after i've had it for six months yeah right so well one of the good i guess one of the good things that i have to work on is my my father he's a pharmaceutical rep and he he gets a new car about once every three years yeah uh-huh and he's been driving a lot of mini vans in the last like five or ten years yeah and uh he generally goes with i think the Astro Van yeah um it's the only one that has a standard six cylinder which is real important to him but i don't know i guess i guess for my next car i'd probably have to probably have to scale down to an actual car instead of a pick up starting to get into that i'm a college student right now i'm a doctoral student uh-huh and uh i anticipate getting a full time job soon so you know probably one of those things where i really don't need the the hauling capacity much i'll be a little more stable but yeah well i guess i don't know i'm i i think i'll probably buy American but i'm just not real sure you know you have to go out of here go talk to dad yeah well um i know i've i've always looked for mileage um-hum uh you know cause i figure the the better miles it gets the better but the less pollutants it's putting out cause the better job it's doing burning stuff up sure and i yeah uh and that opens up a whole another can of worms i guess Ford is suppose to start out with they're gonna actually put out a line of electric cars next year in California yeah doesn't that sound neat if you were gonna if you if you could afford two cars and you were going to do a lot of city driving you know yeah um-hum oh that'd be a definite yeah that'd be the way to go for sure i think there's no questions in in in terms of whether i would have that or not i go away from here sounds like your kids want to get on the conversation just a minute David remove Jeffrey from my presence i'm on the telephone i bet they'd have something to say about buying cars huh well my my kids oh my kids think it's great we've unfortunately our convertibles have been retired for lack lack of time on our part to um to work on them but we have a Fiat an old Fiat and an old MGB yeah oh really sitting in behind our house and the kids are convinced the older two kids are convinced that that's going to be their cars Jeffrey hasn't figured out yet just you know it's like who want oh Jeffrey's only three you know and the but the other ones aren't very old either how old are they oh i see uh-huh so it's like who's going to inherit you know Jeffrey's like well you know station wagon a mini van you know you got to go get another old convertible my husband well my husband would love to buy next is a Miata right yeah oh yeah you know is the Mazda Miata yeah i've heard some good things about that car actually it's suppposed to be yeah really solid car we have a a Mazda right now yeah a big factor for me is is ergonomics and and in terms of control and display design that's that's what i'm going into for my degree yeah oh neat and so that's that's something i really try to consider a little more heavily heavily than most people probably do but well it they have something that you know i there's some things i like better about my Subaru and some things i like better about the Mazda and uh you know and i'm always looking at that kind of thing at other people's cars and um-hum yeah yeah it it it's amazing how much spot light it's gotten lately you know it seems like everyone that's a big concern now you know it's well it's not just you know but like i have one car that tells me which door is open and the other one only tells me that a door is open yeah uh-huh so when it only tells me that a door is open i have to get out of the car and go around slamming doors until i mean that's a nuisance that's a real pain yeah yeah um and one of them only has the standard full to empty gauge and the other  well do you have children no you don't have children no and my children are in their twenties now so oh child care is something that i i no longer fortunately have to take care of but it is something that was hard at the time just finding finding sitters i did not work though so i didn't have to uh have to worry about you know all day during the day which i think is a real problem yeah yeah i agree uh cause i suppose when when i do start having children uh i'd like to stay home for a while but uh you know eventually i'd i might have to put them in day care to work i and i think it's hard to find um good day care because just the other night um on the news in Milwaukee um they're closing down a day care because um the lady who owns um slapped a child uh-huh and um she had a lot of um like um um what did she have um like tickets against her um saying that the she didn't have proper food um prepared for them oh boy and that it was just dirty and and she didn't take very good care of the kids and you know you don't want to send your kids to place like that no it's really scary and there does seem to be more and more of that if people are doing it instead of grandmothers and aunts and you know right that kind of thing where where people are doing it for money and trying to make ends meet then it's it it becomes an entirely different thing right and we keep reading about all these different things that go on child abuse and um-hum and people with criminal records etcetera i think it would be very frightening um-hum yeah and i know some companies have child care facilities at the company but not many of them do right or you have to um it's pretty expensive i yeah the college i go to they have uh child care um there but you still have to pay you know it doesn't come with them do you know how much it is no i don't yeah yeah but that's what i've heard is that that you've got to earn an awful lot i mean you know a lot of times the wife's money basically covers what you have to pay out so that doesn't help right it's like uh uh if you do work most of the money goes back into taking care of your child so uh-huh uh-huh you might as well stay home if you're married yeah that's right well i i and and uh and then there's the question of you know if what what to look for what's what's going to be uh what's going to be a good place and uh do they right do they turn out as well as the ones where the mother stays home that's that's a really difficult issue i know yeah i've i've heard a lot of things about that too um with some people say it's not healthy for your children to be in day care and you know other's say it is so i don't know uh-huh you you haven't decided yet huh uh no no i think it's going to be hard i feel like i was i was lucky to get to be at home and there were a lot of times that it was boring and it and it certainly isn't true is true that didn't didn't set me up for a career but at the same time uh it felt good to be there when they got home from school yeah those were the stories that that that i got to hear it was even hard to get their father to get to hear them you know they would come home and they'd say all this and then later on you say well tell dad about you know and they go oh i already told you you know it all gone kind of thing yeah oh and that parts good and you get to see them as they progress etcetera yeah um-hum but at the same time if you don't have enough money or if you are trying to build a career you know then you have to give everything up just to stay home and i think that's a real question yeah that is it's a tough decision and uh do you know uh you say they have it at school is it for the students or for the teachers or for both um-hum um i think it's for for the students uh-huh yeah i don't know if it would it's it makes sense to have it for the teachers too uh-huh but um i'm not really sure i haven't looked into it i don't need it well what about you and your own background did did your mother or father stay home or did did they work or um yeah my mom stayed home um she had four kids and she stayed home with all of us until i got into about kindergarten and then she went um back to work after and so you so you were in school right and when you came home from school was there some one there or was uh what happened i mean did she get off when you got home or was there some one taking care of you like an older brother or sister or um do you remember for a while she was there um when i got home but then um and she started working later until like four and i would come home first and i and my brothers and sisters were all older than me so so you had there was some one there to take care of you yeah yeah um-hum yeah there was already somebody home yeah cause i think that's another  okay well uh i guess since i called i'll start out with my feelings about it uh i think that it's absolutely essential that some some at least some employees of government agencies and companies be tested especially when it effects public safety i mean the military obviously uh people that run trains and airplanes and and the like um-hum uh for others i don't know i don't feel as strong about it uh i don't really don't have any objection to it but i can't really say i'm for it either what's your feeling well uh it it it it becomes sort of a a topic where i sit there and and i have a knee jerk reaction and then i have a a reaction after i think about it a little longer uh for me i i guess i feel like uh we have we we that we when we give in on these things we tend to move towards a a uh society where uh everything is a is uh regulated uh i think you're right about uh certain jobs and uh certainly something like uh a bus train pilots uh it's obviously something that's a necessity it because it because the function of the job is is within all everyone pretty much everyone in the world uh would admit to the fact that that these drugs might impair their abilities uh-huh okay yeah and like so i guess in some ways i'm agreeing with you uh that those would be something that should continue to have uh drug testing of course it is certainly not acceptable for an Eastern pilot to uh have just had eight martinis before he went off to fly right or Northwest i think Northwest has had a lot of problems with that right i uh i've been in uh two two situations where i've had to under go grug testing drug testing i was in the military for a number of years um-hum and then i worked for four years uh as a as a an electrical inspector uh in a nuclear plant that was under construction and in both cases uh you know we were subject to uh to random testing for drugs and i know a lot of people refused to a lot especially at the nuclear plant or would uh you know strongly object to it but uh you know i could see the need for it so i i went along with it i i think if i were a clerical worker for instance though uh and really couldn't have effected anybody else i'm not sure that i'd i think it might be inappropriate for us to say for me to say that in any in any industry uh something where where see you're talking about a plant where okay if you're a nuclear inspector um-hum or where you're a uh person who works on safety features for nuclear inspection well that makes sense um-hum uh-huh but uh we're talking about you you know you're saying well uh and i think you uh that you just stated the same thing that if you were a clerical you you you know a clerical person there or you were a secretary there now where's the justification uh-huh right what what what okay you know let's say that we can you you you you had had a uh uh you went to a party and uh not not that anyone ever does it but you were smoking pot uh now how is that going to make any difference um um-hum you know unless you very unless you uh uh PCP does exist apparently in the blood stream uh-huh for a long period of time but the ability for you to function seems to be right uh very it it's very questionable as to whether it has any real effect upon you right probably alcohol has more of an effect for for a shorter period of time right so but i I just went through one recently uh-huh and uh the place i just transferred jobs not too long ago and so i went through the whole process and the uh-huh uh-huh there's really no justification what so ever for why i had to do it i mean uh uh-huh it's a company that it's basically a oh management engineering company um-hum so they were doing it just to they wanted to make sure that their employees were productive probably that's why now what wait but then but then uh but then if the if you're saying that that's probably why they justified it uh no i'm just trying to imagine why they would wanna test you they should also regulate right what they should also regulate how many hours of sleep i must have they should also regulate how much what kind of nutrition i have they should also regulate see it's a it's a it's a disturbing trend right right yeah i i think that people who do something that could hurt somebody else right uh should be subject to the testing i guess that's probably the the way i'd term it and i'm talking about bus drivers as you mentioned and pilots and what have you uh others that really can only hurt themselves shall we say uh um-hum  how's the quality of air in Portland very good really uh well let me put it this way it's it's relatively uh it's very good if if you are a little bit away from the city and it's and it's wonderful on days that it rains um-hum but uh downtown they have a few problems but it's um-hum probably a lot of ozone lot of smog but it's fairly localized it's not like uh Los Angeles where i used to live yeah it oh yeah i've heard that Los Angeles is horrible and Denver is i hear is really bad yes yes uh Atlanta's Atlanta's moderately bad um you know we have we have a big problem with ozone um and you know it's generally you know it's it it's quite often you know be a very hazy sort of day you know because there'll just be this pollution hanging in the air um i think a lot i think well i think most of our problems caused by automobile emissions because you know it's a very you know mobile city it i guess that's the the major problem with most cities except except places like uh um-hum oh Mexico City or some place like that well i guess it's it's a problem there too but but they do have some places where that's caused by power plants and and stuff like that um-hum hm um-hum of heavy industry yeah i think i think the has been you know relatively good about um you know having regulations at least in the last twenty years or so about industry industry pollution but it just seems that i think i think i think we really suffer because you know we don't have any sort of an organized mass transit system any sort of you know like high speed rail or even you know even even you know decent regular passenger rail across the country um it seems it seems like like there's a lot you know there's a lot there's a lot more federal subsidies for automobile you know for through through the construction through the construction of highways for automobiles yeah although there is one thing that i uh i learned in in yeah chemistry many years ago and that's uh i don't know are are you a chemist hm i know a little bit of chemistry okay anyway this is principle called Le Chatelier's principal as i remember and it's basically uh uh when you have uh a reaction and it it uh the reaction will go until it until until it kind of comes to a balance but if you take away some of the products of that reaction then the reaction will go farther um-hum um-hum um-hum and so uh the illustration that the chemistry teacher pointed out was he said he said in a in a desirable area people will move in until until bad things happen that cause the uh desirabilities to go to um-hum you know to uh balance kind of balance out he says if it's not air pollution it'll be um-hum it will be uh congestion or price of land or something like that so what i'm looking at here in the Portland area is is a temporary situation it's a very desirable area as far as i'm concerned and uh um-hum um-hum um-hum the wonderful air the lack of of uh congestion the low low cost of of uh property uh um-hum in a few years something's going to cause i mean there's uh people just going to continue to move in until we either um-hum until just gets the air it can't just it can't support them and the quality of life they want and and and as many people move in as move out um-hum and it'll come to a balance and then if they come along and they add new freeways so let's say they reduce traffic congestion then air pollution will get bad or something else and that's happened in California that's for sure um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum uh as far as in Atlanta do they have a uh do they have uh regulations on on uh like inspection um they they do have automobile automobile emissions tests but um it's there there's some sort of rule i don't have a car so i don't know the actual specifics but it's like if your your car is if the make if the model model year of your car is like more than twenty years old you don't have to have it inspected any more yeah the grandfather type thing you know which is which is just kind of ludicrous you know because those are the ones that you'd expect to yeah you know be the hardest be the most biggest polluters although i think that's partly because it's harder to get parts and and uh yeah it's true so let's see what was my other question uh my wife thinks this is uh a uh sales call so she's telling me to talk to you about one of the problems with uh she thinks it's from from uh our cable company uh let's see what else we have uh uh let's see do you live you don't live too close do you live close to the city or far away from it i basically live downtown okay downtown and i go to school at Georgia Tech which is pretty much located in the heart of downtown or within a mile from the heart of downtown do they have smog days there uh it's i don't think it's really announced you know in the sense that the way it the way it is in California but um i have heard on the news in the you know in the past couple of months or so that you know that apparently there's some federal guidelines for um smog and Atlanta's like it  okay Eric um are you married and do you have a family uh yes i am to uh both questions okay and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances uh yeah we do we um uh basically there's the you know expenses that are fixed during the month you know the ones that come every every month and uh-huh we uh enter those into uh into a spread sheet and uh what's ever left uh after that we you know we we sit down and agree on kind of what you know what sort of range we're gonna uh-huh generally gonna shoot for i see um so what do you do well that's basically what we do um about every every three months or so we reevaluate our budget and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest um-hum and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks i work part time at night and he works and my husband works full time days and so we have the four pay checks with that works out nice because we get paid every week wow and so that does help that helps a lot yeah and then um we don't have a lot extra extra for extra spending so it's pretty well earmarked yeah all allocated out yeah yeah every every penny is earmarked but um it we have found that that works the best and and so if we can just divide them up all the major bills up in fact we found it easier to divide the major bills up you know cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half and and divide those up between all all the um-hum and so we are not taking a huge sum out out of one and then the next pay check we're real short or checks yeah right yeah we found that um it's definitely helped uh get a handle on kind of the unnecessary expenses we were before we started doing that kind of a thing we were um spending uh that's true money for things that you know we probably tended to eat out a bit more than the than we should have and it was easy to uh let things get out of hand we thought it uh uh-huh thought it to be really helpful we've gotten some of our loans paid off early yeah because of this and and stuff like that so well it helps you to focus where your money goes and and i'm sure you felt the same the same frustration before you got on a budget but yeah you're wondering my when you put down all the money that you do bring in and then you're saying my word where did all that money go where does it go that's a lot of money but yeah huh and also we have found that if we write down and and we did this we're not real consistent with this but we did it for about a month and we wrote down everything that we bought with you know every paycheck um-hum and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend and and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it it's we should because it does help yeah the other the other thing that that we've found that that helps if you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to uh uh get out the money in advance and put it in uh uh-huh um so long as it wasn't you know unreasonably high but for things like food expenses or or whatever just put it in a uh-huh in an envelope or whatever and that way it kind of forced us to uh stick to that amount just stick to that uh-huh that is and then once that was gone well if the entertainment amount was gone for the month oh it's gone uh-huh yeah that that sounds like a really good idea so and it really helpful um have you developed a savings plan or IRAs or anything like that yet we we haven't we our our initial goal was just to retire our debt uh completely retire our debt for car payments and credit card oh uh-huh uh-huh uh credit card debt and and all of that and we're just at a point where where we could start thinking about it so oh that's good that's a good feeling yeah i my husband just graduated from the university uh a year ago so finally finally we are getting to that point too so are you still going to school or um-hum a study yeah yeah i'm actually in the in the master  i guess that starts it um all right go so um i guess right now what's most important for me uh doing is coming up is we have a really good stock program uh where i work and it's gonna give me about a three hundred percent return this time around on my uh investment good which is definitely helping since i'm gonna buy a house is what do they what do they give you stock in the company you work for yeah what they do is what they do is it's it's a purchase program where you get the stock it's it's it's on a one year cycle and you get it at eighty five percent of the lower of the beginning and the end price for the year so like the the set price at the beginning of the year last May was five sixty four a share right stocks trading about fourteen now wow so and you so i'll get to buy it at five sixty four four and turn around the same day the only down side is they do it as a withholding off your uh income so you got to kind of you know be willing to squirrel away at whatever you wanna do yeah yeah that sounds good yeah what company is that that's with Interleaf excuse me Interleaf Interleaf never heard of it uh desktop publishing oh okay so but um you know yeah what are we supposed to talk about salaries benefits besides salary is that yeah benefits other than salary yeah but i i get a i get a pretty good i work for the City of New York um-hum and i get a pretty good um health plan and yeah but that that's definitely a good thing to have especially these days yeah the health plan's pretty good and and we get um they also have a deferred compensation plan which is similar to what you're talking about where they'll they'll take out money tax free from your income and invest it right and it's a group investment so you i think you also save fees what is what is that like a uh like a uh TIACREF type thing it's like a 401K plan except they don't they don't contribute okay yeah so it's for retirement right yeah so you you have to wait until like fifty five or yeah i think i think you can take out the money anytime you want but you'll pay you'll pay taxes on it and you're better off waiting until you retire when you are probably going to have less income or some something like that right yeah we we we've got a 401K here but um i chose to go into the stock program because you can't lose on it and you know i can always take the money off of that if i wasn't saving up for the house i would be putting money into a 401K but you know i'd much rather get the eighteen eighteen percent minimum return on the stock and use that for the house yeah uh but yeah you know medical medical is good you know we get a good program here what's basically a hundred percent coverage for about twenty bucks a month wow that's that's really good it's like your yeah it is it's a very good company as far as benefits go they've got 401K's they've got uh the health coverage they've got you know the stock program they've got uh 125K selling it for twenty bucks they do put it in the dental you know dental is like you know eighty or fifty percent depending on what you're doing right um and you know you the 125K means i can pay that piece out of pre tax money rather than post tax the only problem with 125K is you got to say at the beginning of the year i think i'm gonna have a thousand dollars of expenses this year and then you have to be willing to have that money deducted from your salary and if you don't use the thousand dollars it goes away if you own oh okay i see so at the end of the year if you haven't used it all up it's you know the feds take it or or whoever takes it it just disappears but you know if if you know you know so you wanna underestimate a little bit so like you know i know i easily have a thousand dollars or five hundred dollars a year of dental and and miscellaneous miscellaneous medical and deductibles right so i just have them pull you know five hundred it means i pay like you know as opposed to paying like you know eight hundred dollars i pay or five hundred i pay like three hundred because it's on pre tax hello yeah i'm here yeah it uh it was a width away that's why it's it's every time i talk it sounds weird but uh yeah there's there's other benefits too noneconomic i mean there's there's uh yeah yeah there's benefits just in working for a big organization i think in in that you have a lot of uh different people doing a lot of different things and yeah i i think it it depends how flat the organization is if you know hang on my computer is talking to me um you know it depends how flat it is if it's um okay i don't like working in an organization where you're really deep in the tree because then you start to feel like you've got no real you know power to change anything right well that's working for the city is somewhat like that except for my unit you know i have control over what goes on in my unit and and just that right um but what i mean is i i say for instance i'm an attorney uh a collection attorney for the City of New York and and in the environmental control board and um-hum um-hum um-hum i'm i've learned so much about computer systems and sharing of information all these managerial type things that i never thought i'd be involved with and if i was in private practice i'd never be able to learn all that stuff yeah but there's two sides to that because also you know i've seen a lot of i knew somebody who worked for Digital and for two years he worked on like you know the tape driver for one tape drive and that's all he did  music do you like um lots of different kinds i guess um i like country music of course Texas and i listen to Christian music a lot because um-hum there's a Christian music station here in in our city so i listen to it quite a bit um-hum so i'm more into rock and roll myself um-hum and i listen because on Friday nights they have the um they have what they call Saturday Night Live or they have it on Saturday night Friday night and Saturday night and they have Christian rock and roll um-hum so you know they have that type of music but they just have different words um-hum um-hum so i listen to that too do you like any bluegrass no not really hum-um oh well at least your and i like i like rap music do you like rap music not really not really well i can tell we're we're together here okay oh um we'll have to um i have a lot of friends that like country music what kind of rock what kind of rock music do you listen to do you listen listen to like that really heavy metal stuff or no i'm more into um older rock like psychedelic the psychedelic era like uh seventies what the seventies late sixties seventies um Greatful Dead Crosby Stills and Nash uh-huh yeah i have friends that like that yeah so you've never heard of like the Christian music that i listen to probably then oh i've heard a little bit of it i've just like have you heard of um of Carmen have you ever heard of Kim uh now i've heard of Striper Striper they're the really heavy yeah like the heavy metal stuff i guess it's like the only one i can um-hum um-hum um i've heard some Amy Grant before she was you know became more mainstream top forty yeah yeah because she she plays both secular and Christian so um-hum yeah i like her too um i have been to a concert a couple of times of hers and i've never actually seen her in concert i imagine that she puts on a pretty good show she does she's real good she's real good um-hum so i like her um-hum um i like some country music uh it's just that i like finding a lot of it's i don't like the country music that's like my wife left me my dog left me everybody's left me yeah mama got run over by the train yeah i don't like that um-hum you know i like Randy Travis um-hum you know i like more of the real new ones like Garth Brooks you know Garth Brooks oh yes you know he's fine yeah i like them i don't care for the older you know like my dog left me stuff huh Reba McIntyre hm you don't like Patsy Cline you don't like Patsy Cline no huh-uh i don't even really know who she is you know you know so no but have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like that music that you like to um yes actually i went to just went to just see the Greatful Dead about i guess about a week ago but aren't they done with i thought that they no they're still they're still on tour they've been touring since late sixties and i just thought that they done broke up and no they're they're still together left hm they're still making albums wow i didn't know that um-hum hm uh that's interesting in fact i mean there are people that you know basically just follow them around from city to city on tour um-hum selling tie dyes and things like that um because they're on up there in age aren't they yeah they're they're like late forties early fifties but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement okay all right they seem to have you know they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players they keep on dying and they keep on replacing them and the new ones in his thirties you know oh all right uh but uh because they look pretty rough i mean i've seen like picture of them and they just yeah well they don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones i just i i don't know if you saw the tour posters for the Rolling Stones when they last toured but i mean it looked like leather day at the geriatric yeah i mean because they just all their faces were just all shriveled and uh-huh yuck looking i mean ugh um um-hum i mean it just just looked like you know they got a bunch of retirees and put them in leather jackets and blue jeans um-hum well are you into that that rock music you know all that druggie stuff and all that i mean well uh you know what i'm saying like i mean like they come on the stage and like you know you they're not even know they're there you know they're just so out of it i prefer my my performers to be pretty sober you know just uh just so that you know that if they're jamming you know that they don't just lose themselves and you know go into la la land yeah um-hum so i just i just don't like you know um-hum that so i don't know so um have you seen any concerts lately hm huh  so uh does your company do any sort of drug testing yeah they do do random drug testing i i work in the defense industry uh-huh and so they're they're they're pretty concerned about something like that although in my mind i don't i don't like the idea of having a having like a hit squad come in uh-huh and suddenly like you know put my employment on the line over uh my lifestyle choices considered uh-huh i i don't think considering i don't think it affects my job and like nobody um nobody's life is at at risk i don't think they should really care what i do in my spare time um-hum so what are they worried about are they worried about i mean do you is this a secure environment you're in i think i'm not i'm not really sure i think that they're worried that you might uh if if if you're a drug addict you could probably compromise government secrets or something like that uh-huh but i i think it's a pretty conservative approach to you know uh uh things i think it's like a fifties approach to a to a an an eighties or nineties lifestyle you know i i don't know i think drugs are pretty pervasive in our society uh yeah and not to mention the legal ones which they don't even care about and yeah well also i what i think is a a problem is that there's a there's a lot of things out there that will actually make let you test positive for drugs when you're you're not even um-hum uh-huh like not even on drugs right and you'll be penalized i mean you could lose your job very easily right i did you see that thing on uh 60 Minutes about the uh the Air Force pilot who um they there was a mistake at the lab no and oh it was on in 60 Minutes there was a mistake at the lab and he he tested he was a B fifty two bomber pilot okay and he he tested positive and he it ruined his career he right he uh he was drummed out of the Air Force and he spent i think something like seven years working you know before he was able to work his way back through the the courts to be uh you know i guess it's called exonerated i guess so right but by then his career is was was ruined because oh yes his life is over at that point yeah he's he he was seven years and it was just like it it was a an accident yeah i've read things that talk about the number of false or negatives and uh-huh to the number of false positives and you know the number of people you're going to hurt while accomplishing you know whatever you think you're accomplishing is really quite high yeah oh you know but i but i also uh you know you read things about uh like train car conductors uh-huh uh which you think of the you like the ticket takers well no i'm talking about like the guy no i'm i'm talking about the the engineers now that that is pretty scary though engineer it is the only thing is i my what i think is they they're testing for you know especially illegal drugs is part of the real problem the real problem is you want to make sure this guy is on the ball uh-huh and i think that what they should be doing is performance testing not drug testing you know they should have some sort of video game or something that the guy has to play or you know something like that because if he you know maybe he didn't get any sleep the night before uh-huh yeah and uh just stayed up too late and for that reason is not on the ball or he's you know he he's unhappy about something or he's sick yeah or uh you know uh using some legal drug that they don't test for i mean i really don't want to be i don't want to die in a train wreck right and and it's because i don't want to die that i want them to do a more meaningful test yeah but then again uh you know i also if i was a conductor i i i wouldn't want i wouldn't want to have to like you know piss in a little paper cup whenever you know well i can see there be yeah i actually it's some some mixed mixed feeling about feel i mean i feel like okay if you're going to do testing do a meaningful test like a performance test um-hum uh the testing itself uh i could see where the testing if it's not if it is a performance test i mean it's directly related doing your job uh-huh uh it has nothing to do with your personal you know lifestyle uh yeah uh by then i had just had a thought about like what about a what about a police officer you know um-hum i mean that then you begin to to wonder if i understand they have like random law enforcement officers have to go through through random random tests just to see i guess like what side of the law they are they're on you know and and i'm beginning i'm i'm starting to think a little more a little more about this is that i guess should we really be talking about what should we be should we have legalized drugs you know well a lot of people say that that would simplify a lot of things uh i tend to i tend to agree just because the attempts to make certain things illegal were such flops yeah i i think that uh  yeah uh uh uh capital punishment i understand means if somebody commits a serious enough crime we kill them that's correct is that your understanding of it right uh-huh well let me put it bluntly there's not too many things that Arabs do right but one of the things they do is have a low crime rates they don't have too many repeat offenders right and they have uh very serious capital punishment over there yes i i really think that um there is room for that i feel like if anybody has committed murder and they and they convict them that they definitely and they're sentenced to life in prison then it's not fair to have us to pay for them to stay there for life and then get paroled and go back out hum-um hum-um hum-um i believe that if they're convicted and it's um you know the only scary part i see in that is a crooked law system that would put people to death without enough evidence yeah to close the case do you know what i mean yeah that shouldn't shouldn't happen but unfortunately it it can right uh i i'm in i think we're pretty much in agreement uh in Texas this death by injection seems about as civilized a way as you can do it i guess well i don't think it's too uh productive to put someone in prison for a life time or like they say sometimes people get eight life sentences on top of each other yeah and then get out in what right and um then they're repeat offenders um i went to school with one of Ted Bundy's attacked girls um hm she was um older than me she was three years older but she went to the same high school as i did and we all knew when she was taken and he had been under suspicion and everything at that point he killed her and i think he killed her definitely uh-hum oh my gosh well i was in the University of Texas years ago when one guy killed two girls in his room and hid the bodies in the field and every now that was in the sixties every now and then he comes up for parole it just scary that he could actually get back out right um i think that in my belief i believe we uh i believe that if a person has killed then there really isn't much point to them going on anyway because they pretty much ruined what they came to earth to do you know what they're here to do to try to make life um the best that they can um-hum what would you think about public executions i definitely no i don't think so i don't think that that's something that we should try to get excited about watching like boxing or some sport i don't agree with that and i don't even think that they need to televised have more than just a couple people in there to make sure that it's done and it should be i think it should be done as painlessly and just done as nicely as it can be but i don't believe in keeping all these prisoners what do you think hm uh if if it's death let's get it over and done with uh the appeal process should be speeded up quite quickly quite quickly they had this guy on the news that's been around since seventy six and he's cost us over four million dollars so far right uh let's speed it up be sure it's as close to being accurate as possible and get it over and done with on the other hand it may not be capital punishment if you committed armed robbery and get caught you shouldn't be out you shouldn't serve one day and get credit for five or or ten days uh that maybe off the subject but uh oh i think that there should be capital punishment even for other things i think somebody that's caught selling drugs oh yeah if that shouldn't be capital punishment but if they're the high ones that are making these drugs and importing them i think that you could consider that because in essence they're taking lives um-hum oh i'd i i'd go with the ones on the street corner because people are thinking you know what am i going to get five years if i'm caught so what's the big deal no yeah start at the bottom start pushing the ones on the street corner they'll run out of supplies yep i'm i'm cruel on that drugs have no place at all no um and um so i i i think that it could go even farther than um-hum i think that i don't know it's hard you don't want to be so mean that you're you're doing away with people that have a chance to change but then i you look at the reports of people that are in prison and they act like they're reformed and then they get out and they repeat repeat these offenses right fairly quickly so fairly quickly i don't have uh you know we're in so much agreement i guess i'm try to play the devil's advocate uh yeah as a Christian i can't even be the devil's advocate i'm a Christian and i still think there's an appropriate place for it that's yeah i'm i'm a Christian also and that's why you get in the situation where um it says how i believe but if a person's committed murder that's an unpardonable sin uh and so why should we pardon something that we don't believe our our Lord uh God is pardoning do you know what i mean um um-hum yeah i can go along with that i just wish we could get get uh debate going here to get some verbal usage for the computer uh i have a brother-in-law that is strictly opposed to it and uh he is a uh very liberal uh believer in uh probation uh and convicts not being sent to prison but being sent to uh halfway houses  kids uh no i don't i don't are you are you married no no i'm in i'm in college i'm just a sophomore in college are you well um do you know what we're um suppose to talk about is is families and stuff like that and um how how you oh okay how you spend time with you're family and stuff uh i've got three kids uh-huh have you yeah so and i stay home with them so it's um i spend a lot of time with my kids i really enjoy it i uh that's great i've uh i i was in college for you know four years and and worked for a number of years and and now we've got three preschoolers so i spend a lot of time with them and yeah um-hum oh that's great how old are they um i've got a six month old a uh two and a half almost three year old going on thirty and then a uh four and a half year old almost five year old so i've got a couple a couple of little ones but um um-hum uh-huh yeah i i spend a lot of time with my kids um yeah it's that's great uh i i really am glad that that i'm able to stay home with them and stuff so it's real fun but well um do you uh yeah that must nice hum oh okay well how would you spend time with your kids if you were if you had kids or or uh do you do you do any babysitting do you did you use to when you were in uh high school or anything oh yes i baby sat all the time for uh for my last year in high school my full time job was going over to a a neighbor's house and babysitting their children until they got home every day and uh so what'd you do with them did you i mean of course you were paid to uh to spend time with them and stuff but what did you do to uh entertain them and keep them entertained were they older kids or school age right they were they were seven and nine years old both boys so we played we we did stuff like play softball and frisbee and that kind of thing and yeah yeah sort i sort of watched them you know ride their bikes and that kind of thing yeah yeah they were outdoorsy types yeah we my kids well my kids are of course now that it's getting warmer much more outdoors than than indoors but right shoot they can sit and work puzzles and read books for a long time so that's kind of and they did they pretty much they entertain themselves when i need them to but right right well that's nice i spend a lot of time i spend a lot of time with them reading and we play games and stuff but well that's good yeah but it's it's it's neat cause they're really they're they're well behaved kids and they're and they they interact pretty well with adults they're shy at times but they interact pretty well with adults and uh-huh none of them have started school yet uh i have my oldest goes to preschool two days a week and my my little girl goes one day one of the same days so um oh really yeah and then my little boy will start kindergarten next year so we went and checked out the school last last week in fact they had an open house and stuff so really yeah that's an adventure i think it's gonna be harder on mom than it's than it is on him but you know it's like oh i can't send my baby to school it's just yeah it's like i can't believe i you know he's he's he'll be five in in July and it's just hard to believe that you know time has has flown by so quick so yeah uh-huh oh yeah so i don't know it's it's they're pretty fun they're they're good kids so yeah well uh what are you majoring in in college well that's that's great i'm i'm in physics in physics yeah well you won't you won't deal much with kids in that area oh no i don't think i'll be out of school for a long long time no oh i know it seems like forever and i think uh i i don't know my husband you know wants to go back for um some uh master degree and stuff and i just think uh-huh oh i just not into that right now maybe in a couple of years i you know i might want to do that but it's i don't know i i was glad to have gotten out so oh yeah i will be too yeah that was uh i enjoyed my time but you know met my husband and met him there so it was uh yeah yeah a a nice nice sideline of it so that was good but uh yeah well what else about kids how do you think people spend time with their kids do you have any idea um not really my uh my parents are divorced and my father uh is dating a woman who has a two year old boy and uh kind of different huh yeah it is real different but they go they just went to Disney World he was in Florida so they just went to Disney World this weekend and they they do some fun stuff together go to the zoo and that kind of thing yeah uh-huh yeah we go we went to the zoo Saturday as a matter of fact yeah it's an adventure with three kids i mean it's it's fun but you i mean with three of them really i bet two's pretty easy  hello Ann hello Chuck um the other day i attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling um-hum and uh i was kind of interested to hear because they had some people from the EPA and lots of different places um-hum and uh they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste um i didn't think that was a new revelation well it's not too new right so what what is is the EPA recommending now oh they really didn't propose any solutions actually they were the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the EPA um-hum but he had a lot of uh facts to to give and things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and and uh uh one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of of news print and he was talking about um the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print yeah and they could sell it for a while they were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away why that's a that's a common problem now that seems that has happened in Dallas as well as New York and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either i suppose yeah we're doing some here in in Cash Valley the community here there's uh um-hum we've actually got a kind of a nice set up we've got a couple of plants here that actually take uh recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard and make it into insulation right and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them because they're actually buying it and shipping it in from outside well that's good so one of the real keys it sounds like to getting recycling for uh paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you've collected it right there has to be a a reuse for it i mean that's why they recycle the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that uh the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers uh everything from uh waste baskets to carpet to the no stick i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet and uh um-hum i think they're even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled like the recycled plastic Coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that and there's a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government one was like environmental protection and the other one was oh i can't remember what but the basic idea it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff we are putting into our landfill um-hum and uh the solution that he came up with for plastics and it was really quite amazing because he says well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them oh really he came to the conclusion plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's it's low weight but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space right and there's almost no energy there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling but there's a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it to produce electricity so his solution was to burn plastic collect it and burn it huh well it's carbon so that makes sense like a carbon fuel of some sort but what yeah and it's more than even paper or something like that there's more energy in it per pound or whatever what about emissions well that was he didn't deal with that he just said burn it he didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that so it's not very practical is it oh okay no well that's interesting i bet that was a good day at the uh conference then yeah well real interesting did it change anything for you um not too much i'm uh i got a bit actually  uh no this elderly care of the elderly i am looking at this right now with my father and it is a tough decision to make um-hum that uh does he he live at home now and yes he's and he's living at home more or less alone my sister spends an awful low of time with with him which is a burden on her um-hum yeah and his health is so bad that we don't feel right about you know just letting him do what he wants to do and of course he feels like he is capable of taking care of himself and we know better no i know my uh my mother uh my grandmother is still alive and uh feisty old old lady she's uh she's really pretty good but she really just can't get around any more and she does have significant significant health problems uh-huh uh-huh and my mom is looking after after her and it it's a big drain on my mom i can tell when i get calls from her she she sounds worn out yeah uh and uh it's tough on on my grandmother because she's use to just going to the store and getting what she wants and baking up things for her friends but now she's no longer where she grew up her friends have all passed on or in another city she can't just run right out and get things so a lot of these thing uh-huh fall on my mom go to the store get me this i want to go do that uh i've changed my mind phone calls in the middle of the night because she's lonesome yeah oh yeah Yeah yeah and uh you know i i can see from a distance i'm not right there on top of it maybe i am a little more objective but i would think that they would try like to try and find her some place that first of all she could be happy well that's that will be a problem because i have looked and they all really amount to the same thing uh yeah yeah i have looked for all both ends of the scale really from your kind of State run things to the very private elite type and really it boil down to i think to one thing you're putting somebody in there and more or less waiting for them to die um and it's uh it's sad but that's the way we've been brought up to look at it and i hate it but there comes a time when when this is what what happens especially with the way medicine is today It's keeping us alive longer and yeah and we're living longer so therefore you know you almost like to have some place that's almost hospice care but a little bit more independent than that almost almost like a community that has partly something like condominiums right yeah it's kind of our where those people that are mobile can still retain their their independence but maybe have somebody come by and check on them once or twice a day bring them the groceries or come by and chat or whatever and then a hospice for those who no longer quite so mobile right uh-huh the problem with everything else in health care is is the cost the cost is just unreal uh i mean that's that's almost why some of the you know the the experimental cooperatives you hear about where people sort of throw in all their money together and and do that sort of thing but it's it's you you start getting commercialization of it and the cost just skyrockets right well that's so they want to really make a a method of it i wish that we could find some place for for my grandmother she would be happier uh-huh uh and my mother wouldn't have to drop everything and and really she's lost a great deal of control of her life to the point where her own health is deteriorating right right and and that the stress is just enormous i i feel for you you're you're one step closer than i am to it and it must be it must be really draining on you well it is especially since he lives in Mississippi i live in Texas and then my sister lives in Louisiana This this you know it makes in fact i just got back from having to go stay with him because she needed to get away oh um-hum yeah and it's uh but uh i don't know what other solution there is eventually we're going to have to put him in a home some place oh it it right now though he's independent enough to to take care of day to day or or have well more or less but he is almost to the point that he's legally blind so that is really what bothers us uh he could start a fire uh just about anything could happen oh oh yeah oh yeah yeah i can i can appreciate that and there's there use to be programs in some of the more progressive communities of of house mates uh-huh somebody that comes and lives there and for room and board takes care of people but right you need you need a contact service in the community i'd i'd even be happy just uh trying to find a a day program that my grandmother would be willing to accept that she could go and spend the day meeting some right now she tries to hold up in her apartment and the only people she right  okay i guess we're talking about exercise huh okay yeah yeah well first of all i i have have to ask you how how old you are oh i am twenty seven twenty seven okay yeah well i am quite a bit older than you are but no i i think exercise is extremely important and i i do exercise on a regular basis you do what type of exercise do you do well i do um jazzercise which is an aerobic um oh you do program that are you familiar with it yes it's uh you know a national company and we have a jazzercise center here in Plano that has classes like all day long so you can is that different from aerobics or is it the same thing no it's really it's it's an aerobic routine you you warm up and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting you know slowly and then working up to uh you know a high heart rate and then you gradually go down again and you do that every day no i only do it probably two or three times a week oh okay the minimum they want you to do is three times a week oh and this is a club or uh do you belong to a group well it's really a i mean it's called a center and you buy as many classes as you want to a time and then you just go in whenever you can so like i usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings do you go with friends or do you go alone no i go by myself and and that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me yeah and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise or they might play tennis uh-huh and since i am not a tennis player um you know i don't get that but i am you know i am between i am in my late forties so um there aren't many people you know that want to do that most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers um-hum oh you know with with children between the ages oh yeah young mothers or yeah young mothers you know young women with with small children are the ones that i find well what do you do uh-huh uh-huh uh i really don't have a routine i like playing basketball we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop and that's what i do everyday oh great yeah so you play everyday yeah pretty much when my wife let's me well now who do you play with do you have friends that play with you or just you know no i just shoot around by myself yeah and uh that's about it i use to play soccer a lot in high school but when i graduated i haven't done much i don't have a problem i know i have to do more aerobics but i don't have a problem with weight i could eat all day and not gain an ounce well see that's that's that's really good and i think that keeps a lot some people from exercising uh-huh i mean i don't have a problem with weight either but i think i don't have a problem because i exercise you know i mean people are always saying to me how do you stay thin and it's because i exercise but i also watch what i eat you do exercises you do exercise uh-huh you know but you'll come being being twenty seven you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet but as you get older you will yeah and i well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days but i don't know well it might not it might not because everybody's been telling me that too and so far it hasn't happened you know and i i just feel like you know you have to constantly weigh yourself uh-huh and just keep an eye on it and cut back if it starts to get you know too high yeah i guess i enjoy sports a lot so that's why i've kept active in that way yeah but you don't play any other sports but basketball uh basketball volleyball um just about it just not really heavy just as far as recreation or hobby i do that but do you ski being in Utah i was wondering if you skied um i used to but it got too expensive so oh did it really yeah because i know that skiing in Utah is is suppose to be great yeah a lot of people do that yeah and but well i just i never find the time i had rather do other things yeah well i have never skied before but i have friends that go to Utah all the time and they think it's really and they ski i guess there's a place where you can ski where was it Tahoe where you ski from oh they come up here no that's Nevada to California i guess yeah i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line that's in Nevada uh-huh oh yeah but but there's a funny there is a place in Utah called a funny name there's Snow Bird or Alta but it's like oh Heavenly is that it Heavenly yeah i think it's called Heavenly huh i've never heard of that one huh-uh you've never heard of that well maybe it isn't in Utah i don't know but they said they've skied Heavenly and it sounded like you know that they skied really well and when they are actually talking about a place it was kind of funny do they exercise much or i mean for skiing i know when i went you can get sore easily but oh yeah you can get really sore i know you i can mean i've talked to people but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore oh yeah see i'm this one or two timer a year if i do go and i am really sore after and and then is it your your quadriceps that are this worst you mean your legs and yeah my legs really really ache yeah but that's i am using muscles that i have never used before yeah well and it's strange that like you can do like i did aerobics you know all the time and then i went horseback riding and still i was so sore and i couldn't get over  okay go ahead uh well you know um i think public service is a worthy thing and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs uh such as Peace Corps that promote that um-hum probably the most popular one but uh one that is not typically recognized as such is the Boy Scouts um-hum uh i know that from because my son is a a scout now and uh is thinking about his Eagle and uh in order to get Eagle you have to have merit badges in um citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world right and you have to do a public service project um-hum uh in which leadership is the key element i um i think the question is posed somewhat strangely because um it's talking about uh a requirement for public service um-hum uh and of course Peace the Peace Corps the Boy Scouts is a is a voluntary activity right uh i i think that might be talking referring to uh something kind of uh alternative to the draft you know either you have uh military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years right of course um uh military service falls under the category uh of a public service right right and so uh one of the things that would fulfill the at least the nominal uh qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft hm right right uh but i agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended there are other things such as civil service well you um-hum um which many people uh are lifelong employees of but i suspect that that's not what they had in mind either more of a voluntary kind of thing or uh right yeah i uh yeah it it for for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative uh public service for uh young people to go into uh after high school um it um-hum kind of in in lieu of the draft for people for people who don't uh who you know are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise wanna uh be in the military you know say okay well you can go into the military or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and and learn about things and it's it's it's interesting because i i'm not a particular fan of the military but i have seen a lot of people a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined you know even even just personal discipline about what they want to do and they come out and they they at least have now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more more discipline and they have uh you know in in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say they can see that you know if i do something pursue submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time i can accomplish a lot and it it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn that they don't need to be you know cowboys they don't need to be out there and uh you know constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished and you know for some for some young men that's good for me it would have been lousy idea idea uh because i i did have the the personal discipline and i went to college four years and got out you know so why why is that but um you know for some people that's good i i don't particular like the fact that it's the military you know and because the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially as as an instrument of US foreign policy oh no no no it's to defend the nation against external evils well that's one view and you know and that's that's another debate but uh it's um well it depends on whether you whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive aggression oriented military um-hum right right and just well it's it it seems pretty aggressive aggressive oriented i mean you you look at the last mission military action which was in the Persian Gulf and wasn't anywhere near the United States and it was um you know it was definitely a projection of US power on the other side of the globe so at at any rate this is getting off the topic but it my my point was that there is for people who don't want to do the military service there it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and um sense of community that do do i guess the Boy Scouts  hi okay do you work with a company that uh gives drug testing sort of i'm a i'm a student but uh i'm in the National Guard and they do a little bit of drug testing oh they do uh-huh what uh did they do that before you went in or what yeah uh they they do it before you go in and occasionally they'll have a a random urinalysis oh they will huh yeah so you can't be smoking marijuana in in the military anymore oh okay well i've i worked i don't work right now because my company i worked for PIE went bankrupt oh but um they was getting a program set up that for all new hires they was gonna drug uh give them drug tests oh but um they didn't hire very many new hires because all the people that usually work there you know just stayed there because it was they had been there for a long long time uh-huh but um actually i think they should do it yeah i i believe they should too you know um i don't think anybody needs anybody that's to be working for them that's on drugs of any kind you know uh-huh yeah definitely but uh i don't know whether i believe that they should just randomly do it i think they should kind of warn them like you know well we're going to do that or maybe tell them before they do get hired you know that this is what's gonna happen oh you and then if you don't like it why then you know you'll have to go look for a job someplace else uh but actually yeah you have to do it randomly otherwise people will cheat well i suppose you're right there too you know um yeah personally i they i know when i was doing my uh basic training in AIT there's guys who would fool around and then when that urinalysis came around they would be all scared so it does work it is effective uh-huh um-hum um-hum hum the only problem is you know if you have done drugs but you've stopped and uh you do get caught it is kind of kind of harsh um-hum well i suppose they fire you and everything right then huh or what do they do with you guys if that you guys get yeah uh we get counseling and uh i think part of our pay is docked if we're first time offenders oh i oh i see i really don't i i haven't been i don't do any drugs so i don't know yeah well i don't either i wouldn't even think about it i think anybody that does them are dumb dumb you know yeah really it's so stupid God they you can you just watch it on TV and see how it just crazy yeah yeah burns your brain completely up you know you don't know yeah wastes your future yeah really really dumb huh but um yeah uh see what else was i gonna say here uh what do you think about our uh like uh other government agencies testing do you think our government agencies should test yeah i think so i think they all should test really you know uh it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore yeah yeah that i don't know what's wrong with the people um but i think that the the government should do something about stopping it completely about it coming into our country uh you know they just slap somebody's little hand and you know well don't do that again and oh i know yeah they aren't and then they you you know they'll get out and they're right back at it again yeah right now it is it's too lucrative for the drug dealers so the the risks are worth it for them yeah um-hum um-hum but uh other than that why i don't know yeah like i say maybe one of these days i'll get a job because i am looking still for a part-time job you know since my company went bankrupt and i'll see what they do you know but like i say i i wouldn't care because i oh i don't smoke i don't even smoke so they can test me all i want i wonder what they'll do if you take medicine if that would affect it yeah oh see that's that is a problem sometimes some medicines will give off a a false positive yeah see now that i've heard of i've heard of that yeah that would be really unfair then huh you know yeah i i believe we should have the testing but they should be like if you get if you get a positive they should double check you and still give you the benefit of the doubt yeah find out what you know if you have been taking some kind of medication and you know if that would effect it and everything uh-huh yeah but um well i guess that's about all we can talk about i think our five minutes is about up anyhow well it was nice talking to you Rose okay Lewis maybe i'll talk to you again alrighty bye-bye bye okay bye-bye  hello Phil here in Rochester New York my goodness well i'm in Texas so i sound i found sound very Texan well this should be an easy one i so much so like we could we have lots to talk about well what what do you subscribe to or are you ready for me to press one and and let's continue our conversation yeah that would be all right okay hold on okay what what magazines do you prescribe to or do you have uh actually it would be easier to tell you what i don't get okay because i uh i receive Time Newsweek and the US News and World Report every week i get you know all the news magazines uh-huh and pretty much everything associated with my hobby which includes gardening magazines and uh uh uh radio and things like that so i i'm just loaded over here uh-huh well i'm not see i i i take Time and uh uh uh off and on during my life i've taken uh Good Housekeeping so there's i work so much and then when i'm not working then i'm active in i do i do not do the the enough reading like i should yeah i i since i'm in radio up here i have to try and stay informed with uh certainly what goes on around there i i like Newsweek better than i like Time i you know magazines for me i get behind but i like them because uh the especially with the news magazines you get much more analysis than the newspaper can give and uh i'm interested also in reading some of the stories that just aren't big enough to make into the local papers here right right and uh of course you know for gardening i i get Better Homes and Gardens up here mainly i get gardening information maybe some recipes and sometimes these things have coupons in them too right right and that more or less pays for your subscription uh-huh well i'm i'm very conservative so i don't jump uh i'm a single parent so i don't blow a lot of money in anywhere sure sure oh yeah it that's the thing you know they they have to be careful about which ones you get because they can be really expensive if you're right not careful not to mention finding the time to read them it's even hard for me i'd i have mail buckets full of magazines i haven't had a chance to look at yet right well see that uh i was really i was i do good to even get through excuse me i do good to get through Time sometimes yeah that i i i like Time a little bit uh i it's probably my second favorite of the news magazines well you think Newsweek might be a better uh i like Newsweek better uh because they have uh a couple of things i like they have the cartoons and the quotes in there which i think are funny and some of the stories you know they have the analysis like all the rest of them do but they also get some more offbeat stories huh uh-huh which uh i'm interested in finding out more about and it seems just to me to be a better read than Time Time is my second favorite uh-huh uh Time excels at the coverage of in-depth issues you know if you want to really find out something in-depth and learn about it Time is a good magazine right well what about what in your i'm asking all uh i uh uh really different question in a way but since you are in the in the public what is what does your area feel about abortion do you do is there any and U S general consensus or well i i kind of fall down in to the choice category just because really as a man i really you know i don't particularly believe that i have a particular say over what someone else some woman has or you know she has her choice to do right well we won't fight over this because you know i me myself i don't know that i'm forty six i don't know that i ever could have or ever would have an abortion uh-huh but now at forty six let me tell you one thing i'd have an abortion if i were to become pregnant but don't intend to you know but uh you know just just leave my body alone i have my choices yeah uh-huh yeah that and uh and i feel i really you know i don't believe in in getting pregnant when if there's any way to prevent it but it happens all the time you know i have a a sister-in-law that had her tubes tied nine years ago uh-huh before she had her little bouncing baby boy sure you know so there's things like that happen of course now they they didn't she wouldn't consider an abortion but they didn't intend for that third child you know intend to have that third child uh-huh but uh you know just uh i've seen Jane Fonda i've i watch very little T V also but i've seen Jane Fonda on T V at my mother's house and she said tells you she's telling the government to stay out of her womb and i feel that way you know you've got enough business you've got enough problems you've got enough fraud you've got enough uh you know  okay let's see do you live uh do you live in a neighborhood that uh has been affected recently by any uh crimes uh let me see not recently i we're Framingham is uh midway between Boston and Worcester and it's mostly mostly in Boston that we're finding a lot of problems um basically it's lined up blacks versus whites and there've been a lot of murders and mostly boyfriend girlfriend type of thing yeah we uh in Portland is is pretty uh how shall i say it they have a lot of problems but the problems are confined confined to low income neighborhoods well i shouldn't say low income neighborhoods uh neighborhoods where a lot of low income families live and and uh where there's lot a lot of drug and uh broken families and things like that um-hum uh that doesn't i i try to uh in my thinking to keep from blaming it on the on the nationality of people and more blame it on the culture of the uh you know broken families and and uh drugs and things like that right i think drugs plays a really big part a lot of times it doesn't come out in the paper or on the news um you know they're more into as far as the news reporters into oh you know two black guys killed each other or they knifed each other other to death and we have a lot with uh gang problems yes the gang problems yeah that the the problem that seems to be the major thing and we just recently with all the problems that there are in Boston we did have i was thinking we did have one crime in Framingham where a girl picked up a guy at a bar and uh her kids woke up she brought him home and her kids woke up and she was dead she had been knifed to death oh my goodness and he was a homeless person but why anybody would want to bring somebody like that home you know too many hormones huh really i think that was the the major part of it too much alcohol and she just invited him in and he waited until she was sleeping and then let her have it too much alcohol yeah just kind of a psychopath um-hum the the crime problem is uh i don't know if if you're this is uh about a four hour topic but a five minute uh window here so the for me i feel very bad about uh the people that are affected uh the people in the crime ridden areas are more innocent in some cases uh than the than the press finds well what i'm really trying to say is they are working class people who work very hard and are seriously affected by that and uh so even though i see um-hum right um-hum uh how shall i say it uh the problems of crime affect the black working class and uh minority working people um-hum much worse than they affect me uh so the the crime problem has to be solved one of the problems that i see is that and they always compare uh America they say well in America we have uh you know a gun problem and uh uh that i i read a discussion once of of uh the reason why England for instance uh has their gun problems and other problems are so low and it basically boils down to they don't have the Bill of Rights doesn't exit for those guys if you are standing at a corner and somebody and the Bobby walks up to you and he says you've been standing here four buses have gone by uh you're a pickpocket empty your pockets if he finds some things in in there then they will proceed to your house perhaps and uh say open your door up and go in and search your house and after that they can enter at any time hm now that has the advantage of uh weeding out how shall i say it of getting rid of the dandelions before they've before they uh populate your lawn right but it it just doesn't function in our court system over here we we won't allow you to be uh frisked by a cop uh without good reason yeah i think that's wrong i think that's where the law has got to change because they've found uh how many people have we read about or heard about in the national news that have been picked up and because of a technicality they're left let off yeah an actually you know and that's really not right and then they go out and do it again you know that's right and and like i my earlier example uh uh i could spend every day all day just picking the heads off of dandelions uh once i let my lawn get infested um-hum right uh  so um how do you feel about the crime in your city is it uh well um Minneapolis isn't too bad um i know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders um um-hum that's kind of gone up in scale and and some other things um i personally had a little experience the other day uh somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck oh really but actually you know when you look at at Minneapolis as compared to where i used to live it's really quite a bit better um because i came from Florida uh-huh and in Orlando there's crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever oh yeah um San Jose California so what part of California are you from oh really i have a good friend there here you know the real problems are the gangs a lot of gang related a lot of murders um just in general the whole we've only been here a couple of years uh before that we lived in Colorado but in comparison to Colorado it's real noticeable yeah oh yeah um-hum i mean you can just feel i mean i can just sense i mean i won't even i won't go to the grocery store at night yeah yeah that's you know and it it's that kind of thing and uh that's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like yeah we have a neighborhood watch program in the house um the development that we live in which i think is a great way to reduce um home theft burglary and things of that sort do you have that where you live or sure well um interestingly enough right before i moved up here i'm an intern and then i go back down in May um-hum um but in Orlando before i moved up we had a real problem with it um we've been broken into in my apartment about four times oh no in like two and a half weeks and one of the things that i i helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation down there um um-hum because they were just it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because everybody went to work you know and then the houses were left unguarded um-hum um but yeah i think given that people are pretty conscientious about it that's a good way to to work it with a neighborhood watch yeah well you know um also i've heard that uh the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home oh is that right like on the weekends a high percentage of uh free time i think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is uh spent doing yard work oh outdoors so they wait while you're outsides outdoors they know the house is unlocked and then they just slip in that's amazing slip in slip out you know they know exactly what they're going for so i've heard that's really on the rise as far as um you know a new type of crime yeah huh yeah it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter really you know yeah unfortunately yes yeah unfortunately it's starting to really you know look at people's habits and where they are at particular points of the day um-hum yeah like one of the guys i work with really laughs when he looks at Minneapolis because he's from Detroit uh-huh and uh the the crime level there of course is quite a bit quite a bit uh more pronounced um-hum um but uh yeah i guess i mean i think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in Minneapolis i'm not real sure uh yeah it helps to know your neighbors you know they give you you're supposed to make lists of um cars like i know a lot of my neighbors right around my development if i see a car that's unfamiliar we we have a list is that what you you did in your program where you have a list of license plates yeah pretty much yeah i was i was basically involved in that in the organization of it and then i left right in the middle of it i'm not sure where we went from there but um-hum oh uh-huh yeah well yeah that that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings noticing people who look suspicious uh activities like that sure um-hum i mean you you hate to be paranoid but there are really only so many things you can do you can have the house alarm um neighborhood watch program yeah you know uh as a woman not go out at night um you can do that which is what i choose to do yeah yeah one of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited even even if you know that the threat is there it's against the law to set traps yeah um-hum it's against the law to do a lot of things you know they could basically um when i was getting robbed down in Florida i was really considering electrifying doors um things like that like they did in Miami that time um-hum that's um-hum but it's not um if you kill someone in your home as long as they're in your home it's considered self-defense though that's not always true it isn't no there was a there was a case about two years ago um-hum where a guy knew he was gonna get robbed and essentially what he had done is set a a electrocution a electrocution trap um-hum for the burglar in his own home the guy came in while he was home hm and sure enough he fell into the trap and was severely burned he didn't die but he was severely burned and he took the guy to court and won a settlement really yeah so that really that makes you think you know it's like your hands are really very much tied yeah yeah well i think if if you had handgun a handgun though in other words it wasn't premeditated you had a handgun it's the middle of the night someone's downstairs  hi uh um hi i i should say something uh-huh that i'm the uh least informed this is totally accidental that i have to talk about this topic but it's i'm the least informed person in the whole United States this has not been determined yet but i i i've never read a newspaper in my entire life and i've i i never watch TV news nor listen to the news on the radio unless i'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before i can turn it off but any particular reason well no i i've i've explored that with lots of people uh they've tried to lock me up and uh things like that but um um i'm basically not interested and i also find the um everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and misguided and off the um um what am i trying to say uh i do learn about things largely largely from friends and i occasionally will read something like the New York Review Of Books you know someone will write a book about something and then i'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier uh-huh uh-huh but it and somehow and anything i participated in or know about when i read about it in the paper is always so uh covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that i don't have much confidence in it but i mean i don't think it's just that i'm lazy i really don't i mean i i like to refer to this as sort of Consumer Report phenomenon which is everybody that i know uh-huh reads Consumer Reports so the people who do feel that Consumer Reports does a a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest but assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas uh-huh uh-huh uh without thinking that there were people in who think each other areas area of of specialty and uh i guess you could explain it two ways and and the cynical view is well these things aren't doing a very good job at all and the view that i'd rather take is that uh-huh there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or uh particularly interested in buying something as a you know as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things right yeah and i think the same thing is true with news if you want to just have an idea as to what's going on most papers and and especially the better papers the the Times the Wall Street Journal the Washington Post give you a reasonable idea uh-huh yeah if you were deeply involved in it then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know that much right doesn't want let me ask by the way just for the record i i'm i totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them so i mean i'm not being elitist in that sense i hope uh well i mean there's there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things yeah what and most people think it is and i can i can you know accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it yeah by the way when you say most people think it is i think it's like ninety nine point ninety nine think it is percent i don't think it's that high i know a lot of people who may watch the TV news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper but you don't right and i think they're saying well if something's really important i'll at least find out that it happened yeah and and that's a that's is a reasonable start and for awhile i didn't read a newspaper when i came out here because i didn't find one that i liked um and if something important happened it was covered on TV and i could then go and and pick up newspapers if if it were important enough to read about uh-huh and i imagine you get the same level of thing that if somethings that you cared about happened you'd find out from friends or other channels yeah uh i did on the uh the Supreme Court hearings uh the for um uh the whole business of uh see i i actually have a a Clarence Thomas or yeah the Thomas and Anita Hill business i i mean that's that's the closest thing i deeply cared about that um right uh-huh and i sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine and when i arrived at her house she was engrossed in that we ended up watching it for a couple of hours zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and eating watching it some more and i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on but even then i didn't end up doing it on my own um uh yeah i stayed as far away from those as i could i decided i didn't want to waste the time i had i guess five years ago now wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings and afterwards decided that uh-huh right right yeah what i had gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time i put in and that these things are just very slow ways of seeing information come out think uh-huh yeah do you ever read  did women uh have the more variety in this area right oh i suppose i uh substitute teach in our public schools and what i find out nowadays is people are wearing jeans and and very casual things Polo shirts uh i'm of the opinion that i'm not one of the kids and i want them to know that so i'll dress a little more formally i mean not a business suit but you know a nice skirt and blouse or are you saying that the children that the students uh teachers are wearing jeans well i i should clarify i work in the i'm an artist and i work in the art department so perhaps they are a little more Bohemian but yes yes teachers are wearing jeans and they're wearing sneakers and kind of upsets me because uh it seems that they're getting treated as if they're sloppy and i i like the kids treated as if they're sloppy or treated as if they're uh peers as if if if the whole situation is too casual i don't get think they get the same respect as if they distance themselves in their behavior from the kids and i think the way they dress says a lot about their attitude um-hum i think they're too casual with the kids and the kids kids curse in front of them and ooh and and take too many liberties and i think uh-huh uh you know as much as i'm there to be their uh to be there for them but i'm not their friend i'm there to teach them something and it's it's business and it's serious and right of course motivation is everything and i suppose you're striving for intimacy on a intellectual level it's really hard to figure out how you're going to do that but of course we're trying to talk about dress and not teaching well i i think i'm talking about dressing how it conveys a uh a sense of um casual behavior and you know and and where it goes from there it's just a tangent of the same subject um-hum well i am in a much more conventional position i work as a uh white collar worker uh i'm a senior principal scientist at SRI International uh work with uh-huh what is is uh your particular field speech technology teaching computers teaching computers how to understand the speech huh oh so you must be very interested in uh Texas Instruments but anyway get off the subject in Texas Instruments oh yeah i actually used i used to be chief speech scientist at Texas Instruments oh i see so i i guess you're in a business suit all the time no actually i try to stay behind the scenes which means i wear slacks and uh oh my own personal style and it's it's variable and there there are a lot of people that'll wear jeans but i say probably most people uh wear dresses or slacks and um wear the men wear uh um probably most of them wear long sleeve shirts without ties uh it's interesting it's sort of silly and ironic not ironic but it's silly in in a sense that hm on visitor days which is are quite frequently people quite frequently dress up and they wear ties and coats and uh on non visitor days people dress down and they wear just slacks and dress shirts uh-huh it it well i guess it's silly in that the point is to be there and do quality work and not wonder about what you're wearing too much right and and it it's uh it's not one of my dressing is not one of my main obsessions or preoccupations what uh no i can see how you'd say that i'm not heavily into uh what's in this year or what's out this year i usually i have a certain amount of money that i spend on clothing and i buy things that will last year after year and um well i i buy a new shirt once a year whether i need it or not oh do you so i guess you've got a collection don't you well i don't pay much attention to it uh-huh well i don't know um now this this question did it relate to work or did it relate to to uh whatever i think it was just um clothing and how you feel about it and do you change your wardrobe from season to season um i guess the warmer it gets the less clothing i wear but i don't know that i i change my sense of color or style to to match a season but i do know people who have told me that the different carpets come out and different colors come out because uh the seasons change your mood and and your ideas of color and fashion change with uh hm uh you know with your mood and i guess it's all kinds of poetic uh i guess i'm a typical oblivious male in that respect i've met males that aren't terribly oblivious to clothing it's uh i said typical oh okay well some guys seem to think it's a shortcoming being too involved in their clothing like they have deeper more meaningful things  um why don't you go ahead first okay um short term uh it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over so budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much uh sure extra to go around uh long term is something we're starting to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about uh gee she's eight now so i guess about ten years good heavens um-hum so we're we're starting to think about long term considerations college and retirement but with not a whole lot of discretionary money it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it sure how about you that's kind of uh similar to what we're doing is um budgeting you know month to month is uh kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra so that's kind of how we do it uh from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever um-hum um long term that's a little bit easier for us because uh with uh our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings 401K plans um-hum um that kind of you know retirement plans that kind of stuff so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see versus when it's on the paycheck and you have to try and take out some of that money you always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month so right uh long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because um it's automatically taken out so uh that works out much better for us so that's kind of how we do it anyway but and the old uh if you can't see it then you can't spend it uh idea exactly exactly and if you can't touch it you can't spend it either so that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that you know you touch it you're going to get a penalty that kind of thing so it leads you to kind of say well i'm not going to take it out i'm going to keep it and uh keep it in there and let it grow so that some way maybe for retirement you're going to have that money left let's hope anyway so you'll have that so right that's kind of how we do it but ours is more like month to month too uh short term is to get things going so any way other than that uh is kind of how we do it so i don't know if we're our time is up or what they'll let us know um-hum um they'll uh yeah exactly we we actually do have some money in a 401K i just uh-huh wish i could afford to uh put more away each week because i agree that it's a an excellent way oh definitely definitely and uh it grows uh it it seems like at first you're not gonna see a big return but as the years go on if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better and uh so you know you just have to kind of look at it that way and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do automatic you know deposit from checks to where you don't see it right and uh you know exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent yeah it's put into our savings account and we don't see it then it works out to where you know you don't look at it you just look at the checking account and say this is what we have for money and that's it so yeah checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be i'm convinced yeah it it's easy because you do spend it that's for sure like i said you know you kind of look at it uh you you better have some other way of uh savings otherwise uh checking accounts aren't the best for you know long term type of planning so and you don't get a good return on it anyway so other yeah i guess there other than things like the stock market or mutual funds there's really not much of a return on anything these days exactly right now yeah it's a bad time you know yeah the interest is so low i mean it it's nice for people buying homes but for older people who have money in CDs or whatever it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever um-hum um-hum exactly exactly you know we have some in-laws uh that uh had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and uh kind of took them out of that because they got so low but uh yeah it's it drops so your better bet is to uh try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of uh savings plan or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing so yeah i'm i'm with a small company now and i hope that uh if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing that'll be very nice sure oh that's great yeah okay well i guess we're kind of running out of steam on this topic here yeah exactly  okay well i say the uh probably the best thing to do is is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water if they sink they're innocent right i see uh a good a good southern solution yeah uh so uh how do you how do you feel that's that's of course being facetious but yeah uh-huh you have to say that um i don't know the the things they asked to talk about were whether the uh whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing and seems to me that that's i think that's the way it's done now uh at least um-hum my understanding of the law which isn't very good uh uh-huh it seems to me that the judge does it and i i think that's probably all right in that they you know maybe know what the the norm is for a particular thing um-hum and i guess also what the system will absorb right they're probably more tuned in to that possibly though on um capital cases like maybe the death penalty uh-huh uh i'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole i mean he could have like a personal prejudice you know judges are people like everybody else even though they're they're supposed to be impartial but that's right maybe uh and i think that may i that may be an exception as well because i think that doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than than the judge i i think that's i think that's the way it is uh whether they they decide whether or not they uh yeah uh accused or whatever would get the uh get the death penalty do they have a death penalty in California yes in fact they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month and uh yeah um-hum there's a big uproar going on right now uh the uh Governor you know has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not yeah um-hum it was someone who had uh killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact yeah i something like that i've got no problem with them yeah um i guess the way i think about it is not it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge it's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people put it to sleep you know just get it out you know it's not able to fit in you know uh-huh something inexpensive yeah yeah exactly um i guess kind of the way i think about it also is they just if somebody gets the death penalty they're they're judged guilty they got the death penalty they should have one year and one appeal cover all their bases with one appeal and if not you know don't don't let them sit up there on death row for you know fifteen years yeah i think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years uh-huh but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and you'd hate to be one of those yeah that's a yeah oh i'm i'm sure yeah the other thing they asked about was whether uh uh the verdict should be required to be unanimous which again i think is the way it is now that all that all verdicts well maybe not i don't know at least in capital cases i'd think they'd have to be unanimous um-hum i i believe it is in capital i think in like uh lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six whatever uh-huh however many is on sitting on a jury i i believe that's the way it is but i'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases um yeah the paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial and that there's one juror that is is uh different than the other eleven uh-huh yeah and uh they've only deliberated four hours or something and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked oh no judge told them they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet i'm telling you go one way or the other that that's probably an expensive trial yeah six months so far they said so uh yeah probably yeah i'm i'm sure there's a number it's probably like thirty forty thousand dollars a day you know worth of all the food for all maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their uh vote yeah yeah that's that's been so long i've practically practically forgot who Noriega was you know right that has been going on my uh cousin is a FBI agent down in Miami oh really yeah so she follows that stuff pretty closely but uh yeah she's not involved in that that case that's interesting well have you ever served on a jury she doesn't no i haven't i never have my wife has but i i haven't uh-huh i got called but i uh never uh got selected for a jury i sat for twelve ten days in a court room while they went through the selection process and they had uh-huh uh-huh some guy that was uh defending himself oh  go ahead uh have you ever been tested for a new job or anything um no i haven't but in my job i'm a nurse and we are allowed to be i mean you know this is the rules that they can do this anytime uh i don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested so it's just sort of um they can if they they can if they choose to right yeah oh okay have you well what have you had any experience with it at all um not really but i've always worked on a university level but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff uh-huh and what do you think about that um i don't i don't think they're very accurate because i mean i know their lifestyles changed prior prior to the drug test and i know they changed afterwards right right see i know of that too and i also know that things like antihistamines Sudafed things like that can really throw it off and you cannot get a job because of it and they may not tell you the reason why yeah i i had a friend it didn't cause her any problems with her job but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen uh-huh but what it was was she had been using she had been um in the jungle and it was some Malaria medication and she tested positive for that see and so it really is a dangerous thing that way because i know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job and they weren't told why but a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing or they would tell you or this person never use any drugs see i always i thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more test but um you should because you should be given another chance or at least able to justify it or something i have real mixed feelings about it i don't know how uh do you know how wrong they are are they i mean is there a margin of error the accuracy i don't know i don't know but i know there are a lot of things that can influence them and i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time yeah and if you could show that i i interviewed for a job recently and i was taking Entex uh-huh and my doctor gave me a prescription for it and he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you you know and it didn't come up that i needed to do it but if this could happen to anybody and if they would just say oh this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them yeah you know then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything yeah and i i'm not so sure they're that needed i mean so i don't know yeah i'm not sure either the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it because they say they can spot check yeah if you're using it while at a job i can see a problem but the occasional person then it's almost like it's almost an infringement of your privacy yeah well it sort of is and this is it this i'm not real sure how i feel about it because i can see it from two ways you know as a health professional i wouldn't want somebody take care of me that was using drugs yeah you know so as a patient i feel well yeah we probably should be protected but on the other hand there's a lot of things i should be protected from it they don't test my patients for too so you know i guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way yeah you can't go around testing everybody for everything yeah so i don't know and i i think it could be used to hassle somebody if someone was out to get you i think that a company or a boss could use this you know they could keep on doing this to you or something i guess i can see where it could become a problem and it it's like it seems like now they have trests i guess they can test your hair and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago really oh wow but maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago so i know that's the other thing i mean a lot of a lot of people as kids or you know young people get into some things that they get out of later on and i don't think they should really have to pay for that forever yeah there's a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldn't do as an adult but so yeah you can't say it was wrong at the time i think that's true yeah yeah so that probably wouldn't be too good either  bye so we're um our discussion's about uh the care of the elderly that's right that's right you know what what uh what do you think is important if you were uh i don't know how how old you are but if you had if you had uh parents say or or or or like grandparents whatever it is uh who were ready who who who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for um well i actually my dad's my dad's almost ninety and he lives by himself and he's in good shape um hm yeah but um some friends of mine have um gone through this i think i'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and um where they did some things to try to keep them um mentally alive yeah and where there was um caring and compassionate where there were caring and compassionate people uh operating it do you have any experience with this yourself hm well my uh uh my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in uh Minnesota and we go there um-hum uh once a year we see we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston so we're pretty far away when we visit Minnesota though we go to see her and it seems um-hum um i mean the the environment there i don't know too much about it but it it seems nice enough uh it it's hard at least half of the residents i would say are not not mentally sound so it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to retain to retain um clarity say uh you know it from the lack of stimulation you mean yeah yeah well i i i don't i don't know we we also my wife and i uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that's just a mile from our house we um she goes more often than i we used to go maybe once a month or once every two months to visit some of the patients there and we'd take we have a two year old son and so we sometimes we'd take him with and uh there i would say it's the same thing it's a it's a nice uh is relatively nice environment but again um it must be depressing for the people who who are who who are just too old essentially essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but but certainly um certainly have are are are have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on it's must be depressing to to walk walk the halls and see and and see all these other people who really don't know where they are do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what you'd perceive of as genuine concern i think so yeah i think they're relatively respectful respectful yeah and and concerned that in as much as they can be i i think sometimes you know i've noticed uh people asking for uh some of the patients asking for things uh just repetitively and for things that are not reasonable and so at at some level the the the um um-hum yeah i'm sure that the that the uh the staff learn learn what's normal for this person so it looks to me like maybe they're not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just you know is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need you know yeah it it's possible i was thinking also that there'd be there could be a fair um burn out factor um in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are oh yeah sometimes depending on the person not gonna be what we would perceive of as rational needs yeah i'll tell you one thing though though that that i i saw saw that was really nice we saw husband and wife we used to see a husband and wife in there uh together and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were but these two were and when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house um-hum um-hum so it gives them a sense of identity and so you yeah you walked in there and it didn't look like uh you know how you you walk into some rooms and there's it's completely generic there's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person and that's it but this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that and they had all their stuff from their house and it looked like a it it it must have been it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them and it must also give them a sense of uh uh security and and uh and and you know security security uh yeah i i think part of what you're saying matches what i have have read i used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who um were adequately deficient in their abilities um physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves yeah but i also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because i think they provide um a lot of social activities hm yeah um the one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation um and hm oh that's what temporary i that that's that's new to me i well i think it i think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there and i feel like the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like like put her in there and there there's so much right right  what do you usually wear to work well let's see it turns out that uh Tektronix i work at Tektronix and it's a very uh low key place as far as dress goes you just wear uh let's see um-hum when i first came here i wore suits but after a while i got uh found out that that wasn't all that important i'm an engineer oh i see and uh so i get to wear just uh how shall i say it uh walking shoes as opposed to dress shoes and um-hum well walking how shall i say it kind of like Avia uh walking shoes uh well that's nice comfortable stuff yes open shirt open at the neck you know no tie and uh wow just uh reasonable looking how shall i say it uh sports clothes or well some guys wear some people even wear Levis wow that's nice now being from Philadelphia i don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed right well actually right now i'm a full time college student so my dress code is very very expensive yeah i usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime but over the summers i've had a job internships with the newspaper oh okay um-hum and that's so generally then i dress you know nicer usually nice summer slacks or more sometimes skirts stuff like that so then it's still you know the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and coming in out of the office but you still have to have a professional image kind of thing to go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that so yes yeah well i uh i just recently applied for a different job in the company here and oh really so i decided well i'd wear a suit and it it was very interesting uh like i said most of the people at at this company don't wear suits uh most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual almost the same clothes that that you'd wear to school um-hum wow that must be nice atmosphere then well it has been although the new president and CEO of the company is from a much more formal eastern uh background oh and so the result is that uh so anyway i wore this suit and i went over to uh uh to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it and it and um-hum i i was almost converted because uh the effect of that suit on the way people responded reacted and responded to me as opposed to the uh just to kind of how shall i say it they know you're there but they don't uh you don't there's no notice at all but when i wore a suit that day uh it was obvious that people didn't know whether i was a worker bee or a manager wow so people uh how shall i say it made a made much more effort to notice you acknowledge your presence say hello and uh things like that so that's interesting it's like a mini little study there that's really interesting yeah and so this dress for success thing i think is uh by and large i've i'm kind of uh convinced that uh by that just that one uh uh experience and then having talked to several other people that that uh unless you're in a an environment where they're going to make fun of of of better clothes that better clothes always pay off right hum that's interesting doesn't mean they have to be uh how shall i say it they they don't have to be the the most uh the absolute best um-hum but uh a little dressing a little bit above the standard i think would uh pay off so i'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again that's neat that's neat and uh i i don't know no i know eastern now the other thing we do here of course is a single not quite a single climate we have uh we do have some snow in the wintertime and it can be quite warm in the summertime not hot like uh i lived in the midwest for a while um-hum oh and i know that uh you know it can be freezing cold in the wintertime and and hot and uh sticky in the summertime um-hum we don't have that much it's uh it's a very mild climate oh well that's nice that's good for the clothes budget i would imagine because here yes it it is gosh we had uh the winter hasn't been bad this winter it's it it's only snowed maybe once or twice but it's been cold low twenties let's say and then the summer gets up to eighties nineties so  oh it it it's i i'm i'm not sure if if there's anything i really consider an invasion of privacy that happens happens regularly except maybe like telemarketers and things yeah i have the problem with the telemarketers over here we get we get all types we get the handicapped people calling up here you want to buy some light bulbs that's right yeah and uh if you don't want the light bulbs there's vitamins and if you don't want the vitamins there's the household cleaner pens no i've had i've we i just today was looking into an organization called Catholic War Veterans because they were bugging boy they they they're tugging on a few strings at once aren't they yeah they were uh bugging me for a donation earlier and i i you know i get these calls on one line just constantly every single organization yeah and you know you it's i've learned to hang up on them but sometimes it's not so easy yeah i i got some call last night i'm trying to remember oh this this was like this this is kind of an invasion of privacy where uh i went to a wedding expo because i'm getting married and uh there are like you know uh these places where they say you know sign sign up for a free whatever you know for for a drawing yeah and you do it and uh you know all of a sudden this guy is calling you and saying hi we want to call you know talk about video taping your wedding when shall we set a time up and i couldn't get the guy to get off the phone it's like how many at what what part of no didn't you understand you know well it's the same thing with these oil well people what do you mean you don't want to get rich The other thing that i i think is amusing are with these long distance companies now we have MCI here yeah same here and uh they have their friends and family program and i love it you can call up on one of the lines the family right yeah they they fixed it so you had to give some information out but well there's another one the account balance line all you got to know is the person's zip code right and you can find out how they're paying their M C I bills and and on anyone you know all you got to do is cross reference a phone number with a zip code which isn't too difficult and you can learn all sorts of things and Sprint does the same thing and and yeah they i i think in general you know technology as nice as it is is causing a lot it's just too easy now to it's like you know Bay banks used to be you know you could do anything over the phone yeah you had to know your pin number but i could just i could just say to it empty my whole account out if i wanted transfer things and you know there there's a lot of of risk involved there because you know it it's like you know the best example is probably credit reports now huh where where you know God knows what goes on those things i mean thankfully thankfully now you can get your reports for free at least from TRW but it it it it's like it's it's this anonymous thing where anyone can dump any information they want about you in there with no real opportunity to rebut unless you want to go and get the report and then you know and then you you you find out you can go for a house or something all of a sudden you find out what all these people have been you know dumping information about you in there and i've heard of cases where it was just done vindictively yeah we had uh we got a report back in the mail as a matter of fact and found all sorts of problems with it mainly account numbers that have changed and they left both accounts showing as open yeah and uh some other one that claimed i didn't pay them and i did and then you have to try and get that company to take you off and they don't really want to bother and yeah yeah when i when i applied for my Gold MasterCard they said well you have to close this other MasterCard out too and i said you mean the one i closed two years ago and i had to get a letter from this other company saying that i had closed it oh yeah it's a pain in the neck because they you know they'll they'll believe these companies in a second over the individual yeah and getting proof for these people i mean it's not my job you're the one that screwed up and you know if you want to damage my credit rating that's fine but i will take whatever actions are appropriate to protect it um like lawsuit oh it it it's very slippery though because you know it's one of the things you do when you when you sign those little credit applications is there's all sorts of disclaimerage at the bottom about how you know you're permitting them to check do credit checks of you and to make your information available to other people and by the time you get through reading it you've basically permitted them to you know broadcast on the evening news your credit rating yeah i know i know it's just that consumer we need to have stronger consumer protection laws and we just don't seem to be able to get the government to do it right right well you know there's much more subtle kinds of invasions of privacy like every time you call an eight hundred number you're giving them your phone number oh yeah yeah i know i've been reading the Comp DCom Telecom all about it yeah we're we both probably signed up for this in the same place yeah i i contribute every once in a while in there and yeah i see the messages about the uh A N I A N I yeah but to some extent i'm not as worried about that because yeah you're you're getting a value for that you're getting to call these people for free yeah i uh you know the other boondoggle is this caller I D thing you know i don't mind caller I D one bit um-hum um if i don't want to use it or if someone calls me that i don't know who it is i can just not answer the phone yeah  okay how are you you want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget yes yeah well i i i i feel like um i am from Mars i mean i'm fifty years old and uh i've been divorced for um eighteen years but i've two kids and all but i uh i i've never had a budget and i don't uh i don't do any planning and i don't know i don't uh uh i don't have a long-term financial plan and i don't try to control my expenses but i'm i'm glad you're a stranger that sounds kind of like me but really i'm i'm in a happy i i well i'm curious how other people live uh so maybe we should start with you what do you do about the same thing yeah really oh maybe they're going to arrest us both i'm even even in worse shape because i have eight children and uh we live from hand to mouth we hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not then we try to due for the next month wow a couple a couple of times we've tried some things and they worked but i'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it uh-huh the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and uh took my check and divided it out into envelopes yeah and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope and when the envelope was empty then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area uh-huh and that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent uh-huh it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money and we did that pretty successfully for about three months and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do huh the um i had a part-time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy six and uh uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that and i actually did my bank account would uh i had i i kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month but i i had miscalculated i well i didn't keep a balance it's one of the problems i never had to in the past i always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when you're only earning half the salary even though i wasn't spending much money i sometimes would just things would get to tight uh and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet and every time i uh i spent money i mean cash mostly i would uh write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning uh-huh uh-huh but i would forget to write the things down and it it that i i don't know if i ever went as far as three months or not in in keeping that kind of data i certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever i even find now like with the automatic tellers i'll go take money out of that and then i forget to take that out of my checking account yeah uh-huh and uh yeah so i i i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account and i figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there uh-huh and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make uh-huh the uh i i i have to say that let's see at this point on i don't run out of money um and it uh and and i don't i mean someday if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i don't have and i i i i think my strategy if if i may is is is is to is to not spend money i mean i don't have expensive tastes i don't go out i mean i buy a car well the last car i got rid of i'd had it was nineteen years old people people were embarrassed for me i mean it was it was a good car and yeah it was still running oh it was great my my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty five Buick and it just wouldn't stop um and it i i just didn't feel the need for a new car it isn't like i couldn't afford one uh-huh uh and now i mean i i don't uh i tend to eat expensive food i mean i don't mind buying a good steak but for me i only do that every week or um without even i mean maybe once a month yeah i mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound you buy a a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars to me i realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that not very often but but i'm just i'm just saying as a single person that's that's a drop in the bucket and so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up if you're buying mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which i don't care to go to that's right so so that's i think one of the reasons i don't need to budget is that i don't have i don't i don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i can't afford it because i'm not interested in that expensive thing  what do you think uh are we spending the right amount of money on AIDS research well uh actually i'm i kind of uh well that's like between saying yes and no it uh i think that we're uh spending about what we should but i'm not exactly sure if we're spending it in the right right uh uh location yeah i i do believe that there i i'm like you i'm a little mixed up on the subject i think there are more people who die of heart disease in a year in this country than there are of AIDS is that true have you heard that yes and and i suppose really AIDS is you die from any number of things isn't that true true right so so i would suspect that you know pneumonia i think is one of them and and the cancers and whatnot so i think indirectly there there is extra AIDS research being done right um but i think that a lot of people have the attitude that the more money you throw at something the uh better chance you have at at curing it and that's just not true no i don't think so i i i totally agree it's just like education throwing more money into a grade school isn't necessarily going to make things better right i think uh you know that that money needs to be spent on on research but i i think uh you know it should be a a wide spectrum research of research and not just uh you know research on a cure and not not on a research on how to uh prolong life or or uh make the disease any any less traumatic know i think money i think one once somebody has contracted the disease that's that's uh you know that's unfortunate but let's try to concentrate on on you know let's put resources on making sure nobody else gets it yeah so i you're thinking in terms of of an education on how to prevent it or you're thinking of maybe uh i don't know a vaccine or uh right right well i think uh you know there's there's my opinion is there's there's a there is a limited number of resources medical resources available oh absolutely and i think it is foolish to to uh spend most of those uh a a large majority of those resources on people who have AIDS uh simply because they they uh they need attention right away or or need more attention than somebody who has heart disease or or slow cancer or something i think i don't know i think uh too much money is being spent on on uh on sophisticated medical treatment for for people for people who need to be in a hospice program yeah yeah well do you think that one reason maybe that the the funding level is as high as it is is because AIDS perhaps strikes uh a vocal group of people yes well that i mean that fits the country we live in the people i mean that's right tell me about it i was in i was on a down in downtown Washington Sunday when half a million people were demonstrating it oh okay yeah the i mean the the people with the loudest group voice get the money it's not necessarily the people who uh who deserve it the most yeah well i i agree that there's a limited it it's almost like we have fixed number of dollars that you can spend on medical research and you have to kind of allocate it in certain directions right although that sounds heartless that's that's but good things have come of that i mean polio is just about a thing of the past right and and other diseases um well i know just something local to you i remember i used to live in Dallas and so i have friends there and i know for example uh Parkland Hospital is spending or at least was when i was there spending a large portion of their budget their budget on on on basically warehousing AIDS victims uh-huh i suspect that's true and yeah that's you know i i you know my heart goes out to those people who who have the disease but i don't think that we should be spending uh you know that the that a majority of the hospitals resources should not go for for uh indigent AIDS patients that's right well certainly if you have AIDS unless you're incredibly wealthy you're going to end up indigent right i think that i mean that goes along with it too you get to the point where you can't work and  how many children do you have now well i have five you have five well you do have a hard time finding time then don't you right well five are i mean four of them are grown they're in college or just out of college so i really have just a thirteen year old at home um-hum you sound so young well i work at it i try to fool everybody uh-huh to have them uh i think you're doing a good job i just have one child and uh i don't think um well there's not much i can do about it my my wife and i are uh in our forties you know so uh uh-huh but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the they're the pivot point of the universe i think you're right because i was an only child too and that's one reason i have so many because i really i enjoyed the big family yeah and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters and so she's sort of like an only child and it's the same type of thing um um-hum i have a younger brother like that i'm in my forties like i say and i have a brother in his twenties and i was i was the youngest uh-huh yeah so i understand how that worked and he was treated like he had five fathers or something right that's exactly how it is you know she's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her when things don't go right she just calls one of them you know but um yeah yeah it's it's a little bit difficult though i think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and i was home more and did y'all do a lot of organized things like uh Little League uh soccer and we we really did not my next oldest daughter that's in college in California is a world twirling champion she twirls a baton and we did a lot of things together she and i did a lot of things together and flew we've flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform uh-huh um-hum and that was a lot of fun but that that i guess you could consider that organized i mean there's a competition all the time we were very heavy into that yeah other than that they were pretty much and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that you know i think that's probably true the if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities and if you have a large number of children or then you don't uh-huh well you can't afford to no you can't and there's not enough time um like my son is in uh Little League this year he's ten right and they practice three times a week and they have a game and it's just uh if there were more than one child i don't know there there would be no way to do it right that's right you know one parent go in one direction and i'd have to go in the other and uh-huh we could only cover two at that yeah well i know i spent hours in the gym everyday with my daughter and my little one also competed because really she had no choice she had to go with me um-hum so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and and competing and of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was it was making the friends and going all the places and it was a really neat experience but it took our total time i did not work um when i did this now i do work full time um-hum and it's just my thirteen year old and myself and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other i don't think although i think a a more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me but i'm not sure i could afford three i most certainly couldn't educate three i don't know how my my parents did it yeah i mean there were five of us i don't recall you know wanting anything in particular uh but i don't know how my father did it he worked at a truck line and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children but we did okay we had a house and a home and but now my wife and i both work and we don't i don't believe we have as much as my parents did and we only have one child really well things cost a lot more i don't know how it is in Georgia and i don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some um-hum um Atlanta's horrible yes have we have a lot of people moving here from Boston and and different areas and from talking to them they're shocked is it really what and they you know the housing so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it they sell their house they stash away a good bit of money right that's what i've heard and come down here and i work with a lot of them they they think they they've really done something then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous hm compared to to where they came from the housing's cheaper but that's about it yeah i'm surprised to hear that i've heard very positive things about Atlanta everybody  okay uh do you have any particular um ideas about our funding of AIDS research yes yes i think it's important that we uh either make a special tax for it or implement the money toward that away from other areas it's going to be such an amazing insurmountable insurmountable you can't even imagine the cost it's going to cost to take care of these people and and if they can find a resource of course they can cut the pain and suffering but if anything the cost they're going to save a well fortune just implementing that money toward that do you think it's more important than cancer or something else simply because the the numbers are so large yes i do oh well cancer the numbers are larger okay um however AIDS has the opportunity to become to become larger than cancer within a very quick time because my thought leads to you know i have uh school age kids um-hum uh i think a a a good amount of money ought to go to the education which they they doing seem to be doing um-hum i i agree uh because i think you want to stop it before it gets to you know it's not the kind of thing you can reverse if you've got to stop it before it starts um-hum something inside inside me upsets me to think that there're there're lots of diseases in in my husband's family there's a genetic disease um-hum why aren't people making a stink about that and you know and curing you know making this gung ho rally to cure that i think it's because the sheer numbers i really think it's that it's a scare also it is uh AIDS is a major topic right now it's trendy in the news it's in everybody's point of view but until you've really worked with it and seen it that's that's the difference it is it is oh i'm sure it's devastating and and there there is a real scare scare a real fear you don't know um-hum you know how dangerous it could be i had answered a uh job ad for we have a local VA hospital down here um-hum and they said they needed a lab assistant and i'm working part-time now i'm a substitute teacher right uh but you know i get called sporadically and they needed this lab assistance in the neighborhood and said you didn't have to have experience i'm really an artist but i figured oh you know i'll find out what it is and she she very casually said well think about whether you want to this because there are lab animals and blah blah blah and the um you might be exposed to AIDS in the animals but you know you'd have gloves and this and that and it did make me flinch it did make me not want to do that well i remember the first time i worked with an AIDS patient i was terrified i have to admit it and i know educationally wise everything i'm supposed to know imagine how they feel right and it still scared me sure but i get you know these these were lab animals i'm not crazy about rats to begin with i mean but here's humans and you can feel compassion for them that's true but you'd be surprised how many nurses don't oh i don't know it i'm not kidding i yeah i guess it people will do anything you know just because it's a job and they have to make a salary but i i work in a public a county hospital and uh well first of all most of those nurses there are LVNs because the pay is bad for them uh-huh and they don't they don't have many RNs and very few BSNs hm so the care is shoddy the care is shoddy yes uh the compassion is low the hours are long and there's a lot of people so they tend to isolate them and leave them for a large amount right yeah how can you feel when there's a sign on your door you know i is it huh there there's usually a sign on the door saying quarantined or something you know or yes they're in isolation sure they certainly are i'm sure a big part of it is uh they they suffer mentally as well as physically they definitely do they definitely do yeah you know it it just when i when i see a headline that says that we're giving twenty five billion to Russia because you know they need to eat better and then we've got so many problems at home i know and we our debt i i'm just so concerned what where is this you know my husband says well they're printing up more you know i don't know where where is it coming from do they ask us i know where are they spending it i know who who are i mean where are they spending this money you know well i don't know how we could spend it when we owe so much i don't understand me either you know you would think it balances you know you don't have it you can't spend it but we seem to it's a mystery um-hum yes we do yes we do uh so i guess you're saying you think we should spend more for AIDS research um i i'm not i don't really know what we are spending actually uh that's exactly what i was going to say i don't really know how much we're spending it may be one of those things that takes twenty years to find anyway or fifty well well i hate to think there's a you know it seems that anytime a bureaucracy works on something they waste a lot of money on administration costs oh i know and a study of how to do this can cost millions of dollars instead of just trying it right right uh i don't know um i imagine  well do you have any good ideas about this problem well i i i live in Fort Lauderdale now which is of course very close to Miami right in fact my fiance works in Miami uh downtown quite a bit so crime's a definite concern also before this i was in Boston where the crime rate's also fairly high uh-huh uh so it it's definitely a concern something that needs to be worked on i know that it affects my everyday life in that uh you know my fiance is very paranoid about making sure everything's locked right uh you know it it also concerns me because i have a convertible and uh you know there's certain areas around here where i'd be afraid to drive with my top down yeah well i have the same thing and i understand because i live very close to Dallas so we have quite a crime rate too but i'm not real sure what to do recently it's been kind of a topic at work and um i just kind of feel that there's a lot of people in jail for crimes that are not really against a person and i think maybe we need to find another way to punish those people and put the real criminals in jail where they really can't do any harm and not let them out on parole in six months or three years or whatever and put them to work doing something useful where they don't just eat up our tax dollars sure and that's kind of what we've come up with but i don't know what are your feelings about that well i mean yeah except the the problem with that of course is defining what what's a real crime then you know what what's a crime that counts right well a dangerous thing you know where you will get hurt if they're out on the streets i mean it i think this deal of Leona Helmsley has just kind of brought this all home and that's what kind of sparked the discussion was that this is a seventy seventy two year old lady gonna go use up tax dollars in jail and i just i just have a real problem with that i think there's another way to deal with that other than put this lady in jail to set an example but putting it that way that is kind of ironic that she'd be using up tax dollars but that's right uh you know that really is true sure uh however you know some of the crimes that people ought to be locked up for are uh are uh you know not even things that would be major crimes but they'd still be dangerous for example uh drunken driving well that's true well that is a potential danger though you're right about that but you know but um traffic tickets things like that i mean i've known of people just to be picked up because they didn't pay their traffic tickets and you know but i i say yeah fine them extra do whatever but to go ahead and put them in jail it costs us money when they do that so i don't know i just have a problem with overcrowded jails on crimes that nobody's really gonna get hurt uh financially maybe and and things like that and yes it has to be dealt with but i'm not sure that's the way well that that that is true that the uh amount of uh you know it it is true that uh you know jail as a concept at least is not working in some cases yeah you know uh yeah and also i think that they can get off on too many technicalities i think that it turns out sometimes that the victims are the ones that have to defend themselves rather than the criminals and i think that's another thing that needs to be addressed too i i think a i think you have much many rights as a victim sure i i i think it's very sad however uh you know i i i can see some of that in that and i still don't necessarily agree with that but i mean that the thing is that uh you know we're talking about affecting someone's you know livelihood sometimes their life even on some of the more heinous crimes right and uh uh it's a you know you according to the system we've got they're presumed innocent or get another trial um-hum you know so yeah they they do have to do some of that stuff although i do agree with you that it's that's another thing that's not quite right yeah i think so and i don't know i i've been through a two year divorce recently and i find that the system sucks to put it bluntly and so you know i just i don't have a lot of respect anymore for what i thought you know would be fair you just figure oh well the judge will be fair well forget it you know it's not it doesn't happen they're in a hurry their docket is full they want you in they want you out sure and that's the way it is and so my my fiance's a lawyer so i definitely understand that um-hum um-hum uh course in Florida the judges are elected so um not only are they not fair they try to be popular at times yeah you know which is not necessarily right yeah so i don't know but i don't know how you and i can solve this that's the problem you know we all have ideas but nothing seems to change and i'm not sure how it can well uh i i think you had a part of what we need to do earlier is uh  um well you know i i think it it really depends you know i think you know if if you know taking the current batch we've got you know i think Paul Tsongas probably isn't in it for like his own gain i i don't see him as that kind of a guy i can believe like that Bill Clinton might be um i certainly think a lot of people in Congress are well it's for me it's hard to talk about uh specifics because i don't know the people all i've read is uh the headlines the uh um-hum the generic question which is what they're talking about i think it's yeah all government any government is based on the honesty of the of the individual right yeah well you know i think i think if you like compare us to other governments you know i i think we tend to be overly critical of our own government i mean you go and look like a lot of these African countries where corruption is right right out in the open it's like you know you want to do something you know you better even be the president's best friend or you know pay me a lot of money yeah well that's that's part of it the tradition certainly modifies it if you have uh tradition of of um like baksheesh or whatever they call it yeah or might makes right or money and which is might right or bucks make right so uh in certainly you're not going to have the same kind of honesty on the other hand uh i i i think it seems to me that all the big scandals are based on either individual honesty uh going corrupt or frankly uh uh elective honesty going bad on us well you know i i think you know to some extent you know people get the government they deserve is a cliche yeah but it it's really true i mean if you know you hear these guy i think that this is the first election i've heard about where a lot of the incumbents are really finding saying okay we're getting out because it's too much heat i mean normally it's yeah okay what big scandal but it comes times to reelect them they say hey this is the guy that brings home the bacon for us you know he's got seniority on all these committees we're not gonna replace him yes and that's again the what you said earlier about people get what they deserve they say well if if if a dishonest person is uh good for us we'll keep him in office yeah and i mean also you know you look i think a lot of it has to do with reform with with with the issue of campaign reform when it costs you i mean ten million twenty million dollars sometimes i've heard horrendous figures to run for a Senate seat you know job pays a hundred thousand a year you know it it it the you work it out unless someone is incredibly altruistic you know there's no reason for them to want to run for that i i think that uh part of it again is this this uh well organizations can go bad and our particular organization has is one of the best in the world but it's still relative to itself is uh is in serious need of reform um i've i've been overseas and and there's a lot of as you pointed out there's a lot of corruption corruption in other countries and so when you come back to the States you say well as bad as this is i'm still awfully glad to be here uh so i guess the you know this this question was can we ever get uh totally uh honest government and i would say uh right it's an imperfect system because people are imperfect yeah only to the extent that i'm honest can i can i uh uh act as an honest person i i mean the problem is that you know you've got as i said there's no incentive incentive to go into i mean look at our state legislature and things where very nominal pay but there's also not you know what's the campaign the campaign is four guys go against each other and you know there's no advertising those people i can believe are doing it because they want to change the process but when you're talking about having to spend tens of millions of dollars to get elected and then being in the pockets of all these people who gave you the money and then having to regard how to repay you know how to uh kind of do for yourself i think i i really think that it's not so much that corrupt people go into it as that the process corrupts i i i would agree with you there well the other side of the coin too is that that the whole that the process even from the beginning uh you scratch my back i'll scratch yours uh i would even i would disagree with you a little bit because i think in the state level that's just part of the uh the internship so to speak and there's a lot of corruption i i think it depends a lot on on the state i think that it varies from state to state oh yes but but what i meant was why do people go why do people run for the school board because that's step one on the ladder oh oh man i don't want to talk about the school board we've just we've just been having school board meetings and it was like people suing each over over things they said  no you start okay what are the benefits well i i mean i don't even consider like salary a real benefit it just it's kind of a like a side thing i'm really here for you know working with lots of creative people is what i really like about my job um-hum well i think that i'm self-employed and work in radio and uh for me really i don't have to be terribly concerned about uh benefits outside because i own my own company but uh the worst problem that i think uh out here is affecting people and i think would be the most positive job benefit is job security these days that's true yeah yeah you don't you don't want to have worry about it you know if if you're worried you don't work as well yeah it's well it it's a real problem out here because uh you know it's hard to imagine that you know ten years ago i can remember where we really you know somebody would work for a local company here like Kodak or Xerox which are based here and uh they'd have that job for life and you really didn't have to worry too much about that but ever since this Reagan Bush thing i know every single time there's you know the the first thing they do is they fire employees whenever there's a problem with the uh uh economy economy and clear out the employees and we're losing more and more jobs and uh and it just gets worse then people don't don't spend any money yeah it's it's a real that's probably the biggest thing that i think people are looking for i uh put some things up in the Comp Dcom Telecom thing regularly about uh job security with the uh AT&T employees and right yeah i just i just noticed that yeah the Communication Workers of America and i'm watching as that progresses more and more and it seems to me that we're seeing a real problem with job security being the number one focus it's no longer a question of salary or or perks it it's just basic security to have that job yeah i know i know exactly how you feel but i i also don't know you know how how can we get people to change it i mean it it kind of it kind of requires you know a company taking a risk and they don't want to do that well i in well i think maybe some incentives on the part of the government to retain employees uh versus downsizing really why we're seeing that kind of downsizing is because of the uh increasing power of shareholders in the corporations of the country that's true whenever there's a uh problem with uh the economy or the stock value you know the first thing the stockholders want to see is well decrease costs which means cut employees i know i mean our CEO is is you know quite frankly stated that you know we're we're here to make stockholders happy and that's not why i'm working here yeah California is really starting to feel the effects i think of the uh downturn oh definitely you know you guys have been pretty insulated uh for some of the past ones it it hasn't hit as bad as it has out in the northeast here Rochester's luckily is a technology moving city i mean we have a lot of telecommunications and the like out here but right Buffalo and Pittsburgh and cities around here that were into mechanical and engineering and things like that steel mills they're all gone they're all in Mexico now yeah we're we're just kind of like losing and it it just seems to be a snowball effect i mean you know we keep losing more well Cupertino seems to be one of the every single software company ever sees always sees Cupertino you know so you guys at least don't have those kinds of you know the only problem software seems to be still a US strength versus hardware right and it but you know the again in the future we're going to see the same type of thing even in more white collar work where we're going to have job security i think being the biggest focus yeah it's things things aren't that secure in software right now either i think it's it's kind of a cutthroat i'm also a i'm also a hardware manufacturer i'm at Apple so it's like you know we we notice our product just becoming a commodity and that's really bad well i heard Apple was remaking themselves into a consumer electronics company we're trying and if it works that's that'd be great for us but what about you know the rest of the industry yeah well the hardware you know HDTV if we can keep control of that that looks like something that we could have good strengths on and there would be a lot of new jobs created yeah although although we we go on that subject i i because i looked at HDTV uh but i i don't like standards that are on it's still still on a fixed resolution which means it'll be eventually outdated also um-hum well we i'm a home satellite dish owner and we have these arguments all the time about standards because of the video cipher of the scrambling system um-hum in place and there's two separate arguments over whether we want should have an industry standard which many people can build equipment towards or whether we want to have a uh system where everybody's separate yeah it's it's a real serious serious problem in a situation of  i uh try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of repair actually uh that is really a sore spot with me i i think perhaps the automotive industry is improving but uh like ten years ago um the reliability of automobiles at least US automobiles was pretty dismal and not only that but the uh repair capability of uh service departments and dealerships was equally dismal and uh it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea um-hum yeah but uh i so do you have a car pardon do you have a car well at that time actually i had a Volkswagen Rabbit um-hum and um it was it it was a real lemon uh subsequently i got a uh Buick Century and it wasn't as bad um-hum but uh last year i bought a Honda Accord and i take it in once every seventy five hundred miles for its periodic maintenance and that is it and it's wonderful and yeah we used to have a Honda Accord and they're good they're really good cars every time i get taken to an auto repair place you know every time i go i get taken bad you know woman goes in and they go all right we got a sucker hm let's get how see how much money we can get out of her you know that's what happens every time um so hm hm so what do you what do you have i have a Pontiac six thousand all the more reason to uh have a a Honda yep but our Honda just got old and just wore out it was eleven let's see eleven years old and it just just out of it so so so you bought a Pontiac no uh-huh my husband uh um ex-husband's this this just happened couple of weeks ago he's my ex-husband but just a few months ago when he was my husband um his father gave us this car and everything is wrong with it i mean the power steering fluid leaks the oil leaks the brake fluid leaks you know now this what how old is the car um eighty seven and he just doesn't take care of things and but i was awarded the car so there is a man in my church that is a mechanic and i can trust him hm so he's trying to get you know things fixed on it but it's just you know leak leak leak everywhere but um hm you know i hate to go into a a repair place because they'll tell me something's wrong with it and it's not you know and charge me twice as much the last time i took it into a repair shop the man told me i needed a master cylinder so i said okay and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars and then um about a month later a man was looking at my car and he asked me you know not a man not a repair man but just a friend and i was telling him that i just had a new master cylinder put on and he said looked at and he said that's not a new master cylinder hm and i didn't even know what one was and um he showed it to me and it was old rusty just awful it was no more new than nothing so apparently it was the same one that was on there oh more than likely oh we just uh refilled refilled uh probably filled the the brake fluid up and that was it that was it probably it was very i was so irritated and that's happened to me more than once or twice just just just about every time i've went in somewhere so what's the solution to that i guess find a reputable service and and you just i can't hardly find one you know hm the guy that's doing most of my my car now um goes to my church and that's the only reason you know i go to him um-hum because i know him and i know he will tell me the truth because he doesn't even charge me for for doing it so he's not gonna you know hm take me yeah i just pay for the parts and he does it so right well that's wonderful yeah yeah i am so you're lucky i don't know i don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car they're usually the worst one of all we took our Honda to the Honda dealership and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car oh really yeah and so idiots as we were neither one of us knew much about cars we you know they told us we just had to have one and we bought one we didn't no more need no new engine give me a break you know so it was it was not good hm and um  well um preferred benefits um i worked for a large corporation in the past and i think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because right now i'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there and uh there's a lot of profit that's coming in but when it comes to uh small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quick quickly or whatever or however you wanna say it and uh the benefits aren't as great as when i worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay we've got this amount of money let's put into this plan this plan you got Four O One K plans you have uh better vacation plans uh you have just in general maternity leave plans that that kind of thing big corporations are able to do that versus um-hum small corporations uh you know they just don't have the money or just uh feel that there isn't a need for it so i've worked for both big and small so i've had a chance to kind of take a look at uh the pros and cons of both right well i've worked for uh well i worked for H and R Block here in Massachusetts for awhile and the only they even hate to give out unemployment sure um-hum sure um-hum at the end of tax season because they you know they're fairly even though they're a large scale company they're very the offices individual offices are very small sure uh-huh and now i work for the Framingham school teacher uh school system because i'm a teacher and uh we have much better benefits uh-huh sure you know in the system we have a good pension plan um let me see we have a profit sharing plan to a degree uh-huh that's pretty good for you know being a a school district type program right and we have the eye glasses the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw the all the town employees in together um-hum wow that's extremely good yeah because like like the small corporation that i work for there's no pension plan there's no type of uh savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for really there's really i think you're allowed so many times uh i think two or three days a week a year it's not accumulative type of sick leave oh um you know things like that so i've been looking at big corporations and saying the big corporation that i've worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health health care uh you had your insurance and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a a very small place um they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations right the only trouble we've had here in Massachusetts is the town and state employees have run into problem especially the retired ones my father's retired from the town of Framingham and um-hum sure and he said that they haven't gotten a a cost of living raise in over five years no yeah yeah and he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired and but i hear that bill is in the Senate right now and it's uh-huh sure sure hopefully will go through yeah yeah but um you know i think the schools are at where the schools isn't just the school system and not just the teachers they took in the whole town plus all you know um-hum is it a union uh we have the teachers union which helps out a lot but the town of Framingham pays the benefits and um-hum oh that's pretty good that's all the town workers water and sewer and where it's a very large town it's actually should be a city but they kept it a town um-hum sure um where it's extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more which was really great because we don't have to pay a mayor yeah uh-huh yeah yeah i know what you mean and that's true i mean yeah it it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position sure right because most of our you know the town employees as far as uh electoral positions are part time uh-huh so it works out good because we reap the benefits of it and um sure uh-huh but as far as shopping for a job i'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary well that's it you know and and i've kind of looked around uh at that uh too because uh salary wise i don't think i'm making as much with a big corporation because i think when you look at big corps or large i'm talking like huge companies like Three M um i'm Honeywell uh uh Texas Instruments i know people that are that have vacation times and benefits benefits that right i wouldn't even dream of in this small corporation you bring it up to the owner and it's like come on you know partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer right and and of course when it's a small corporation it also wants to expand so that money's spent in a  uh do you know anyone that uh has is in a nursing home or has ever been in one no but i my grandparents were looking into it before so i know what they've said uh-huh um-hum well i'm trying to think my uh uh wife's grandmother had Alzheimer's and they were going to put her into a a nursing home and uh they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a a you know a a nuisance or worse than a nuisance i mean she she sort of went you know bananas and they couldn't couldn't deal with her oh they thought it was too much of a bother so i guess you need to uh know whether it's a you know no deposit no return kind of thing whether right if they're equipped too to handle the kind of patients you're gonna have you know to put in there too because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still yeah right they wanted someplace they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her but they wanted to be independent as well right have their own room my grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that um there was a retirement hotel and then a uh there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it so for um the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes but could could also go and eat someplace else um-hum and then um as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to um provide full-time care and um she didn't have to do anything anymore but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly and that's some i don't know whether that's because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the what the reason is but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something well a lot of that's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help they need health care so they're already ill before they go yeah right that's probably a large factor yeah if if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you stay where you are and then you only go there as a last resort um-hum or people send you there as a last resort right right that's my grandparents it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them uh-huh so that was their thinking somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency right and also so they could find someplace they enjoyed while they still had choices to make so they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time i guess that's a problem too for people wait lists right and all that um you can't always get in when you want to and of course you can't just sit around and wait yeah i guess right when you need it you need it i guess yeah and the money is also another issue how you're gonna pay for it right at that stage of life you only have so much money left and i guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put in their savings i mean it is kind of fair but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise yeah sure so that's another problem and you probably if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price right right so it's it's just so complicated anymore i think people outlive their savings and with medicine being the way it is you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore yeah well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing it's just a shame that's the way it has to be i think the retirement home idea's a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay and yeah because uh like if your spouse died all of a sudden you be all alone it'd be nice to go someplace people similar to you and have friends right i i've known quite a few people that have um gone to retirement communities i don't know if they have them back there but here in California and in Arizona  um i've had uh three boys through i guess uh some child care each one of them and now they're in school so it's all over but uh i guess i would say it's not easy to find what what most parents would want well i can profit by this because i'm due with my first in about three months is that right i guess uh the um the only rule i can think of is that uh i like to find look for places with uh good respectable nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that if they're associated with a college or a university they're usually pretty good bet no um i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy car or refrigerator something you'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care i guess not usually i suppose you're absolutely right there um-hum i yeah for profit places i would really look at them awfully carefully but uh when i was when my kids were young i was teaching at a university and uh the child care center associated with our university was quite good so i felt confident that they would do the right thing um-hum of aren't don't they kind of use them for everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs for their personal for their pet theories or some such thing oh you mean uh learning type uh yeah i mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission but yeah i suppose um yes if you're if there's a psychology department or an education department around you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another i guess that's true but uh i never had a bad experience in that respect of course you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents and they're you know pretty good people um well the thing i really worry about is um the sexual abuse cases you read about um-hum and i mean you just feel awful if something like that happened i yeah i never really worry very much about it i tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public so i never really worried too much about that being uh um-hum uh the case with my boys oh um i you know i think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them but i don't think it's as common as uh the newspapers would make you believe um-hum um-hum and another thing is cost oh yeah i mean i mean i know so many of my friends i went to school with who are having babies right now and they finding some cases they're finding that it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in day care that right hm well in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were um in school and i'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult and i think it was the right thing to do when we were um hm we just decided that we would do it and we went ahead but um not everybody can make that choice and even even though my wife wasn't working we did have um one or another of the boys in uh child care for part time just for part of the day um or a couple of days a week just so that uh other things could get done around the house and so on so hm so we did look around i think my wife is much better than i am at just walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it's a loving and caring place or not and uh so i would always trust her judgment on that hm hm well i'm just thanking heaven my husband just got a new job his last company he was only working four days a week so it's and he just got a new job he's getting lots of overtime he got a pay raise uh-huh and so i'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not there's absolutely no question that you're gonna be the best child care provider for that kid so yeah do it as long as you can i suppose but i think you know you you have to look through a place and you have to get a feel for um how they treat the kids and uh uh what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you uh commit your child to them and i think um-hum um-hum you have the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open that you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth and if they're at all queasy about that then you have to start wondering if they don't want yes i'd look elsewhere yeah right hm you have other friends that have kids uh being taken care of in uh child care um i have one but i haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while um-hum so but i really think the news reports are uh tend to sensationalize the problems i think the problems are more ones of um-hum cost and resources and um pay and exhaustion and human things like that rather than these um uh really wild wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy this is true yeah Current Affair can get several shows with those cases yeah right uh-huh well  you an avid magazine reader uh not really i don't really read any regularly uh in the past i use to read some i use to read Time all the time oh uh-huh but i guess that was just it i don't know too much reading to do so i stopped doing it so um do you read for work or something yeah i do a lot of reading for work because i i don't know i just have a lot of research literature to keep up on is the thing so huh are you in the scientific field or something yeah i'm in computer science ah well uh my thoughts about magazines are uh that they're kind of a quick fix i watch very little TV and i i like to read a lot uh-huh but if i'm feeling jumpy i kind of enjoy a magazine because everything's short and you can you know lay perhaps look at the pictures read an article for a couple of pages you don't feel like you've committed yourself to all the time it takes to read five hundred pages right it's just the thing is i i don't know i just have a tendency to want to read everything no matter what i buy what i buy so it's kind of weird oh yeah your pretty thorough if you're going to it right yeah i don't know it's uh just a weird thing about me so i try not to buy anything that i'm afraid of reading the whole thing so oh if you're in a doctor's office and they have all kinds of stuff what are you attracted to yeah oh i don't know um i i like reading up on the news um and sometimes i like some science stuff but not much actually so i mean because Popular Science type magazines aren't usually very uh i don't know yeah scientific so scientific how about you what do you read uh well uh in the magazine world i guess i'm kind of i hate to stereotype myself because i'm not all that girlish in the sense of girlish you know i i can solder and all of that kind of good stuff uh-huh uh-huh but in my magazines when i think about it um i have a cooking magazine i like because i like to cook and there's some this thing called Country Home which has uh it's kind of a mellow thing with all kinds of American and uh you i don't know recipes and decorating and all kinds of girl stuff uh-huh i'm almost embarrassed to say that girl stuff huh well it's not girl stuff it just you know good stuff that's all well the other day i was talking with a fellow about woodworking and and that's another thing i love to do uh-huh i'm an artist and i'm into all kinds of crafts and things so i can i can saw and solder and all kinds of you know things that would make me not sound like the typical you know cutesy housewife type right but i guess in magazines i guess i you know i run the line i suppose that's true uh-huh uh at we have some Road and Track magazines around the house my oldest son likes and i'll pick that up too uh-huh i enjoy it i like to look at the stuff i'd love to have if i had all the money to buy it well yeah i i find it interesting to read just about anything that's lying around usually i mean it's always interesting stuff i don't i wouldn't normally buy you always just well i don't know like i had an old friend who use to read Cosmopolitan all the time and i thought it was the most ridiculous magazine but it was just so interesting to find out i don't know about the culture of people who read Cosmopolitan you know it's kind of like sneaking a peek at the other side i know what you mean right i'm a big fan of the library i you know i i i don't really reread books so with the price of the paperbacks and even the hardcovers going up i just why not use the library they'll even get anything you ask them to find for you so you know why not do that but i am a big fan of the new book rack you walk in uh-huh and they've got all the new books and to me it's like a little treasure opening this crispy you know covered brand new book and i'll come home with the strangest things that i'd never would have picked out uh-huh because you know they run through the whole Dewey decimal system and you know there was one on Alpine skiing that looked interesting and one on you know wood carving that looked interesting and you know you just find these things that right um well it's refreshing to pick up something that you would never go to a rack for i think um-hum right but i don't know that i have that much more to say about wood carving about wood carving i'm not even speaking thinking straight here about magazines um any other thoughts on your part uh not in particular no um so do you read you're an artist then so do you read a lot of art magazines at all or yeah um there are some um i'm particularly interested in the crafts and there is one called American Craft that lists all the shows and that kind of thing and um um-hum craft shows are a lot of fun to go to when it's not some some housewife in quotes who put lace on a pair of socks and sells that as a craft i mean that makes me crazy you know but if it's really truly beautiful pottery and and you know hand hewn wood stuff like that yeah then i really enjoy it and and i'm going to start taking up some pottery which i've never done myself i've gone from woodworking to silver jewelry making to stain glass uh-huh and pottery turning clay on a wheel is something i've never done and i just discovered  okay well i'll just briefly um i worked in a nursing home so i kind of know from way back uh how things used to be run and i think there's been definite changes of nursing homes but i think uh if i personally had to put one of my parents in a nursing home they would have to be pretty bad off to where i couldn't take care of them at all it would be something that you know i would certainly if they're forgetting things or whatever i'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care uh-huh where somebody comes in and they cook meals and they clean their house for them that kind of thing so they still have their own independence and not reliable you know they don't have to be in a nursing home situation but uh i don't think the nursing homes when i was working in them were very much understaffed very much uh in need of good personnel um i think the patients weren't given the quality of care that i wouldn't have you know i look at it and say thank God i got out of that kind of situation but uh they they were not given the time and they were not given the money basically to staff appropriately people to help and yeah uh-huh i can remember lifting a patient all by myself simply because there was not another person to help it's either let leave the patient in bed all day long or get them up and i would have preferred to get them up than than to leave them in bed all day but uh um so i think nursing homes are have changed i'm not quite sure but hopefully they have yeah well the i guess i haven't had that much experience i've only seen like my great grandparents in a nursing home but um-hum yeah i have an aunt who lived on her own until she was well in her nineties and then she she got sick and she ended up in a nursing home sure um-hum and my parents went to visit her and it got to the point where the nursing it seemed like the nursing home didn't want to deal with her anymore sure and so they gave her drugs to keep her asleep yeah i i think that's that can happen and i think in the nursing home that i worked for i wasn't quite sure of it but i'm sure that some of the patients were uh given medication to keep them in uh quiet and and nice sedative state yeah yeah and they would just lay all day long and uh the ones that they also put mentally ill patients in the same they were not on the same you know ward but they they were in the same nursing home so that these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other uh older people that were in there for reasons of uh you know age uh the mentally ill patients could walk right in into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing they could they had freedom to just walk around and a lot of them were i think there was a couple that were schizophrenic and i remember one time watching one of the uh schizophrenic patients actually go out on i don't know what they call it a binge or whatever you want to say it but uh-huh she grabbed a hold of this and it was kind of funny when i look back at it but i mean i remember the patient getting very upset that person woman actually pulled uh the other person's hair i mean she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair you know and it was a guy that was just really upset i mean he's what the hell are you think you're doing you know and i laughed at it then but then i'm thinking God you know if i had to put my parents in that nursing home i wouldn't want them there yeah so i think there's laws now that kind of protect that nursing homes either have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people and not in the same type of facilities even though they're aging mentally ill they are still mentally ill and a lot of these older people have their you know they're not insane or anything like that they don't have these tendencies to to lash out be violent but seeing that kind of made me think twice about jeez i wouldn't put my mother father in that nursing home at all was this in a big town or a little town a small town oh really yeah yeah it seem like the small town nursing homes i don't know i there's a lot more personal attention i don't know i i kind of look at it this way i think if you have a big city area i think there's more people to keep watch on it uh-huh you have more options and yeah yeah and you have more competition and i think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community and this is back in nineteen seventy seven that i worked there uh-huh and i look back at it and say jeez you know i it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there but my grandmother uh later on got cancer and uh could no longer well actually she  what do you think well um i can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago um because i'm not that old yet uh oh i can be but go ahead um um i know that uh i mean obviously you look at at technological the technological aspect of of social change i mean you didn't have uh you didn't have video games you didn't have home computers you didn't have Xerox machines right i mean uh you you try to you go into a a business today and you you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper and it's almost inconceivable now because the Xerox machines and and everything have become such you know such such a a part of the way we live and the yeah right we fax everything we don't even wait for the mail anymore um-hum right yeah uh a business associate of mine was was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail and you had to do something this was concerning the S E C and so if they had business to do they had to finish it you know three days in advance so they could get it through the mail right and now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute um-hum because you can get it there you know in in a matter of minutes right you know through a fax machine and because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have actually made work that much more intense and that much harder right because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute you're expected to exactly and i recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse it should be less because we have a microwave and our grandmother's had to bake brownies and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes but the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us and we have no downtime um-hum like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to yeah so we keep moving we don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen we just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing so we have no relaxation time in between um-hum so they say that's really a bad thing that you need to learn a lot of ways to to deal with that and get your your time in between things um-hum so that's good that's an interesting point but i just think our our family lives have changed drastically and i think that's just of course a part of it is technology i mean our kids where would they be without Nintendo and you know their TV shows and that and some of that is really bad i think but we have all single families so many single families now um a lot of working both parents are working so there's a whole big effect on our kids and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father you know i'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years well there's that and there's the fact that you know nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids what generally tends to happen i mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country you're probably right and i'm an O B nurse and that's never really occurred to me but that's that's interesting i never really thought about it that way yeah yeah i saw that the numbers on that awhile back and i was like uh-huh yeah yeah that's true when is this good or not good well um we don't know that yet in terms of the long term effect effect on on America in terms of the culture and everything i don't know um yeah i don't know either most of the of the next generation is going to be in or or an extremely extremely extremely large part part of the next generation is going to be you know second generation from uh from immigrant parents that's true and they're going to be really struggling and i don't think that America is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good right right i mean it's no longer the the uh the accomplishment that it that it once was and not that many people are really trying i don't think yeah yeah that's kind of scary hum well that's true but i it's just very very different and i guess every ten years it's just been very different yeah so and i don't know what's gonna happen um i know what i'm seeing here at my well my job is that people are having their children much later in life yeah that so that they're establishing careers and they've got their homes and they've got a lot  okay how do you get your news mostly generally i get most of my news from uh the radio and then sometimes um if i've got time i'll be reading the front page of the newspaper and just fall off on the articles that i like um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um also since my wife likes to watch TV sometimes uh just having being just being there i get uh you know i have to watch the news late at night with TV um-hum um-hum well i can hardly wait for my morning paper to come how about you um-hum so that's the first thing i want is the headlines it's really funny because um uh my sister grabs the sports and i grab the headlines uh-huh but uh and then when five o'clock comes around i just wanna get in the house and turn the TV on to watch the news hm it's really weird uh i don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long but um i love to watch the five o'clock news and i makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time so i can read my paper hm uh i do have my radio going most of the day though so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too you know but okay do you get what like one of the talk stations the news stations no huh-uh just i just have a channel that has music except for like every hour you know say eight o'clock nine o'clock they come on for just a little bit of the news sure right but as far as the actual news i get that from from the can you hold on just for a second just a minute sure hello sir yes i'm sorry to keep you waiting um i was calling from work so and that was a call waiting yes okay right sounds it sounds like you uh you like the news a lot more than i do me i figure if it's something really important somebody will tell me about it but uh you know i thing is if if i catch the news all the time it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news or that's what comes on first yeah i get um that's true too and uh you know it also late at night you know i don't want like watching the news late at night but my wife's usually up then and so you know i can't go to sleep with the TV on um-hum um-hum um-hum i uh but you know i i wish i had uh more news on things like that i consider long range things like science and medicine um um-hum i'm more i guess i'm more into science and science fiction and uh there's you know not that the news is science fiction but uh uh i'm more interested in that things like uh is NASA ready for another space shot uh you know how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer and uh um um-hum you know a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me yeah well you're right there is a lot of it that's that's just garbage as far as i'm concerned you know um-hum but i just like the more or less the the daily news you know yeah just uh especially the weather i like that although they're usually wrong me too yeah Georgia here they're usually wrong too we have weird weather systems uh-huh but uh like i say as far as that's actually listening to the news it's mostly TV five o'clock to six thirty oh that seems like a long time for news but that's how long it is yeah and uh seems like they have the local news and they have the world news um-hum and then uh my morning paper i can hardly wait for it to come yeah i'm you know i i just uh i would i i i'm not a morning person so i would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news and um i get up just barely in time to get up get ready and get off to work and then at work i have no time to read the news oh yeah right once you get to work i wouldn't either huh-uh yeah but i've always been a morning person to get up you know um-hum and but i can't stay up late at night to watch the late news so i guess that's why i watch it at five o'clock but anyhow well listen i guess that's about it then yeah okay it's been nice talking to you Tony nice talking to you i'll probably talk to you again i had a friend who was in this and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes yeah oh really oh well that hasn't happened to me yet so you never know it might this time okay Tony um-hum bye-bye that's right take it easy bye-bye  have you any wisdom to offer someone picking a college oh well i think i think the biggest thing that's important is to is to learn enough about the student to match the student well to the to the school and one thing i learned i went undergraduate to Harvard and then came out to Berkeley and it's pretty clear that there are some people who thrive at Berkeley uh and there are some people who who just die here because of the the amount of support that's given and the amount of uh bureaucracy you have to deal with and other things like that are are you saying that that there's more bureaucracy et cetera at out in California at that particular school uh in a large public school i think in general ah and uh this is a school with some thirty thousand students and it is set up in such a fashion that students register for classes months in advance and if they don't get them they may not get a chance to take them that year um average graduation has crept up closer and closer to five years largely because of the number of students who can't get all of the courses to fulfill their major on time uh on the hand this is that seems so wasteful it is and and it's happening in in a lot of public schools uh because of of budget cuts but on the other hand what it does provide is is for the um for students who who need a chance to be forced to fend for themselves uh who have perhaps been too isolated this is a a case where they're they're forced to do that and and my wife went here as an undergraduate she had been sort of protected right through high school and and had to learn to to make it on her own and she graduated from the place in four years by learning to be smart and picking courses that uh at the right times and right priorities and i can see that as advantageous but there are a lot of people for whom this is just a waste of time hum that it's interesting you're approaching it from the sort of administrating your education just you know trying to get the class and be there i was thinking in terms of um how would you advise a kid uh on how to pick his future career i i have a son whose a freshman in high school um-hum and he hasn't got a clue you know what he wants to do you know he's good in math and science and he'll you know um-hum uh his stepdad's an engineer his father's an accountant you know he he'll probably lean toward some kind of math or science kind of thing but he's not sure what i myself graduated with an undergraduate and a Master's in art um-hum um-hum and i did it because it's just something i love to do and i felt that i'm not i'm not a Picasso so i guess i'll teach and i kind of backed myself into a career that i never ended up really using i mean now that i'm raising my kids i'm substitute teaching because the hours are so good et cetera um-hum um-hum but i had never given that much thought to whether i actually liked to teach you know it just seemed that well that's a practical thing you can do with art so you might as well do it right and i guess my advice to uh kids approaching college would first of all do something practical because the art for me um didn't work out very practically i got out of school when the Vietnam draft evasion was going on and everybody wanted to be a teacher there were no jobs and i ended up taking a secretarial school summer class for graduate college graduates which it struck me as so sad just just to be able to find a job that you would qualify for so sad you know there's a whole bunch of college graduates who are learning how to type just to be able to to make some money yeah well and um i i think one of the reasons that i don't see that as as much of a problem see i would encourage people to go into college not knowing what they want to do because so many of the high schools have done such a bad job at introducing different areas hum that it may be that what you want to do and it may be a very practical thing to go into doesn't seem attractive because what you've learned of it so far is is not interesting a lot of people are turned off from math because of high school math and going to a school that offers a lot of choice and taking your first year or two to explore what the choices are still gives you plenty of time and to pick so you you're suggesting some liberal arts program where you take a smattering of everything and then eventually focus on a single major i certainly wouldn't say to go to a liberal arts school that doesn't have a strong science program um-hum uh and i'd even encourage a liberal arts school with an engineering program but i tend to look i don't like what i see from the students who are graduating here with engineering degrees where seventy five or eighty percent of their time is spent in a prearranged technical curriculum um-hum and they are moving here towards a program where they have a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Science combined where you get a general education with guaranteed admission into an engineering degree for a Master's degree oh that and that seems like a good compromise it's  okay so we're supposed to discuss job benefits and such right uh what do you consider that you're lacking in benefits that you have that i'm lacking in benefits um the fact that they're not all paid for um-hum um i wish they were all paid benefits uh i share in our health insurance uh half and half um i'm also covered under my wife's so but uh i wish i wish they were all paid for i don't have a a a dental benefit um-hum um and uh i guess the benefits that i have i wish i had more of an HMO a health maintenance as opposed to kind of fix it after it's broken kind of maintenance well that's i've uh worked for companies that have had HMO before and it really is nice particularly if you aren't you know really set on any one specific doctor if if you're flexible yeah well i mean you get you get yearly physicals um-hum um and i mean they just seems to make sense to do it that way um-hum i guess in a perfect world in a perfect world uh but we aren't in a perfect world so i don't know uh other than that i don't really have any benefits per se how about yourself well i'm fortunate in that i have uh dental and i also have vision care the thing that i have had in the past that i wish that my company provided was uh a prescription a paid prescription plan prescription drugs because um-hum oh okay gotcha you know that they'll cover uh like for five dollars or something like that that you can get anything that you want right but um how about other other benefits of of the job i mean do you have uh what kind of uh time off do you have what type what type of work do you do uh i'm an administrative assistant for a software company huh okay and what about you i'm a broker i work with a uh brokerage house and we work with businesses in brokering their services or goods to other businesses how large is your company oh not too large that's part of the problem with the uh the health care program it's probably maybe uh twelve people oh you're right well the company i work for now in my office we have about eight people but it's like two thousand people overall gotcha and uh uh our benefits i guess are pretty good you know we well i guess actually we have quite a few offered to us we have 401K and i get two weeks vacation the first year and huh about uh ten holidays i guess one of which is a floating holiday that i can use at my discretion the now when you say a floating holiday what do you mean by that well it's just a day that you can use i guess you'd really consider it a personal day oh okay yeah so you have personal days you day uh i should say multiple or single just single okay but you can use um your holidays your holiday or uh vacation times split up into personal days i'm sorry can you split your holiday or vacation time into personal days or do you have to take them in bulk uh the vacation i think i can split you know i don't have to take it two or a week at a time or anything like that the holiday uh yeah the the one day i think i can just put it anywhere that i want to huh now does so that's nice does oh yeah uh does does your company do picnics or you know like uh tomorrow our company as a whole and i guess i would call this a benefit is uh we're going to the Red Sox home opener in uh Boston that's a benefit no we don't do anything like that yeah yeah you don't do you have any like company picnics or uh or get-togethers or things along those lines i don't think so as a matter of fact i've only been with the company a month and a half and uh i i asked my boss i think we do have a Christmas party although he indicated the budget is kind of low oh it always it usually is but then with just uh ten of us in the office you know as far as a company picnic or anything i don't think that there's enough of us you know to to get together and do something like that huh but uh uh the office is pretty free you know as far as if i decide that i want to go out to lunch with someone and i'm late coming back no one complains or says anything about it and if i need some time off to go to a doctor they wouldn't penalize me for that that's good i was yeah oh absolutely i mean the environment you work in is is uh crucial to the job and that counts um-hum uh we have somewhat we're somewhat in the same situation um i mean i feel i feel odd about taking any personal time anyway unless you know they knew about it or whatever but um right but being a sales organization we you know our time is our own i mean we're kind of independent contractors under a common goal type of thing um-hum so it's kind of the same situation although it sounds like your office structure is more structured as an office time um but you it's not so rigid that you know you punch a clock that type of thing well a lot of it depends on your position too you know other people that are in sales in the office they come and go  actually i'm in like i said i'm in Minneapolis and the big thing up here of course is the Twins um i imagine you can't escape it no it's it's pretty pervasive it kind of goes into about all aspects of society i think up here but um actually i don't know how much of the World Series you caught last year but that was a lot of fun well of course it was fun for you well to be honest with you i'm not from Minneapolis in fact i've only been up here a few months and i'm going back at the end of next month to uh Orlando Florida oh really so i'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything but i was born and raised in uh near Miami and uh spent the last twenty years in Dallas oh yeah oh uh where the Rangers played uh-huh and uh for the last uh what year roughly year i've been in San Francisco where there're two teams the Oakland A's and the San Francisco Giants right uh but honestly you know i uh i do my duty and watch the sports on uh the newscast oh okay but that's about all the exposure i have to sports yeah yeah i haven't followed it real closely at all um except like i said last year when the World Series rolled around i did i did follow that pretty religiously went out to the bars you know drank a beer watched the game sat a girl a good time that way um-hum well yeah sure well i guess the uh San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A's were like the leading teams a couple years ago but uh is that right well i think i don't know well that's sort of what i gather um-hum um and uh i don't know what is the prognosis for uh this year uh real good as far as i can tell people are pretty excited about oh good i i assume that means good for the Minnesota well yeah sorry about that yeah uh as far as the Twins are concerned it seems to be real good um my roommate went and saw them play um their season opener uh a couple of nights ago and they they won that one seven to one so um that's pretty good i guess it looks like they'll be doing pretty well are you still there yep okay i heard some noise on the line didn't know what happened i think a train went by oh okay all right but i know a train went by i don't know what the noise was but i think it probably was the the train yeah well i don't know i i i don't even know uh who who has been winning in uh as far as the uh San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A's but i think they both won their opener i sort of gathered that in my uh subliminal memory uh-huh well maybe that has has good tidings for their uh for their season coming up i've actually got a friend that's living in San Francisco right now uh he's doing the same thing i'm doing which is basically uh an internship we were both doctoral students and he's doing his with IBM and i'm doing mine with Honeywell but um i i think he kind of follows the sports and i think he's mentioned um the Oakland A's a couple times hm um-hum uh he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good i guess they're in different leagues is that right the A's as far as i know yeah and in the major leagues i guess there's a couple of different divisions and then of course there's the minors um yeah i don't know i i guess i'm one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort i could really probably get into baseball um-hum um but i was talking to my roommate a couple nights ago right after that game and he offered you know to take me to one of the games because apparently he'd bought uh he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat or a row of seats actually um-hum um-hum for the home games but the the thing is there's like eighty six home games per year so there's no no way you can ever use them all eighty six eighty six i was amazed to hear that you know that's just the home games and i i thought it was a mistake but he goes no see eight well they must play every day then yeah well just just about yeah i mean eighty six times two yeah is a hundred and sixty and that's you know yeah that's almost and that's Lord that's uh over five months worth that's a lot of baseball even if they play every day that's over five months worth well you you if you if you consider it the season starts well it's the season started about a week and a half ago and it ends with the World Series which usually takes place i believe in December or January no yeah i think so it did last week year didn't it or was it November that was the Super Bowl maybe it was November i'm thinking about i know it was doggone cold up here um i don't feel so bad i think you you don't know all that much more than i do about baseball well i know for sure it was i know it was after September because that's when i got up here i see okay and it and it was at least two months after i got up here oh really okay well yeah so it had to be November anyway well i i i know uh the Super Bowl  okay well i how how how do you feel about that i think it's great um i think like socialized medicine um i think it's a very good idea personally because right now i don't have any health insurance at all um-hum and i just know that it's first you know i could get it where i work and but it would be like a hundred dollars a month which is a lot to me and i really just can't afford it uh i have worked places where i had insurance but you know on a more i work for a very small company now and i i realize that you know it would for that to be true you'd you'd have to increase taxes and stuff like that but uh i know other people that are you know in the same situation and when it's just uh i if you don't work for a large company it's really hard to have insurance um i would be willing to you know pay more taxes but uh and i i think it's just i think everybody should have the option to have health care i mean i don't think you know but the only way to do that would be to you know have to tax more yeah there there wouldn't have to be some way to pay for it the the i agree with you that that uh it's no fun to to not have insurance i'm i've had health insurance through my uh either my parents uh employment or my employment for many years but uh now i'm looking as at a layoff situation and i'm sitting here saying well how much is it going to cost me um-hum the uh the prospect of going without health insurance is is uh not very exciting to me either um-hum uh the the problem that i have with with uh universal health insurance is the problem of basically just absolute and complete distrust for the politicians they'll start i mean they could they could say we're going to do it the right way in the beginning and convince me um-hum but i don't have a lot of faith that they would uh that they would not use it as a as a uh oh as a carrot to get votes uh my i called and asked uh the uh unemployment insurance people here i said how long you know what's the unemployed what do i get if i'm unemployed and how long will i get it you know it's very interesting the guy on the other end is a young man he said uh uh with a good sense of humor he says well he says right now it's twenty six weeks uh in periods of severe unemployment and just before an election they will extend it and get all the votes of the people that that like that but he says in your case uh if you're going uh to be needing it in a little while by the time you get to the end of your twenty six weeks uh the elections will be over and we won't have it anymore i can tell you that um-hum so i so i'm uh uh i'm i'm uh for the first time i'm i'm seeing things to a uh i'm paying attention to things that i never paid before uh attention attention attention to right yeah you don't really think about it until you you're in a situation where you have to think about it on the other hand like i say they i have i have lived in places where they had uh free medical care and i have to say that that uh that it that it was uh it was comforting to know that you had it but but the way it worked in practice was that uh in order to get enough doctors the uh they used a lot of student doctors a lot more than people would put up with over here um-hum and uh my wife has dozens and dozens of stories of people that went in for a simple operation and then died on the table because of the incompetent care um so i'm and and she didn't have any axe to grind you know she just grew up in that situation and said well that's the way it is and uh so on the one hand i i'm i'm saying well now i know how people that don't have insurance feel and on the other hand i'm saying uh i don't trust the politicians very much i think that they are very good at at uh huh i think they're so corrupt that they just use it as a vote getting uh situation and they don't pay and and they don't make it a very uh there's not a lot of integrity to the things that they do well by the um the same note of what you're saying there could be pros in that situation um for their being  well Harris what was your most recent woodworking project my most recent woodworking project was i made an oak trash can oh all right all right it's the new thing around here is people want trash cans which match their kitchen cabinets oh that's rather clever i hadn't thought of that so and i'm if the definition of a professional means you get paid for it then i am one oh is that right yeah i really am in the telecommunications business but you know one has to do what you can do to make a buck huh well maybe a small business of woodworking on the side then do you have a lot of woodworking tools i got uh well your basic stuff your radial arm your table your drill press yeah what i don't do is i don't i don't turn that that's almost a whole another world i think well you know it you know i build boxes as people say yeah yeah well i subscribe to both Fine Home Building and Fine Woodworking uh-huh are you familiar with those oh yeah i am i don't get either one i look through them at the uh at the newsstand and buy them on occasion i get a a newspaper called the Workshop News and i get a uh um let's see i can't read the side of it huh uh Woodsmith i think it's called huh it's a you know a monthly sort of brown paper type of type of thing yeah yeah well the the thing i like about the two magazines i mentioned is they're so inspirational oh yeah oh i've looked through both of them you can just only afford to subscribe to so many that's right that's right i there's an i think i like the Fine Home Building better uh-huh in terms uh one of my projects is adding molding to a rather plain house uh yes now there you can get upside down and backwards doing crown molding that's right that's right you know as soon as you get your head upside down and backwards you're fine that describes it perfectly i made an armoire recently for my wife's store um and the top of it has curved crown molding oh boy that will yeah uh-huh it sure did even if you're an engineer by training that can be a little tricky can't it well what you had to it wasn't what i did was i made it up out of the crown molding around the top and the the tricky part was not making up the crown molding it was how did you cut it how did you miter the corners uh-huh i know i know i i've been through that uh do you do a lot of projects or is this is this just mostly a hobby uh-huh no i don't build it if somebody is not buying it oh okay i mean uh i build a uh i have a stock English garden bench which i make uh-huh which i instead of making out of redwood which is really dear on the east coast uh-huh is i make it up out of your regularly old forty CPI pressure treated lumber uh-huh and then paint it oh which saves on the cost uh-huh we have a lot of those at the building where i work and i think they're made out of teak yeah teak is awfully expensive but the the thing about teak is you can't set it on the ground you have to set it like on flagstone or concrete or something does it whit too badly or what yeah it's just not made for direct ground contact it pulls the it pulls the oil right out of it huh it it's all right outside if you go out every year and you know oil it but you know the the old green pressure treated you can ignore it if the paint falls off it's still not going to hurt the wood sure yeah you know the paint's only just to cover up the fact it's green it sounds like you're much more of a woodworker than i am i just kind of dabble in it i have done some refinishing oh oh uh-huh of antiques and semi-antiques uh-huh and a little bit of repair work on that sort of thing yeah i don't do a whole lot of that i've done some i one nice thing about living in this area is the Smithsonian nearby Smithsonian is nearby uh-huh and they have you can call them the their restoration lab and they're happy to talk to you oh is that right so you might file that if you don't mind paying the long distance charges huh their restoration labs will be very happy are very happy to talk to you and say you know and you say hey i've got on what do i do now i had no idea is the lab any place close to the mall or is it yeah it's very close to the mall it's actually located in the  all righty okay do you have a budget that you go on yeah i sure do um i have it's pretty much a ledger sheet and i just write down all my bills how much i'm going to have to pay and i do it per paycheck for me which is every other week uh i mean i include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments you know everything um-hum um-hum um-hum and it tends to work out pretty well that way i can anticipate you know a little better i usually try to guesstimate and then when the bill actually comes in i go ahead and fill in the actual amount um-hum um-hum that way i know how much pocket change i'm going to have left at the end of the month or at the end of the paycheck anyway um-hum um-hum uh-huh so that works okay for me uh-huh well my bills i usually know approximately how much they're going to be each month they are more or less just about the same you know right uh-huh same here uh very seldom are they any different and then uh like for groceries and everything we try to put like two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can in the kitchen uh-huh um-hum and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with oh okay and then we put our receipts in there you know and usually that's enough um-hum and um but i don't have any you know small children to have anything extra come up you know like uh running to the doctor or something like that with them right luckily i don't either i mean you know maybe my cat would get sick but i mean usually that's not so much that it would throw me off yeah yeah right in fact i did have to take my dog to the vet the other day but you so you know what i'm saying yeah yeah that it's it's worse than having a kid huh i sometimes it can be sometimes it can be i guess the worst thing i've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things yeah um-hum but i do try to build in a little extra money each month to to be able to do that type of thing so yeah um i'm not working right now i worked for P I E and then uh they went bankrupt so i just went ahead and took my early pension um-hum oh uh-huh but i only get that once a month ooh that's tough yeah my roommate only gets paid once a month yeah so and that last week's pretty lean generally speaking so yeah so you know i really have to try to budget that i don't go over that amount you know each month right i for for years got paid once a month and and in ways i liked it because i could go ahead and pay all my bills at once um-hum there's always one or two stragglers that usually they were for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones um-hum um-hum but i would pay all of them at one sitting and i would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it yeah right and and that worked okay for me um-hum i don't know right now i i'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt i think as everybody is and so and oh yeah right now it's terrible isn't it it's yeah it's really bad but um it's going pretty well and i've got a real good plan mapped out here so yeah uh-huh i also like belong to a Christmas club because you know i used to belong to a Christmas club last year i didn't uh-huh then so then naturally Christmas comes along and that's puts you behind too you know so this year now i have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my checking account for my Christmas club oh that's yeah so i figure you know that's gonna help some that'll cover your gifts come Christmas time that'll yeah yeah right you know that'd be good because yeah most people are spending three or four months digging you know at least digging out after Christmas so yeah right right and i'm taking yeah i i was pretty fortunate this Christmas i didn't get in debt so oh that's good i'm taking like um sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what i can uh-huh so i won't have to go out and buy the readymade clothes anymore oh uh-huh it's so rare you hear anybody doing that any longer i know i even bought myself a Surger you know and i just love it i haven't learned everything to do on it yet but i figure that will help me save yeah you know my um roommate does sew some and and um i she hasn't sewed anything in a long time but i i'm sure that she could pick it up again my mother always sewed she tried to teach me when i was young but uh-huh not interested yeah well see some people are and some people aren't because i have some sisters i have three sisters and none of those are really interested in sewing yeah yeah but that's a real good way to save money though by doing that yeah and then i can also you know do some crafts and sell those at garage sales um-hum um-hum so which i've been doing well that's a good way to to make a little extra money um-hum well this is another way that i'm making a little extra money so that was you know nice that i tripped over this opportunity and you're actually my first call oh really oh yeah i had not um done well have you called i i guess today's today's my first day that i could even do it oh it is yeah you beat me to the punch here oh well that's nice that's nice you know i was i was about to call to get to see if i could get on with somebody so so that was great uh-huh yeah well i guess that's about all i can talk to about budgets when i was working i uh bought a bond a month out of my you know they automatically took it out of my out of my uh payroll yeah yeah i take have some money taken out and put in a 401K uh-huh  why don't you go ahead and start okay well i think the court systems could stand some improvement uh trial by jury is good but a lot of time it in in a lot of cases uh is circumstantial evidence that that convicts a person which i don't think is all the time good because sometimes it's hard to get all the facts and to prove a person innocent i mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have a eyewitness and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me i don't know so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit or not to convict people on circumstantial evidence i think so you know i i attended a trial in uh in Germany when i was a student and uh um-hum that's the sort of system they have the trials are held by a panel of three uh three or four judges who are well they're like lawyers i guess they're experts in the law and uh there there really isn't a jury and uh right uh they do the questioning also the judges do the questioning and uh um-hum they uh it's i think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they uh uh the judge is also sort of a jury uh but i'm not sure i like that i think i prefer the jury system myself you think you prefer the jury you think your chances are better uh well actually i think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or a jury what i what i worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual that's where you really need a jury of peers well that's true because uh anytime the the government um is the government against the individual you need some kind yeah they need the protection of ordinary citizens i think that's really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the system system change is uh um there ought to be uh um well i guess i don't think that uh um juries need to decide sentencing all the time i think maybe the a judge is a better judge of that or um um-hum well sometimes sometimes the sentencing is still is not fair i mean even if well the jury i guess they do decide that but but i'm like you in a case like that most time its i don't know maybe i'm too too uh uh conservative when it come to that the the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases yeah you know uh well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent that's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe right but people who don't who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison's really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see i think that is maybe uh a little bit naive yeah in Texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people um um-hum it's kind of a um hanging jury atmosphere but in a lot of places i think people bend over the other way but right i guess i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it some cases some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that oh really i kind of like that system yeah yeah that's that's not a bad system but i i do think it need to be shaken up a little bit but the thing is too maybe they need more of uh yeah i don't know more of a expert types yeah to to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick you know Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and and call them in right and lawyers blow sand in their eyes exactly i would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries right right exactly insurance cases and things like that yeah where and um there'd be more honest settlements instead of this um uh tugging of people's heart strings and um making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them um-hum putting putting on a act or whatever or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering um-hum exactly exactly so in i think in in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government but in civil trials i'd like  well i think Don that maybe immigration is more of an issue in my part of the country than it is in yours do you suppose that's true well you're probably right up here in Rochester we uh but we don't have uh much controversy about immigration you know being on the Canadian border there's not a whole lot of people you know dying to come across and live here yeah maybe uh they have a problem sometimes i think they ought to yeah well of course we're quite a ways from the Mexican border here uh-huh but uh oh you hear on the news and whatnot of uh some of the sad things associated with immigration like uh loading up a truck full of immigrants and it runs out of gas or something and they sit out in the bake in the sun because they're locked in the back of it and things like that um-hum yeah so there are a lot of tragedies i think associated with immigration yeah i think it's uh i think it's a real shame but on the other hand you know it kind of even with all the tragedies if you step back and look at it the fact that people want to come here must be that there's something better here than or at least they think there's something better here than there is uh wherever they're from yeah oh absolutely absolutely i i mean that the what i see is Mexico of course rather South American countries yeah uh-huh uh unfortunately i think that that the immigrants tend to really stretch the social services that can be provided to the folks uh uh-huh yeah yeah that's true but i think that's probably always been true throughout uh history of the United States uh i think anytime you have uh you know immigrants coming in who perhaps you know don't have the ability to communicate with a large percentage of the population that's already here i think they're bound to to push the social services a little bit do you think it's worse today than it was maybe fifty years ago uh yeah i think maybe it is i and i think that's not necessarily the fault of immigration but just the way the world is going to you know what in a hand basket anyway i think that there's so many other problems especially in the cities uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah uh crime for example and i uh yeah uh i don't know i think it's all tied up together i know that the immigrant immigrant of course now Dallas has a lot of uh yeah you're probably right Asian immigrants in fact a large community of them uh-huh okay and uh they have their special problems uh oh for example crime i mentioned crime against immigrants is is a severe problem because the people that came from the southeast Asian countries don't want to call the police uh-huh yeah you know they they have fear of the police and whatnot that's right that's right it's really interesting to me because as as you as as you pointed out at the beginning here in Rochester uh now we don't have it immigration problem we don't even have a lot of immigration but on the other hand you know it's we do have uh a large influx of uh people from say Jamaica or other parts of the Caribbean that that's really you know and Puerto Rico we have a a large population from there people who have come over you know maybe in the last you know ten or twenty years uh-huh have moved here now why somebody from Jamaica want to would want to move to cold Rochester i'm a little uh i'm a little hard pressed to understand but they do it so so you know i don't blame them to each their own but you know if you look at at a place like Rochester now now we have a large population of like second and third generation Americans of people who came you know whose parents or grandparents came to uh the United States you know people from Italy uh people from Poland people from the Ukraine um uh-huh and and i always you know i always wonder whether you know was the situation any different back then i mean how did the people who had been in the United States for for a while feel about this large amount of immigration uh it's fairly well known that at one of the major companies in Rochester who i won't say their name but i'm sure you've heard of them uh back in the thirties didn't want to hire the Italian immigrants because it it was it was a discriminatory practice huh yeah and uh you know it just makes me wonder you know and you know i look at what what made this country great and a lot of cases it was the immigrants who came over and worked and i and sometimes i wonder you know whether you know just how different is the situation today oh i think i think they want to work i think they're often under educated um-hum i think that's why maybe one reason why they have so much difficult in their own countries um-hum uh i i have trouble with  um taxes you want to go ahead sure we pay far too much in taxes well far too much for what we get i mean it's just um-hum i agree i don't know it just too too much of the money is just lost um-hum well i think uh you know when i look at um all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at it at a better discount um when you when hm you mean like those you know twenty thousand dollar toilets exactly exactly that's exactly um the whole thing when you take a look at all those issues of where our money is going and it's just as long as the the person that's spending the money uh doesn't think about oh i can go out and spend anything that i want to it's just unlimited sure it's real easy to spend other people's money right right an unlimited source so they they think well i'll go out and buy a four hundred dollar toilet seat and i could have went to Kmart and bought it for you know ten or fifteen i mean that kind of thing and uh right i don't mind them getting what they need it's just when they pay so much for it exactly it takes very you know very little to just shop around and exactly and i know a lot of uh corporations now are looking at their amount of money that's being spent and that's true they're looking at what's the best buy it used to be you could go if you had a company you had to go through certain people and you didn't care what you paid yep i mean you just got it done now people are putting in bids for things and are looking at things going to actually shop at Best Buy for Best Buy is one of our electronics stores for fax machines things like that instead of going through these office supply companies right that mark up their amounts and say you know i'll give you a legal pad for five bucks and you can go to another shop and get if for maybe sixty cents or ninety or ninety cents that kind of thing so yeah and i'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering like the world's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years except for everything keeps going up you know and i know as a middle class um you know and also i have one dependent has my daughter and i keep looking at well where's the tax so-called tax um hm uh relief for having children i mean there is none i mean i think i paid just as much as when i didn't have her yeah i know oh i know i mean i don't even you know i don't even get get to see half my paycheck between 401K and and the thirty four percent they're taking out for taxes let alone when i end up having to pay so um-hum sure exactly uh-huh exactly yeah that's the whole thing now they've gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes but you're still gonna owe the government as much money so by the end of this coming year what's gonna happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings uh account sure nope they won't be able to pay they won't be able to pay it and there'll be a lot of problems because of that you know put people into you know January or February which is always supposed to be this month after Christmas is supposed to be high spending because everything is on sale nobody's gonna have the money to spend sure none they're gonna be paying on their taxes so they're gonna have to just cut back so i don't know where the answer is and i don't and plus you know there's also like taxation without representation well i don't feel represented anymore in our government i mean it's it's certainly not a government for me they don't take care of my needs yeah yeah no no well that's the whole thing i think people are getting so fed up with it now we go through another election and listen to all these lies about the and and people don't care anymore either people people don't wanna go out to vote no no well i don't think people think they can make a difference and when you've got candidates as you do it's candidates that have money and it's backed by big business yep and big business says well we don't care about the little person and uh you know you're not going to get anymore Abe Lincolns around no but but that's that's going to backfire because um-hum well who knows uh little people who buy everything so yeah generations from now we might uh set back in our little uh rocking chairs and watch our grandchildren go through an entirely different system of things and say you know this government itself isn't working just like the communist government of uh the old uh USSR and maybe that's gonna happen to America where they'll say hey we're fed up yeah yeah i wonder though maybe it'll have to be just individual state tax and each state take care of itself and no government type of uh you know where you have to pay out to federal or whatever i don't know who knows but yeah i'm not i don't know i can't think of any easy answers to it but somethings has to happen i mean um-hum i'm certainly fed up with it yeah everybody is in fact i'm not sending in my tax money  have you had that experience recently recently i can't really say recently but i think about um about a year ago um i bought a product from some company down at uh in Atlanta Georgia i believe it was one of these um one of these um mixers these like these juice machines and uh oh yeah the um the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine it looked you know perfectly okay but i found that um it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting um after even you know despite you know diligent washing it it just it got rusty after about um three weeks of use and i don't think it was my fault because you know i had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it but uh it was really um it was i had to send it back after like you know the third week because i realized it was like it was not something was very very wrong with the blade uh how about you well i don't have so much trouble with products as service um-hum i don't feel like that's as big a problem i've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because i've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly um-hum and i'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent um-hum um the one i have now is okay most of the time um-hum but that's it but that's that's probably the worst my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her that's guaranteed uh James Avery i don't know if you have that up there but it's it's a very good company that sells sterling silver things and um-hum um-hum uh she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now um-hum and the catch broke and she was sitting in school on a carpet and when she stood up it caught and broke and we took it back and they said oh this was just obviously yanked um-hum this was yanked i mean they were so rude about it right and so we wanted a different kind of catch and she said well it's not guaranteed and i said well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed so do it anyway so we got the kind we wanted um-hum and i was really disappointed with that i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable um-hum and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and i called there to see if they had it and the lady was very nice and i said my goodness i said you've been very nice what's your name and she told me and i said well i really appreciate it i said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store and it turned out she was the assistant manager so well at least your talking to somebody who counts right so i felt kind of good about that you know i didn't even know the person's name that had gaven me the hard time or anything but um-hum right i just felt like well at least i did something maybe they'll fix it they might work on that you know right right but i find attitudes are more of a problem service is more of a problem i find up here in the Northeast we have um well we we have these mail order companies like LL Bean and uh they are famous for i guess really having really top notch service they've got um i mean i've i've really i i have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally i've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year wear it for a year and a half and even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition and they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore um they'll they'll actually do things like this i mean they're really they they go they bend over backwards servicewise for you i've um that's really great i've found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call i guess if you if you call the eight eight eight hundred number um if you you can call up eight eight eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get um the eight hundred number uh the customer service support line for a number of companies and um actually i've tried that out with a few companies lately and they've most of them have been pretty good but i i was one reason why i like i buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that uh if you buy through Bean or though um i guess Bean's one of Bean's big competitors is Lands' End out in uh i guess it's Wisconsin somewhere they they are um they're very good about um insuring like the customer's always right and you know no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they are very understanding and uh they usually get you know they they make things very they make sure make sure things are set properly if you're in any way dissatisfied with their merchandise that's really good it used to be like that but i don't think most places are like that anymore um-hum yeah well i think i guess nowadays with the uh with the economy the way it is i guess there was a there was a story on the news tonight about how because a lot of companies are um you know things are getting rough out there there's a lot of you know the the morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn like you know of course makes you  yeah uh so the thing is i traveled to uh i traveled all over uh South America a few years ago when i was in college and uh ah picked up a lot of history and uh and uh a lot of cultural knowledge from that experience uh have you had any experience with it or have you read or have you any interest in it well i've i've spent uh i spent three years in the Orient but i uh as how shall i say it living on their level but and but i've never been uh to South America so well it was interesting for me i hadn't taken much uh history or any classes or anything on it at school and uh the person i was traveling with knew a lot about it uh and she kind of explained a lot of things that were going on there but uh uh it was interesting to to see a lot of uh the history and how they've sort of developed into some of the patterns that each of the countries have been through when i was traveling around down there the the thing that that i uh i guess i could could say that i know how none i know how America comes across to other countries from my uh time in the Orient uh uh-huh and i know that uh so i i guess i can extrapolate it a little extrapolate a little bit and say that that uh might makes right and money makes right and uh uh i'm sure that the perception in other places is that these guys are a bunch of bullies uh yeah i think that uh i think that particularly applies down there uh it uh there was a perception particularly in Brazil and Argentina that the United States had was really to blame for a lot of the economic oppression that was suffered down there because uh something like after the war we gave all sorts of special trade preferences to Europe to help them recover and completely ignored the South American beef and uh-huh and what other industry they had down there and they suffered greatly for that even though they had these great products for export you it was sort of the United States that was kind of choosing their fate you know who would make it and who wouldn't well i i and yet i can see part of that because uh how shall i say it my impression of Latins has been governed by when i grew up in California and certainly here you are in Texas uh uh my impression of Latins was was totally uh colored by the fact that i there were a lot of uneducated Mexicans and uh i think most Americans you know all the stereotypes are that the they call them banana republics and things like that so that the stereotypes are that that uh they don't know what they're not very well educated when i was the the flip side of that is yeah that uh in my twenties uh well when i was in in Hong Kong i found uh uh i i met some people who were totally white blonde haired people from i think it was Uruguay yeah and uh so they told me a little about they said well this is you know it it's very European country and uh then i met uh after i got married i met a woman from uh Mexico City whose vocabulary she didn't speak English at all that her vocabulary was incredible even though her pronunciation was uh a little rough huh yeah and i talk and i heard her give a speech one time and i i uh she was got all over me because uh she said you're you're equating the fact that my accent uh that i have a Spanish accent with no vocabulary and so i guess what i'm leading up to is to say that i'm sure they're getting very tired of us not taking them seriously yeah uh in fact a lot of those same sort of stereotypes impressions i had before i traveled around down there and one of the things i learned was that there is an incredible amount of diversity uh especially from country to country but even within countries you know you you've got uh uh different races uh in in the Andean countries you have a big uh Indian race you know and and Mexico has a lot of that and that's why you know you get sort of the Spanish Mexicans who who aren't really as common that you see in the United States and uh-huh and the uh the the poor uh ethnic uh you know Indian uh uh races and cultures and everything and there's a there's a big mixture and then like Brazil has uh a lot of African people of African descent and all different races and and then you you deal with a lot of issues that are sort of even a microcosm of of the racial issues in the United States where like people in Argentina  well uh my opinion on taxation well could being in New York state where taxes are high and services are low hm i guess i'd have to say i don't think we're getting our money's worth as far as uh the tax system is concerned i think a lot of it is going to waste on uh services services that aren't necessary and uh out-of-date ideas that just don't make sense anymore in these times yeah i i have to agree i'm uh right now i'm in Atlanta in Atlanta but i grew up and am from uh Utica New York so uh i understand and i agree with the uh New York situation situation hm yeah it's as a matter of fact they recently in our county here our state sales tax has been seven percent right pretty much forever well they've just decided now when our county where i am is looking at upping the tax rate to eight percent to try and close a deficit uh that they've found in the county budget here and uh right you know between the increases in the sales tax and of course we have the high state tax right now we have to look into the possibility of you know it if it isn't from the Bush administration with user fees it's more direct taxation right i don't know what the taxes are like down in Georgia well it's um it's kind of tough to tell i haven't really got no good feel for it yet the um i've been down here for only like six months so it um they're not i don't think they're quite as bad as they are in New York state i guess is my opinion right now um there is like there are there's a tax on food here which is you know a little bit different because they don't have that up there and and other than that right now they're starting to realize that their taxes are low but they also realize that they still have to make sure their roads are paved and so on so they're starting to talk about um raising like instead of registering or uh getting your license which costs five dollars now they decide to well maybe we should charge forty dollars for it well they just did that up here too it Mario Mario raised it right up here um considerably and you know we've had our road road road taxes and gas tax the gas tax was such a Utica boondoggle being from Utica you probably yeah um remember when they put that into effect and how that was going to save our roads and what it did is it all went to New York City to refurbish that subway disaster yeah that would right of course of course no that seems like we're in from New York state i guess you're you're pretty much your main concern is yes you sit there and to allow um you know taxes like crazy and all you do is see all the money go in a big funnel towards New York City well yeah it's you you know roads this year have been especially bad they um here in Rochester they've now because to save tax money and that they have turned off the expressway lights at night oh yeah um-hum yeah they've been talking about doing that here too but they haven't they've almost been able to push it through but people started complaining and well they just shoved it through here and you know to hell with people and uh put it into effect and then suddenly of course you know ever since every day in the newspaper here it's yeah people complaining you know well it was only saving two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year it's just we're paying good tax money for this and yeah they turned it off yet they're still giving money to all these bizarre things in New York City the roads aren't any better here right right and uh even the town here where i am in um the taxes have increased again i mean they just can't push property taxes any higher that's why they're looking at this sales tax business now yeah yeah that's down here they're um that i'm amazed at the one cheap thing down here is gas i'm not sure what the price is up there but that down here it's only like eighty nine cents per per gallon oh that's not moving you know that Mario up here is we're i just filled up tonight it was a dollar it's a dollar fifteen nine a gallon yeah i was home over at Christmas break and it was i saw the gas prices and it was like boy what a switch well you know we also have a somewhat of a monopoly here of the gas suppliers you know anywhere else in the state it's uh probably a nickel less but they say it's going to increase around the summer time to a dollar twenty five up here yeah oh sure yeah which is insane yep well as soon as they get near Memorial Day people start traveling and everyone knows it so we've got to raise the gas prices yeah so oh well it's it's it's interesting topic coming two days from tax day yes i know i and i just i actually had filed earlier and i got my refund tonight actually small but small but uh i got it back anyway yeah we're we're just sitting down tonight to get ours filled out we're going to do it we're going to do it and we're going to get we were doing software to do it and then you know put off put it off put it off oh oh yeah yep now tonight being two days left yeah well it's pretty pretty frustrating when you see the whole situation it doesn't seem as though okay  well we in in in our family have been pretty remiss in trying to uh you know keep track of uh daily finances uh the uh way way back what twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer i did what everybody else does which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks and you know checkbooks and all those kind of thing and we kept that going for about a month and it became so onerous that we gave up on it um-hum that sounds about right you know so uh the only thing we're you know that we do now is uh i keep a a little spreadsheet of uh what i call the net worth calculation which is just the the present value of various kinds of investments and so forth uh and i only update that oh i don't know maybe once every quarter or so every three months just basically when the statements come in um-hum you know just to see whether or not we're falling you know getting ahead falling behind or staying staying even or what right um that's really about you know the extent of uh of the kind of uh financial score keeping that we're doing uh well it's kind of difficult for me because right now um like most teachers i'm laid off hm oh dear that's terrible and so um i spend most you know i substitute a lot uh-huh so it's a lot it's very hard on a nonfixed income because i don't know how many days i'm going to be called in and whether i am or not to try to keep track of finances uh-huh and but i know uh how much i have to bring in a month and that's about it that's about as far as we go and then anything extra is you know more or less split up between all of us uh-huh and just thrown in the kitty more or less for a rainy day oh i see are you are you married are you living with a bunch of with with people you're sharing expenses um no i'm a single mother i have three children oh i see uh-huh so uh right now we're on we get from you know aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it and my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support oh dear so right now i know what i'm getting from the state and um i have to balance more or less what i get from the state with my bills and um you know try to work as many days as possible um-hum any time they call me in but i still have to figure out if i work too many days then i lose all my state aid and if i don't work enough days then i don't get enough to meet the bills and it's like a juggling act every single month um-hum like this week i've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation i see so you know the four days before they only have a four day week and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in uh-huh i oh i see they don't like to be absent before a vacation oh sure but we're shopping around as far as well i'm shopping around as far as trying to get uh that's why i'm doing this to get some extra money uh-huh and um getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts my kids are in Boy Scouts so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts because every penny i bring in is ten percent to me so it sort of helps defray the costs a little bit but you know we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul i guess we're in the situation that a lot of Americans you know middle class Americans are in uh-huh yeah you're the first you know uh my next door neighbor just lost his job in a you know one of these uh his company went broke oh my Lord i mean went you know bankrupt actually it was a subsidiary of a of an outfit called US Shoe or something it was a computer subsidiary i don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company really but uh you know they just they just folded it up and um um told him to that they took the top management and gave them jobs um-hum with the with the corporate uh at the corporate front office and everybody else was sent packing ah uh hang on one second i've got sure um somebody somebody was knocking on my door here um it sounds like in a certain sense at least at the present stage i mean it sounds sounds terrible to say but at the present stage you probably are even more in the market for a a budgetary thing than than than most people probably are might be terms of keeping keeping score of input and output right um-hum definitely do you have a computer do you have a computer at home or uh yes we do and we try to you know i keep track of every penny and more or less enter it in you know every single day i'm at the computer uh-huh uh-huh i see and it's like okay what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month what hasn't come in yet you know um-hum yeah have you do you use a standard uh a standard spreadsheet or i mean  okay i'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as a has been so oh so well it let's put it this way we've got the New England Patriots up here so oh yeah right well they've had some serious problems in the past couple years really why yeah um well uh partly due to ownership you know uh Victor Kiam owned the uh the Patriots uh for a period of a number of years and uh-huh he always had this uh this wonderful quality of quality being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something and uh they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth and it recently was sold to uh some other people so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and uh keep uh the Patriots in the New England arear anyways yeah well it'll be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you oh yeah i've been to a couple of i've been to a few games before uh-huh now you you're you're from Texas so you've got two football teams down there right well it depends on where you're from in Texas i live right by Dallas so we have one football team as far as we're concerned that's how it's is it's divided yeah it really is so uh-huh oh i see there's that type of segregation huh wow we've got our Cowboys here and and uh i don't think anybody roots differently uh-huh do you but i have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno and he is for the L the uh Raiders LA Raiders so um-hum do you follow professional sports at all well i just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didn't do very well but i've been trying more this year i think i know a little more than i used to i never knew very much at all so yeah i'm trying well it's it's a good past time yeah you know particularly football they say uh it football attracts more men because of the you know you the you see the the physical aggression on the field and supposedly psychologists say that uh that um men take out their frustrations by watching football and you know they get together with a bunch of guys and they um uh and they have a good time and everything and that's suppose to be some of the uh male bonding and the and the uh the male instincts i guess or something about uh so i shouldn't even try to do it huh well no it's a it's good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest i think that uh i personally like hockey better because it has contact it's a contact sport it has the speed yeah right and the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey not everybody can play hockey yeah so we and that's we're a big hockey area up here hotbed up here in New England as well as you know in in the Minnesota area but really i don't even think we have that in Texas but we might do we what hockey i mean no you probably know i don't know nobody talks about it so i don't think we do no there's no hockey there's no there's no professional hockey teams in in in in Texas it just it's no uh-huh and we have a soccer team that comes and goes we don't even have that very much so yeah i think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now like they have this World Football League um-hum you see we have the NFL that that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and LA Raiders and those teams there are those teams that play in professional the National Football League yeah but uh now they have what's called the World Football League and they have all these teams from there's a team in London and there's a team there's a there's a uh teams in other European teams and there's teams in the United States oh and and and they're playing now during the summer months and it's really you know overkill you know there's only so much football you can watch oh yeah yeah well i like to do i don't like to watch i don't like to watch anything yeah that's good so it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a TV and watch all this stuff i think it's an excuse to do nothing and i i can see what you're saying about the male bonding and the guys get together and that's kind of cool that's fun you know yeah um-hum but it can get really overdone now have you ever been to a professional football game yeah i have yeah yeah i have have you did you do the whole big the the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole uh no actually no um well see now see now that's what you got to do see now we talked our wives i've done that for college football yeah yeah yeah you the same well the same thing we we talked our wives there's about six or eight guys that we used to go out for these games and uh we talked our wives into going with with us one time and they had a real good time and it was basically for the social atmosphere yeah right and that's the thing yeah you go you know three or four hours before the game you go set up we set a table up we do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more yeah but but that whole it it's not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself but it's the whole atmosphere of playing uh of going to a game yeah it that you miss sitting home in your parlor you know uh with a with a a six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know you you miss that and and any professional sport i think you miss that that's right yeah that's right uh-huh the atmosphere of being there you know yeah well in high school i went to every football game and well i twirled you know and i you know i didn't i still don't know that much about football obviously but i still had a good time you know i yep well football  all right have you ever been to a family reunion i go to a family reunion every year religiously it's the well i come from Iowa oh wow tell me about that my mother was one of nine children in the family uh seven of those children are still living and uh the family has grown of course and we get uh about a hundred and fifty people a year wow that show up at this family reunion i had come from a large like i say a large family i had forty four first cousins on my mother's side and we all know each other pretty well and and uh so it's a wonderful occasion when we get together and we don't see everybody each year but you know alternate years we get to see most everybody is uh so what makes the reunion a good reunion oh what do they do i mean they can be real boring i've i've been to a couple as a kid well you have to go with the right spirit of course uh i think what makes our family reunions so good is that we there is so much love that is shared there uh okay so you must keep in touch with each other um other than at the reunion is that right well yeah many of us do actually uh i'm in my fifties now and my mother came from a generation where the only option was writing okay postcards letters whatever uh-huh uh and she used to correspond with her sisters quite religiously and they with her so and of course that older generation still always sends all of us Christmas cards and it's wonderful you know yeah yeah that's so uh but it it ours is the type of family if i had no place to be i could call anyone of my aunts or my cousins and they would say come and stay with me for a few weeks oh wow that is good so when so when you guys have your reunion uh um-hum it's now i'm sure that sounds like you guys are pretty satisfied what about your your uh how how what do you do for the kids oh well uh these attitudes are projected down to the kids that this is the place where we really want to go and and we can have a good time it's not a boring thing uh i guess once in awhile about thirteen or so maybe it's a little boring for them yeah if if they haven't been there enough years to have formed friendships but my kids went every year and therefore they knew you know a lot of the other kids uh-huh so then you kind of look forward to seeing some of these second cousins once a year we do go to uh it's Clear Lake Iowa where we hold it and we make every effort in the world to get the shelter house so we have a facility where we can be inside but yet the kids can go and be in the lake if they want to is is uh and and how do you allocate uh i mean how do you decide when you're going to meet and oh and that's set it's going to be it's always the first Sunday after the Fourth of July oh okay well the first Sunday after the Fourth of July has got to be hot right oh it is but then you can't find any time in Iowa when it's not hot in the summertime that's what i meant could be the springtime or something like that the kids are still in school then huh oh yeah uh-huh well okay but Iowa is very agricultural and spring is not a good time to try to do anything i see because so many were involved with agriculture so so do you have a reunion well my kids my parents uh used to have reunions and and uh we'd go and and uh actually i kind of remember it as a lot of as a lot of fun but it's been very tough to talk my kids into the idea of meeting any of the relatives uh i don't know exactly why that's true i think part of it's because they're oh uh they just don't know anybody and we our family is all scattered out we started in California but uh now everybody's all over the United States these days uh-huh well you know with as many people as we have we're all over the US too but uh i yeah i i know that there's a difference but i haven't quite even even locally uh i i guess i've got a brother that lives uh about a five hour drive from here and i haven't seen him for twenty years so that tells you something about my oh my what did you say your first name was Ralph but it's Ralph uh Ralph shouldn't act like that no no i shouldn't i'm uh i have to admit that it's but when i hear these uh well of course i was the last of eight see oh okay the very last of eight and my parents were both married before and and uh so i only have half brothers and half sisters so that's i guess that's part of it they were all grown by the time i came along and uh oh i see i shouldn't say all grown but anyway it's it's one of those uh um i was always the you're their kid you're their kid and i'm not saying they're not nice but but uh you you know we don't have those stories okay there's difference yeah uh-huh real close uh uh i was always the little kid i'll put it that way so that's and then the other side of it and the other thing too is that my parents uh uh my dad had five kids  an avid camper um i'm a more of of a wanna be uh-huh uh my wife uh uh was an only child but her family all through her adolescence had a uh small pull behind trailer so they didn't go out necessarily camping in tents and such but they did a lot of weekend um trips all through the midwest and the east uh Lancaster Pennsylvania and so forth and so on they did a lot of traveling with that so if you count that as camping which may some people may or may not um she had a lot of experience with that and when we first uh got engaged and got married we you know kind of hung around did a lot of stuff with her folks uh till they sold sold the trailer and then finally they passed away but don't have a whole lot of experience or opportunities to but we're we're all kind of wanna-bes here at the family there is sort of a wide range of camping opportunities i remember when i was a kid my only my only camping experience was when i was about thirteen or so and it the Y camp used to have an overnight every so often um-hum and we'd cut down a couple of saplings or you nowadays you wouldn't cut down saplings i guess yeah i mean i know what you mean and we'd lash them up which lash was tying and we'd make sort of a triangular thing and you know with a tarp over the top sure there you go and um sleeping bag dug a hole made a fire uh the old shovel with the toilet paper over it so that i think that's real legitimate camping uh just recently uh my husband and i and our kids joined a friend whose parents has one of the have one of these big Silver Bullet trailers that stay parked in upstate New York and um-hum i chuckled when i got there there was a microwave oven and a gas burner stove and five bunk beds and heat for the evening i mean um-hum um-hum that's that's more like a mobile home yeah but it was so big that you know they don't use it mobilely it just you know you you pull it somewhere and you leave it there it's sort of like a summer house i guess and i guess that's camping too um not a camper uh-huh yeah i guess my kid you know my kids go to the YM um or go to the uh girl scout camp uh there are several of them here in southwest Ohio that are all run by the same uh council and they're usually there for a week each during the summer at some point so they're they do a lot more rustic camping but most most of their meals are served in the mess hall i think they have one or two outings where they cook at the campsite um out in the fringes of the uh of the park rather than uh than at the than at the um mess hall so they get some of it um-hum the only other opportunity really that i get anything like that is uh in the summer um i'm a ham radio operator and oh tell me about it you ready for Dayton oh can't wait uh like a pilgrimage to Mecca right but it's and it's very convenient for me because it's only forty five minutes up the road uh-huh but um for field day which is an exercise in the summer where ham it know it's it's it's a couple of things it's supposed to be a uh a demonstration of how the ham community can be mobilized to to operate under simulated emergency or field conditions i think i've heard something about this you go set up a tower right yeah where well some people set up towers other people use a fishing line and pull wires up into trees and use wire antennas or whatever depending on how energetic the club is but uh um-hum you know it it's also a contest see how many other ham stations you can contact who are doing the same thing and then it's also a chance to get out with your buddies and drink beer and play radio all night or if if you you know we have a number of women in the club also but it's you know it's a chance to get out with your friends and drink beer and play radio all night but we do go out to one of the local city city municipal whatever parks um here in Cincinnati and uh you know go up on top of a tall hill and string some wires up in the trees and such and um put out the picnic tables and uh lawn chairs and set up the equipment with a generator and set up a tent for the kids to sleep in or for the people who are who are uh taking a break to to go off and sleep in and then use propane stove to cook breakfast at six o'clock the next morning with and that's about as close to camping as i really have much of a chance to get right now uh right i mean you know there's not that much free time and i don't know uh we we we daydream about going camping i guess uh there's a very nice state park around here um that we're on Long Island um-hum oh um-hum and um near Montauk if you've ever heard of it the big light house out there there's a beach state park where you can you know they have tent sites i guess we'd have to rent all that stuff and um and there's picnic tables and there's the beach and i guess it's pretty popular it's sort of a um a lottery for who gets it and you have to apply at the right time and people in the know how do that and we keep thinking about doing it and it  well Brad what do you hear in San Jose about Ross Perot do you hear as much do you think as we do here in Dallas um probably not in anywhere near as much there have been a couple of articles uh which i've basically glanced at um but that's about it i just find it interesting that somebody with that much money uh would be interested in the presidency in the first place i guess it's it's as much you know just the sense of power and the sense of being able to accomplish things uh as much as anything else i don't know it seems to me that if i had that kind of money i would feel like i were more influential as a private citizen than as the president well that could be uh Ross Ross Perot is not a politician i mean this is kind of new to him um-hum i i don't know are you familiar with things that he's done in the past that have gotten quite a bit of attention like uh rescuing the EDS employees that were being held in jail in Tehran hum no no i hadn't i hadn't really paid that much attention yeah i mean this was this was a few years ago probably ten or so ten or twelve uh-huh uh he hired uh some retired Army guys to go in after him and and supposedly even i think went in by himself with went in to see them disguised you know as somebody else wow but uh he at least ended up over there in one of the neighboring companies probably countries probably Afghanistan or something to meet them when they came out of uh out of Iran and i think he was uh maybe a little getting a little bit involved in politics or something during the Vietnam war he uh tried to send supplies over to the prisoners um-hum and i don't know i of course we hear a lot of him because he lives here in the Dallas area what kind of i mean this this obviously says something for his um you know something for one aspect of his character what kind of person is he in terms of i he was an outstanding salesman at IBM i've read until he quit there and started his own company which he later sold out to General Motors and um-hum and uh it since then he's started a new company but i think he must be a very good salesman or at least he was at some time um my impression is that he's a pretty honest person be kind of a change oh i i've heard him on the radio and whatnot i mean he just seems very forthright he he he doesn't have to play games yeah he's already he's already won i mean that he that's right that's right i i'm just curious to see what's gonna happen to the political scene uh if he gets on the ballot in all the states and whatnot do you do you think he cans be a spoiler for Bush um-hum um i honestly don't think so uh not unless he really puts a lot of effort into it and i don't think he wants to i think it's uh i think being a seriously considered being seriously considered as a presidential candidate is something that um it it just takes a really huge investment in personal effort not just you know i mean i'm sure it takes a lot of money as well oh yeah but um just in terms of the number of personal appearances that you've got to make and all the the the hoops that you've got to jump through in order to get the media sound bites and get people paying attention to you i mean all the backslapping an occasional newspaper article will will show up for for any variety of things but being considered seriously i think is you know may take more than he's willing to put into it yeah uh yeah yeah could be could be i i also suspect that one aspect of his personality would be that he would be really really tenacious hum or or maybe stubborn even i don't know so i don't know you know he he might decide to go whole hog and really go out and and turn into a politician and do all the back slapping and and uh handshaking and all that kiss a few babies i suppose yeah well i don't suppose he'd have to do a whole lot of fund raising or uh worry a whole lot about where the funding was coming from so he'd have that advantage yeah yeah yeah it's um certainly different i mean Bush is wealthy um-hum but nothing like that yeah i i mean i don't know what they put Perot's wealth at i think it's probably a few billion or something i yeah i've i've i've heard it in the billions i didn't hear specifics i figured once it you know once it reaches that point it doesn't really matter how many numbers are in front of the B you know it yeah it's passed it's passed any kind of reasonable imagining in the first place so yeah well i the in a way i i'm interested in his candidacy i'd like to i'd like to kind of get  well the the question was talking about the juries and um one of the things i thought about was on a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders that um maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again um so that um a judge i think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day right i i kind of agree with that because i think in some cases uh the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed right uh i i think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case right so a a judge you're right should have the whole dossier of the criminal there and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better prison position to give an appropriate uh sentencing um-hum yeah see i agree with you um one thing i heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court i mean it's supposed to be all legal and everything uh you go and you present your case the other side presents their case and you're done with it it's almost like the Night Court we see on TV um and um but it's not that we have uh such it didn't backlog or all of the uh the cases that are uh all ready pending um-hum um so i that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way in other words not not there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial yes yes Now i i i don't there's there's a point on which we don't agree i would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a anytime a um-hum one of the parties wants one and i usually it's the defendant i guess that wants to have the jury hear the case um-hum sure so i'm i'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we uh take that you know that would require a change in the Bill of Rights i believe and so oh yes and and i wasn't i didn't mean that i i didn't mean that no because i mean gee whiz if i was uh uh didn't have that right you know not to have a jury that oh yes i would feel um oh oh okay you're right that my civil rights had been violated but i meant for some when both parties agreed that yes we're going to have a judge here we're not going to have a jury you know let's get it over with sort of like car accidents you know right well i think that's all ready possible i think that you can waive the right to a jury trial uh yeah right right yeah so i agree that that should be encouraged you know people should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to um-hum to clients unless they feel they can you know tweak a jury into perhaps right giving a different sentence giving a different sentence or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher uh you know awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the the award um-hum the take right right yeah and i suspect it in cases like i guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil is that right well i i it we're at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as it's all on the same theme um-hum yeah well uh um in the case of civil civil uh things i think maybe the the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer's advantage and i think that may be where jury use is overdone you know i mean there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently but the lawyers are really right right uh it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible so uh i was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases um-hum uh-huh not just sentencing in in a criminal cases uh uh-huh i'm not so sure i'm in favor of that but i am in favor of it for criminal cases so there's a difference of my view there for those two right right yeah but well you can tell i haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that and well i was called once when i was nineteen and um have you ever had to serve jury duty uh-huh but i was doing so many other things that they took took pity on me and i was doing school and things like that they they let me out and i've never had to it since and that was almost twenty years ago uh-huh uh-huh it it isn't sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in uh that would have been about uh twenty years too um uh just last year and uh-huh uh the case i heard was a criminal case and it seemed it really trivial it involved two bicycles we didn't do the sentencing the judge did um-hum huh so how interesting we'd we uh rendered a verdict and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing uh-huh uh-huh and that was here in Wisconsin so i i don't know if that varies from state to state or if it varies  actually you know i've been involved in electronics a long time uh in computers and i have have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home oh yeah uh up until i guess maybe about a year and a half ago i got one for my son a a Macintosh Macintosh uh LC it's a real easy to use color uh um-hum computer and i got a very nice printer that goes along with it and he uses it for his school work um-hum well i've i'm currently in school so i've i've had an IBM clone i guess for a couple of years now which i've been trying continually upgrading i guess and uh i've found i've found that i pretty much become addicted to it and i can't really i've found that most of homework assignments um at the level i'm at really require some sort of computer uh simulation or analysis so hm it it's pretty very essential for me schools have them um but lot of times it so difficult to get on them at school it's very easy it it's much more convenient to have one at home where you going to school at Georgia Tech i see yeah so in engineering yes actually so that explains what all the uh computer assignments yeah it's uh well do you use your PC for things other than explicit computer work um sure i have some games of course which i play on there and uh um i have a program which allows me to access a a weather data bank so i can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby so it it provides other means other than just strict uh you know computations and so on so have you do you have a computer for yourself at home no no i just have one for my son and i really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for home home computing oh yeah yeah at work at work uh that i'm a technologist uh and i in the past have done a great deal of of uh system development just through uh software development programming um-hum uh but now i find myself using the computer even the computer at work is primarily a um word processing system and a communication system yeah yeah do you use E-mail and like that yes E-mail is probably pulls down a third of all my time yeah it's i i uh i have a modem in my computer so i can log into the system the uh network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful but um yeah that's that and word processing is while i tend to i mean obviously i do most of my almost all of my report writing on on my computer uh whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments um-hum so it's it's really become i don't know really become a mainstay i guess i can't even remember actually i don't think i've ever used a typewriter in in my life to do a um to do a report because my family when i was growing up we got a a basic computer a a TRS eighty when they first came out um-hum and i even used that to do my first reports when i was in junior high so hum well i'm a old-timer i did my Master's thesis on uh a typewriter oh yeah uh i rented an IBM Selectric oh and it was a pretty big deal yeah it it must have been tough it's a little bit strange for me i i did my Master's thesis uh last year and i did that all on a computer and it seems seems like i just can't imagine how people did it before it must have been just so much so much work yeah it uh well you know it's just it was just a completely different world then yeah so um so you you you used uh your son's Macintosh then uh do you do you find it do you like that stuff kind of computer i like it yeah i like it from a distance really i i see the packages on it uh that are available and it's nice i really don't use it myself um-hum um i when i come home from work i i like to stay far away from computers and electronic things yeah hm uh so i let my son do it and yeah uh of course you know there's uh there's an intellectual evolution taking place where it's it's it's sort of a joke but it's really true the old-timers even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like VCR's and whatnot and the kids they just take to it like candy yeah well if if if the if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge i think you know for a lot of kids that
