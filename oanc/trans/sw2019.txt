 okay the car if i buy a car it'd probably be an American made car that's what's with me wrong because i feel of the economy i would probably buy an American made car even though sometimes the foreign cars are better but we're losing a lot of money buying foreign cars and people getting out of jobs as it is so i'd probably buy i've always own American car uh the kind of car is probably something i couldn't afford like a Lincoln i would love to have a Lincoln uh-huh mark seven a Mark seven yes uh what do the Mark sevens usually run oh about thirty five to forty thirty five K uh-huh well there's a tremendous amount of money alright it's a luxury car it's a it's a sports luxury car it's right below the Continental the Lincoln Continental i see you know it's it's along that line um-hum i agree about that uh American cars should be the ones to be bought um i just wish their quality would to still improve further yeah they're getting even better i think oh yes it's a matter of time it's probably going to be another two to five years before they're really up to par where they should be and then i believe the majority of American people will yeah already have foreign cars yeah uh-huh they will already have in fact i have one myself i'm reluctant to admit i don't my mother has one she does yes she finally she wanted she had a she's got a a Honda um not a Honda a Toyota that what is it Accord no Honda Accord yeah Honda Accord yes that's one and she hasn't had any problems out of it see what year model is it oh think it's a eighty nine eighty nine uh-huh well that's fairly new mine mine is an eighty four Sentra uh-huh and the only problem i've ever experienced major type problem i've experienced is a a fuel pump had to be replaced and it's got eighty four thousand no it's got eighty nine thousand miles on it now see i have a i have a Lincoln Continental right now you do it's a yeah it's a seventy nine Lincoln it's got over a hundred thousand miles and there is no problem with the car see the i think no major malfunctions then huh-uh huh-uh my air conditioner went out but i mean ten years but uh i mean as far as major there's nothing major with the car i see well that's good to hear but it i think what it is the American public had made good cars at one time and then they started more or less trying to hurry stuff the first car i think now that they have that's uh that's made it on the what do you call it the mechanic's list or the the why they check the how they judge cars what is it list where they come out with the consumer list in Consumer Digest or a Consumer Reports yeah is a is a is a Taurus a Taurus yeah that's the first one that's made it and uh its a you know it's a four door it's a nice car now for me to buy a Taurus i would have to buy top of the line Taurus and that's Taurus Show uh-huh it's it's it's it has a four speed i like that stick shift but see that's top of the line that costs twenty whereas a Taurus would cost about a regular Taurus i think is twelve or thirteen well that's not too bad in price listing huh-uh the the yeah see the Taurus Show has the spoiler kit and the and the big engine and the and stuff like that it has an eight cylinder it has the well yeah i think it has the it has that engine like the Mustang oh yeah yeah and it's a four it's i think it's you know the speed uh uh manual transmission correct so but yes i would definitely buy one of those before if i had to between that and Lincoln i'd probably buy the Show Lee Iacocca stressed on the mini van uh i mean the mini van has been one of the best top of the line vehicles for Chrysler isn't it yeah um i don't know their durability is a lot better i understand than most other vans i think it would it's not so much of the vans any more or the cars some of them are ugly right i'm sorry they look like space mobiles there's a lot of uh duplicity in the vehicles the way the build them too uh-huh insofar as their design um uh American even foreign but i'm sure it's all for streamlining or for air streamlining yeah why you can't still go fast so what's the difference that's what i don't understand you know they're making it so that they're talking about the wind current and how how efficient it is but if you can't go fast you can't go fast i don't care how sleek they make it it just makes sense to me It's like they're making a a model of a speed car when you can't go fast right you know the in in Germany it would probably be alright if you put it on that autobahn but over here nobody should be going that fast to be worried about wind no uh yeah just a second going to pick them up excuse me for a moment right i'm fixing to get them right now excuse me i had to uh talk to my boss i know how that go but i guess that's about it and i better let you go okay so i guess we have nothing to do on the other end there's no uh interruptions here to tell us that we're done or uh-huh that's it just hang up all righty bye okay later come here  you uh uh we are latecomers my husband and i to the world of golf we started when we were both oh i would imagine he was fifty years old so we've not been at the game that long but we love it oh well good so you're a player then instead of a spectator then uh probably i am a player but certainly not a good player uh the highlight of my season is probably the four times i get under a hundred oh right so boy you're you're you're right up there about where i am then oh i see gosh i thought young people were all good on no young people like to swing real hard at the ball uh-huh so you find yourself you find yourself in the rough a lot they just hit a long way well i'm i'm getting better about hitting them straight but where i get into trouble is around the green oh my my short game leaves a lot to be desired well we we speak of the three games of golf here oh and that would be the long the short and the putt of it yes so the short of it is my weakest part uh-huh we uh often times have made a trip to Mississippi in March because of course it's still cold here in March and we always hope for warm weather down there and the people that we play with uh the men foursome are all much longer ball hitters than my husband is but he finds that by going straight down the middle he usually wins about a quarter a hole because they've been in the rough on the right and then in the rough on the left so he ends up playing just as well as they do yeah i i've you know i see that all the time as a matter of fact i live uh literally right across the street from a golf course here in Texas uh-huh and uh most of the older folks that go out there and play are exactly the same way all of us young bucks get out there and hit the ball you know a mile but it's like three fairways over yes our golf course in this small town is a beautiful course with a creek running through it so we have some water hazards and we have some sand and we have some hills um for the most part we all use carts uh battery operated carts and and most of us own our own carts uh-huh my husband happens to be on the board for the first time this year which is a new experience for him uh our membership is very inexpensive um oh boy yeah probably total cost with monthly minimum and cart storage and membership would make it about a thousand dollars a year well you can get a walking membership for two hundred dollars a year at the course down here yeah oh can you really that amazes me yeah it's an eighteen hole course i mean it's it's uh not terribly difficult and there's really there's a a river that runs along the side but it only comes into play on one par three hole uh-huh there's really not that many hazards on it but uh it's a really inexpensive course to get on i'm always amazed that uh larger areas uh they can play for what we can uh many of our friends who are transferred away from for some reason or another end up in cities that it would cost them ten thousand dollars a year to belong to a club which yeah there's a few of those here too right so do you play much no not near as much as i'd like to i mean i've i tend to stay pretty busy at my job and uh uh-huh yeah and it's hard to get on a regular schedule and then we're pretty active in our church which takes up a lot more time too so um-hum um-hum and you probably have children at home which takes up a lot more time but no we actually don't oh i see we have we have two miniature dachshunds and ten fish oh my well we're down to two cats and they don't take a whole lot of time either but we find that each fall when the season seems to be shut down here we say next year we're going to play more golf uh-huh uh this is the second summer that my husband's been retired and he did play more last year of course but we were gone a lot too uh yeah and that makes although we've played golf a lot of places around the United States uh on different trips but it's even though we started late it's certainly become a very prime part of our life in the summer time where have you have you played any in Texas never have in fact we just drove through Texas uh in mid February or late February i guess and we hoped to play while we were there we stayed overnight in a little town called Eastland Texas and wanted to play hoped to play there the next morning but it was like thirty nine degrees the next morning and very windy so we just went on to El Paso yeah it does basically though the the golf season only shuts down for maybe three months out of the year if that much you know probably not even that much because really uh-huh uh February and January were about the only two really cold months that we had it was up in the very warm temperatures even in December this year uh-huh uh-huh that would be wonderful to be able to play and of course from our town a lot of people go to Arizona or Florida for the winter and they're able to play all year round but sure yeah oh Arizona's beautiful um-hum yes i was amazed we spent the only time we played on our trip was in Douglas Arizona and uh that was just um it was just wonderful to be able to get out and hit a ball the course was not not green but it was going to be in another month when they started watering yeah so yes it's it's it's become a big part of our lives even though we're late players hey well hey you know it's never too late is what i say well i guess not well maybe you'll get to play more this year well i sure hope so uh well plan on it at least okay nice chatting with you and with you bye bye-bye  well i've kind of resisted having any pets because well i had some pets as a child uh-huh but uh now that i have two kids they're sort of like pets you have to take care of them a lot and they require a lot of time and um neatness and plus you know now that i'm married i have a husband that i do some things that you know help him uh-huh and so it seems like i have plenty things to do and so i thought that if we got a pet that that would be just one more person what kind of pet did you have as what kind of pets did you have as children well the kids you know the kids wanted the kids love all kinds of pets you know cats and dogs and things and i know some kinds of pets are more uh-huh independent and as a child i had um you know like a we had a dog and we had turtles and we had um you know small lot of the small things like i know we got a little bunny at Easter once and uh-huh uh-huh a little baby chicken and all that but they say you shouldn't do that any more but um yeah well i have um i have a cat that i've had for about eight or nine years uh-huh oh yeah and i wouldn't trade her for anything i also have a child uh-huh cat's lot easier to take care of than the child you can go away and leave her for a few days yes they can take care of themselves especially cats are pretty good about being independent yeah i've left her well i've left her alone up to about four days uh-huh because she doesn't she's real good she doesn't overeat or anything uh-huh and so i can leave food out and know that you know she only eats when she's hungry i know some people have cats that no matter how much you put down they'll eat it all oh yeah and then if i'm if i'm gone longer than that then i'll have somebody come in and um you know make sure that she has food and and fresh water usually i just leave a faucet dripping in a bowl in the kitchen and i've even she drinks out of the toilet well we just last week we got a gerbil that's a thing that i picked for the kids because they were wanting to have a pet and i i didn't want to have one i picked gerbils because uh-huh they apparently they aren't like you know they don't smell as bad as other uh well you have to keep uh if you don't keep them clean my friend had gerbils and you could smell it as soon as you walked into their her house yeah oh that's awful and i don't like that odor and um and they don't require as much but we'll see how it works out it wasn't as it's not something that um i had to like learn to yeah something that's going to be running around your house that if you're unaccustomed to that you wouldn't like such a big change and they stay in their little cage and you throw a few things in there they're not loving you know you know like a cat yeah yeah can you hold did they let you hold them or well we're just getting used to them right now we're kind of just letting you know touching them uh-huh and we've picked them up before but that was kind of scaring them pretty bad right now was it are they young do you know how old they are well they they seem like you know they were smaller compared to some of the other ones uh-huh but we we i did that i let the kids have a pet because i wanted them to have practice in caring for someone else and you know not being so selfish uh-huh how old how old are your kids they're four and five okay mine's five and i thought it would be good for them to just practice you know having someone else to care for and everything i know that a lot of pets a lot of people have pets because they make good companions and yeah friends and they do or my cat does to me like she doesn't like anybody but me in fact no one would know i had her because if anyone comes over she immediately goes into hiding uh-huh but um i i had a dog for a while before i had my son and i grew up we grew up having dogs and i'd like to have a dog but uh-huh kind of like for the same reasons as you i just the care that goes into them and you know if i you know decide to take off for a week or so uh-huh you know i can't leave a dog like i can leave a cat yeah and plus they require a lot in the way of training and which now that i'm home would probably be a good time to do it if i were going to do it but you know i just don't you know there i don't know why but with dogs it seems you have to have a lot more vet bills yeah plus they're more expensive to get yeah now my cat i've had her for eight or nine years i had her spayed and i had her declawed which you know was an initial expense but then she has not been sick one day i have never had her to the vet other than just her you know her maintenance stuff and it seems like whenever i've had a dog you know something always they're always getting sick or you know breaking a leg or uh-huh something yeah and i just i don't need that expense right now plus they eat more and expensive to maintain and keep the flea powder and the flea dip and yeah that yeah i don't know if that's such a big problem here in Dallas my cat stays inside because she's declawed so i don't really have a problem with that but yeah if you had a dog you know they need exercise and you have to walk them uh-huh uh-huh that's true they are a lot i guess that's the number one reason why i'm i'm not really ready to have a pet too much i kind of consider these gerbils just kind of something you look at not really pets just kind of things yeah they are not because they don't really acknowledge that they know you you know it's not like a pet pet a pet is someone that comes up to you and is happy to see you and that kind of thing yeah yeah yeah well they make you feel special you know i live alone with my five year old and my cat and she really does she makes me feel like she cares about me and but uh-huh you know it it gives you some strokes there that you may not get otherwise because i'm cooped up in the house all day that's true and um i would like to have what i would really like to have is an aquarium and have some really nice fish um but until i get in a place where i feel like that's where i'm going to be for a long time they're just their so hard to move a long time yes and they they take up a lot of you know good space you know kind of like a bookcase yeah now i have some friends who have aquariums and i enjoy watching the fish and looking in at them you know but that's something that you really i feel need to learn about and read about you know you need to learn how to take care of them and you need to learn uh-huh huh what fish are compatible you know and what ones you can put together and what ones you can't you know how to feed them and how to you know to clean them you know the thought of cleaning an aquarium is not very pleasing but no with filters and all that stuff that they have now i mean they're almost maintenance free yes and i noticed um that's kind of what i was attracted to these gerbils for is that they they have a certain area that they use like their bathroom uh-huh and you can just um you know rinse that out it's kind off to the side it unscrews and yeah well that's good and so you can just take it out with a garden hose rinse it out oh and you supposedly you don't have to change all of the the bedding and everything except every three weeks which is not very often well that's good yeah that's not bad i had two i managed i guess when i was in high school or junior high i managed to talk my parents into letting me have a gerbil uh-huh i won't tell you what happened to it if you just got them you don't oh no it's something awful oh poor thing part of it was my fault i guess i just didn't take care of it like i should have um well i'm hoping that it'll be a little bit of diversion for the kids and a little bit of a do they like to watch him they do and they're anxious for us to be able to hold it but i these just aren't going to be as tame as the book i got a book first uh-huh they just don't seem like um well i guess we've have them about a week now and they're just not kind of how many did you get did you get two are they male or female does that make a difference two well we hope that we got two females so that they're supposed to get along better uh-huh and they won't have any babies but you don't really know i guess we won't know unless they never have any babies really until there are about six more in the cage well you know the people that sold them go well it's hard to tell but we think and we're going oh great oh no so if they have babies then we'll have to get rid of one of them but i've heard that it that after they have babies that you have to separate the then you have to separate the male from the female or the male could hurt the babies yeah that's what i hear so i'm hoping i think they have a really quick reproduction cycle of only like thirty days or something yeah so within a month i guess or two we'll know oh no that's funny well i guess i better run go okay well it was nice talking to you yes nice and good luck well thanks and it was nice to hear that you've had such good luck with your cat yeah i i i know my cat she's reaching her life expectancy and i'm already thinking oh no  hi how are you today i'm great good well as a matter of fact i'm before we started this conversation i was working on my PC at home yeah uh do you have one no i don't have one at home i work with one on at work continually you know but i do not have one of my own at home yeah do you have what do you have at home we have an um actually it's a TI computer but it is the IBM uh-huh um clone it's not the TI PC from back when right from the the oldies but the goodies it's probably pretty close to what i have because i have the same kind of thing at work i have a three eighty six S X which is TI computer but everything in is in IBM mode so right uh-huh right right yeah that's what we have um do you use it a lot at home what do you well i really do i um am an accountant and but i work at home uh uh-huh so i use it for that quite often um so you're on it a lot uh-huh we have you know used some of it for some personal things we keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it um i since it's tax season i'm doing a lot of taxes so i do a lot of um a lot of that work on it as well uh-huh i was amazed when i took our taxes to our tax person and she works out of her home also and the uh software that does the taxes is just incredible you know i mean she just uh-huh oh it is you know i expected to go and you know drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later and you know she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little PC it was great yeah you can that's right that's wonderful i have often thought that that having one at home would be neat i just don't know if we would really use it that much you know i we really we decide we didn't decide to get one until i started working at home uh-huh then you know then we thought well we can use it for you know some personal things but it for us it really took you know a business application to justify the expense of it uh-huh oh definitely definitely i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer oh i guess probably three years ago for Christmas and so uh-huh and you know it's got some stuff on it it's got a nice little word processing software on it you know and some budgeting type things and stuff and i don't think she's ever touched it really you know it just it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home you know she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer you know so right she could just as easily do those things by hand yeah just as quickly yeah now i know my boss has bought the software um that he can that his his checkbook is on on on a disk and he goes in and prints and types his checks on the screen and then hits print and they print out on the checks and uh-huh and he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places you know oh my gosh and he just whips out you know i saw him yesterday morning over there and and he paid his monthly bills and he just you know wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print and it printed out like ten checks and he just you know they're perforated and he just ripped them off they go through just a continuous thing on the printer and huh right he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes and there they went you know and he said you know i can balance my checkbook in seconds you know because it's all in the computer you know so right and you know there's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make that's exactly right he said you know he said used to be i always sat looking for those you know he said this way there isn't any you know it does it for you so right that's true this you know there are some definitely some some advantages to it it's just a matter of like you say are the advantages does it justify the cost if you're using it strictly for personal business so right i i think in most cases i'd have to say no not unless somebody really enjoys it or right perhaps is using it for education i have a four year old son and we have some education programs that he likes a little Sesame Street one and um we have another one that plays music and he really likes that one yeah yeah as he grows up he'll be even more and more too that's right that'll be great yeah and now i think about it i guess for for kids like as they get older especially now uh-huh uh when they get to junior high school high school and even college i mean my sister went to college um started about three years ago and she had to have a a computer really i mean it was like a necessity she couldn't imagine going through college without a computer well yeah i i'm going through right now i'm you know going part time in the evenings and you know i do yeah everything has to be typed i mean they require it you have to type it you know and uh-huh right and so i'm up here you know nights and weekends you know working on the little PC on the PC up here you know typing stuff so i can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home you know if you were going to school sure yeah any more i don't even know if they have if a college kid would have a typewriter well you i don't know no i can't no and they probably used to have it i just finished a a major research paper a couple of weeks ago and i couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk where i could go back in and move stuff around and change it i probably not even no uh-huh i don't know what they used to do before they well unfortunately in our family my husband and i went through college together and then he went on and got his Master's degree while i was working uh-huh and i'm the better typist of us and we just had a regular old typewriter not even a correcting one back then it wasn't that long ago but uh-huh oh and you had to type all of his papers i typed his Master's papers and things on a typewriter oh boy to have a computer back then oh gosh oh cut your time in half at least at least i mean and then of course you have some changes to make and do the whole thing over you take out a sentence at least yeah on a computer you take it out bleep print it out fine take out a sentence on a piece of paper uh-huh you you do the whole thing over that's right that's right you know i remember when i was working in high school you know i was working in an office and right right after i got out of high school i continued working there for probably another year and we did everything on a typewriter uh-huh and we did everything on a typewriter you know everything but it's amazing you know then when where you know someone would have you type a letter oh yeah they did it right they did it right i mean they were yeah they sit there and they go is this really what i want to say and you typed it and that was it and now you know people just send it back over and over and over and over the first time yeah that's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought about because people do feel like oh well we can just change it if you need to well we'll try this out and see what it looks like yeah so right use it as a just a yeah instead of knowing what they want to say before they ever they just you know play with it and which in a way is nice to be able to do but you know it it gets a little out of hand sometimes i've seen it get out of hand up here you know where right i know oh yeah you know we've got a secretary that sits over here that's keeping metrics right now and keeping up you know of all the letters i type how many changes how many of them do i make changes on and on each letter what types of changes are they typos are they because i couldn't read it or people just change a like one word because they think it sounds better or whatever uh-huh and you know she's also keeping a percentage you know what percentage of letters am i retyping for whatever reason and there's like one week she she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed uh-huh i believe it you know and it's like you know it's ridiculous and that was that was the high week but it's running about seventy which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types you know that's uh-huh well it's good that she does that i mean bring it to people's attention well that's exactly right you know she keeps you know keeps several weeks' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show you know look this didn't really need to be changed you know this is this is ridiculous and you know changing add this time to now you know i mean that's the kind of things you know people that she's keeping and showing that this was a big waste of time it was a waste of paper it was a waste you know to change something like that so right anyway maybe you know maybe it'll it'll help in some way but i don't know there there there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative oh i have to you know without a doubt without a doubt well i would like to get one at home some day we've got a two year old son and so you know some day i would like to get even just like the video tell or something like that you know just to to be able to pull in sources sources from outside would be wonderful you know so right especially when they're in school i think they would get a lot out of it oh i do too i do too the on line um encyclopedia just sounds wonderful you know that that sounds like such a great idea you know it'd be kind of fun to be be able to play with it uh-huh oh yeah so i know my father had a PC and and when we were in high school it was always fun we could um link in and i don't even remember now what it was called but you could link in and talk to other people talk to people all over the country you know uh-huh and like you have your own little code name you know and you'd type in hi how are you and they'd type back and everybody and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time and everything everybody said right prints out on your screen as they're typing it and it was just great fun you know right it was very expensive because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance you know it was like a long distance phone call so we were each limited limited to like twenty minutes a day you know so ooh uh-huh ooh that still could add up it's oh it added up big well you know we my parents were divorced and so the time we were like visiting our father in the summer time you know so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it you know i'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations you know yeah but when you're doing the guilty father complex you know because he's not there to watch us grow you can kind of get all kinds of stuff you know yeah oh that's sad well it was nice to talk to you well yeah you too have a nice you too have a nice day bye-bye bye-bye  okay movies i've i haven't seen too many lately i have kids and we went and saw The Rescuers Down Under over the the break do do you have kids you take to movies or uh-huh no no kids yeah it's a Walt Walt Disney movie and it didn't get as you know as good a reviews as like the Little Mermaid the last one and got all kinds of Academy Awards and things last year but this one was i thought was excellent the i can't both was that the animated version yeah it's animated and i can't believe how good they're getting with their animation now it's just just the special effects you know and in this movie this there's this boy and he rescues this uh bald eagle and uh and it's a huge eagle you know wing span of twenty feet or something like that and the boy actually rides on his back and he rides through the clouds you know and you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out and it you know they're flying all over with it and i mean i know there they there must have used been computers or something for animation this day but it was just so real realistic and lifelike and good animation what a good show even better than Roger Rabbit insofar as animation well Roger was a composite one there's one there's a movie i've seen Roger Rabbit that's not a recent movie yeah but uh i enjoyed that show yeah that was made in a few i don't know several years back i guess yeah yeah latest latest one i've saw which was a mistake to go see was Lionheart had Claude Van Damme uh-huh he was he's of course uh i guess he's trained in this uh martial arts of some sort but the plot was bland the acting was bland It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to chop them up huh yeah chop them up exactly and this is supposed to be the the guy that's uh replaces Bruce Lee or whatever or or the next Chuck Norris yeah type guy or he's singular i guess you know you know how they can make any of any single one of them in a movie to be a super uh-huh superstar superstar of any sort you know but Chuck Norris of course could be just about equal if not more uh-huh um-hum and all of them i guess could be in that fashion or category hum uh-huh uh-huh it was about uh a French Foreign Legion fellow keeps trying who deserts to go help his brother's wife who got who became a widow because he was selling drugs and he got killed really uplifting huh so he deserts and goes to New York and he starts out by fighting to make money and then he moves on to L A to where that where she is to just help him out um-hum it was really i mean the Hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something i don't know yeah i haven't heard i hadn't heard much about that movie i other than it was a chop them up movie but uh well i guess that's one i won't go see well it was worth the buck i guess oh you went to the dollar movie yeah yeah they show up at the dollar movie right after they get come out you know they're usually not not that great or didn't do that great anyway let me see let me see another movie i watched uh i want to see is uh that new one uh a lot of that won all those Academy Awards this year Dances With Wolves i haven't seen that have you seen that one yet uh-huh yeah what what what i i absorbed all of that movie in one sitting uh i guess what made it so good was the cinematography cinematography the the wide open you know spaces yeah and the music and uh well it had an excellent story line Everything about it was good um-hum um i thought an excellent one too was misery with Kathy Bates and James Caan i'm not a James Caan fan but that was a well directed and acted movie is that right i'd recommend it It's a little on the violent side uh-huh but then what movie isn't anymore right right yeah our movies today it used to be X and you know and PGs used to be Rs and seems like the rating system you know is kind of switching that way a little bit well i have no objections to it It's just uh and it's a matter of your taste uh yeah yeah oh yeah it's just that yeah it's just that the rating system seems you know instead of having X now they have what NC seventeen yeah they just changed it because X had a connotation with it you know so and even on those type they don't show what you expect right a lot of those are really violent type movies right really gory um yeah that seems to be the norm of most movies but um what the hey this is America let me see let me see one movie i saw i guess it was a while back Red October have you seen that one yeah yes i have that was pretty good yeah i read the book before so i knew the story line going in but they changed some things in the movie wasn't the same i thought the book was better than the movie but i thought the movie was really good as well i always wait for the movie i don't have time to read the book yeah i don't i read about one or two thick novels like that a year uh-huh you know that's about all the time i can i can spare but that was a good show i thought you know i read about how they did uh an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine you know that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water it was it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic it all those underwater scenes yeah i thought you know it looked to me like it was a real submarine they did me to that was in the water you know that's the magic of Hollywood special effects i hear this movie F X part two coming out is uh pretty good yeah is that right did you ever see the original one i didn't it was uh you ought to rent the uh F X part one It doesn't say part one but it it's F slash X huh what's that about a uh special effects man who somehow gets involved in this um oh i'm not sure i can't remember It's been a while since i've seen it But he he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody and he has to go underground and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done hm and uh to to fool people and and things huh right and using makeup and using the all the tricks all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go uh-huh that sounds like an interesting concept but you need to rent the first one first to understand what's going on the second uh if if that is that the second one follows the first i don't know if they have the uh original actors on that first one to that one uh-huh they're supposed to be coming out with all these Desert Storm movies oh i expected those i mean Hollywood i mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there i think this summer too yeah yeah well they had some in some of those you know they i guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about Lebanese and and you know and uh-huh and Americans and they decide oh make it Iraqis and Americans you know and they just change the title and uh and reshot a few parts you know where they yeah you know where they could i guess they figured we wouldn't can't tell the difference between an actual names will not be used yeah right eventually i'm sure they will come out with the the the proper names yeah right it was such a it i guess they they'll probably come out with a lot of movies you know it was it was such a rout though you know i don't know you know they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or latest story or about or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured uh-huh Kevin Costner i understand is supposed to be play Schwartzkopf supposedly is that right i don't know that's just one of the many rumors that floats around yeah or what you read um-hum well i think we've probably pretty much used up the tape i guess yeah yeah it's been about five minutes it's been nice talking with you same and uh we'll keep on watching those movies huh talk to you on the next go around okay bye-bye adios  okay well first of all i'm gonna to tell you i i have two little kids but they're not in public school yet i i get i get that experience starting next fall with kindergarten ah yeah yeah so you haven't really uh dealt with that in a sense no but uh being one of these late in life mothers i've listened to everybody else's you know complaints as to what's what what's the matter with either their kids or the school system so i've been surprised do are do you have school age kids yeah yeah uh mine are both out of school and uh oh you know i i've in hindsight seen some things that i wished that you know i had done something about that was you know within my power or uh you know wish that in some ways we as parents had more control over such as what's happening up there you know type thing um well just over the years there were situations that um uh came up that i didn't think were fair or handled correctly or the teachers didn't seem to be teaching anything of course it's a little hard to tell from the the information that you get from your child you know they they bring things home and i was never one to believe everything my kids said you know about something um-hum they but uh still i i question the ability of some of the teachers to uh really do a bang-up job and yet others i know are just wonderful well i heard a a frightening thing actually actually i didn't hear it it was told to me or suggested to me uh that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of Texas and i think it's similar in in many other states if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage hum of uh people to teach math and sciences and somebody said well you know you could go in and and substitute teach at seventy five dollars a day and there's always going to be you know uh somebody having a need for a math or science teacher i thought Christ they're letting me in to you know this would be this would be frightening i don't know anything about it yeah that's pretty interesting because just just because you know a subject matter doesn't mean you can teach it right right and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter i don't know if i'd know how to handle that kind of a a group of kids oh yeah in fact i think that's that's one of the big problems today is the the way the kids behave or act and and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what's going on in the class and disruptive i tell you what i'm finding frightening and this comes from you know the the aging hippie near forty mother so i went through this period of supposedly you know cosmic social enlightenment i'm on i'm in the Plano school system and living in Richardson and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school um-hum and i used to think well that's wonderful you know they can get a real life experience what i'm seeing now uh in terms of kindergarten preparedness just from in in in different preschools it's like day and night and i wonder how do they handle um-hum a child who is obviously very ready and another child who doesn't even speak English let alone know her colors yeah and they're in the same classrooms and i guess also you're going to see the first of the uh crack kids starting kindergarten my God i think it'd be next year is what i'd read i thought how well how do you how do you weed those out yes some of those certainly have a lot of disabilities difficulties you know with uh all sorts of things and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases and i was listening to NPR the National Public Radio and they've quoted statistics that i just about my throat just about fell into my toes they said at the bottom of the SAT scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education oh wow yes that's encouraging yes and i and i i got to thinking back when i was teaching college chemistry the people that took took you know the lower level courses i sometimes wondered you know are they really even educatable or trainable and it my God you know uh are the rest of us who went for the big bucks you know staying out of you know where where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with these kids i don't know yeah well that's you know that's an idea maybe there need to be some radical changes made do some things that are totally different and unheard of well you you know you you sit here and you think about that at the same time you think God i just hope i don't sound like a stage mother because if right now if you ask my friends twenty put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children you're going to have twenty hands you know up there oh you're kidding oh no nobody has nobody has a non gifted child and i keep thinking you know uh gifted is is Einstein or you know uh musical prodigies it's it's not a kid who's you know precocious yeah you know what has you know has has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who's above average is now gifted hum that's interesting i don't know mine didn't did not fall into the gifted category i don't know oh don't say that nope and i would never have said so either uh but uh they managed to get through although not always with flying colors uh in fact one of the incidents i was thinking of that my son had um he was struggling with senior English and i had a meeting with the uh vice principal and the English instructor and uh she showed me a paper that he had just handed in and she told me what she had requested and i read it and while it had you know a few little grammatical problems it wasn't very long and so forth i thought it had some nice well thought out uh parts to it she gave him an F on that paper and i thought well now here you have a student who is trying to pass who is struggling with your subject and you give them an F um-hum on something that doesn't seem that bad to me what are you telling that student um-hum you're telling them that well hey you might as well forget it you know well you see i think that that just harks right back to the elementary and junior high years because i have a stepson now who's twenty five and uh i was just absolutely shocked uh the first time that i saw his schoolwork uh i remember being you know taught and i think you know it you have to teach how to write an answer and you know how to construct a thought process um-hum and you know they can get a they they can grasp the points can they convey the data verbally or in writing and that's what's you know really scary to me um i would really you know there's such a a push push among among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate i would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought and at an early age and if they can't i mean if they have missed that training then somebody you know before you're you you start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they're thinking teach them these basic skills yeah uh it's pretty sad to think uh about those who even even even today are graduating from school and they are telling tha t they don't know how to read you know well my stepson you know i he went into the Navy or Air Force i just really get my military i married into a military family and i don't know i really address them all as generals so i don't offend anybody but uh you know fortunately for him he wasn't dumb but boy he sure had trouble you know putting things on on paper yeah and one of the things that that they did for him they tested him and they said that he's you know great in electronics but he yo u know he's really does need the basic skills and they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training and at that point he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors oh this is the kid who who really you you know barely made it through high school yeah and i keep thinking you know it's not it's really not too late at any point to do you know some that's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it you would have expected them to be the last ones to yes but yes and i kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations but i think that for this kid it's going to be you know his lifesaver otherwise he might have been driving trucks or framing houses you know from here to eternity yeah so i don't know you know it does make me nervous well i can see why if you've got little ones just coming along there's a a whole lot of stuff going on out there there is a whole lot of stuff going on out there and and part of me says i just would like to you know shut my eyes and pretend it doesn't you know go on or send them to private schools and then the you know the old social conscience says you know i'm not working i don't need to work maybe i should volunteer to you know teach what i know yeah maybe adult literacy maybe you know composition writing maybe you know uh volunteering you know on a tutor line or though the even through the elementary schools for help with homework or the other part of me says is God i've had enough kids do i really  do you have pets yeah i've got uh three cats uh yeah me and my roommate have a little business on the side and we we breed uh cats yeah it's it's three cats i see oh really that's interesting what breed do you do you deal in well well just about anything we get our hands on right now we've got a uh a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian i see oh my and uh yeah they're a lot of fun and we're not in it as a business we just we like cats and we decided well if we're going to have them we might as well get some purebreds and maybe make a little money on the side um-hum yeah um-hum sure yeah yeah i've never never done pets you know as a for breeding purposes i've just you know usually always had a pet of some kind around we're at currently we have two cats i've got a big old seventeen pound black male alley cat and i've got a little seven pound tabby cat that we got from the Humane Society she's the cutest little thing then i have a twelve year old Dachshund that's gosh she's one of the family absolutely yeah yeah a friend of mine had a Dachshund and it's same way i mean yeah yeah she's twelve years old she pretty well you know sets the ground rules for the household yeah and the cats listen right yeah loves that's right loves the little dog loves to travel of course she's dead asleep before we get to the end of the block and she never you know she sleeps the whole time but she loves to travel cats of course don't care too much to travel uh one of mine does the Himalayan Persian the little himmy um-hum if i take her to the vet i used to put her in her in a cage and take her down but now i just carry her out to the car and she crawls up in my uh up on my shoulder um-hum right um-hum um-hum um-hum and just watches everything yeah she she enjoys the car that's amazing yeah we've never had a cat of course like i said i guess the only time i've ever had a cat in the car has been in a carrier maybe maybe if we didn't put them in carriers maybe they would enjoy it more i don't know probably i think it's the carrier that scares them now on the other hand the Bombay hates the car she'll uh she probably so probably so um-hum uh when i bring that cage out she knows what's going to happen it's probably i don't know maybe it's the maybe it's the thought about the vet that worries her um-hum um-hum could be yeah could be yeah that our little tabby cat is the only cat that i've ever seen or had that she absolutely hates to be picked up she would rather just do anything than be picked up more normally you you know you can pick up a cat occasionally anyway she just absolutely hates it i don't know if it's um-hum will will she crawl up in your lap yeah some of them some of them are like that they uh they yeah they they don't want to be held but but whenever they want to sit in your lap they want you to be uh open to that yeah yes she does that but she yeah um-hum when she wants to of course um-hum um-hum um-hum that's right yeah she does that that's true that's true yeah yeah the little Turkish Vans like that pick her up and boy those claws come out and sticks her arms straight out with the claws extended yeah yeah silly silly cat um-hum yes um-hum just tense yeah absolutely yeah we've had our our two cats uh declawed because we keep them in the house all the time yeah well actually the little gray tabby wanders out in the back yard occasionally i have an eight foot uh security type fence out in the backyard she just kind of goes out and rolls around on the patio and comes back in um-hum yeah but our black cat has never never once been outside and has no interest in going outside you can actually leave the door open he'll come to the door and sit down but he never goes outside yeah most mine generally stay in the windows they're they're um-hum they love to watch the birds um yeah along the side one side of our house there's nothing but trees and bushes and we've got lots of squirrels and birds and all that around here and they just they'll sit there in that window for hours watching all this um-hum um-hum um-hum oh yeah they enjoy that um-hum that's right just hypnotized yeah yeah and they'll go to the doors and stand up on the screen door looking out but uh they're not too interested in going outside i yeah yeah yeah our little cat just wants wants out maybe once a day that's about all yeah the Bombay uh actually went through one of the screens last week trying to get out uh so i had to go round her up hum hum um-hum but uh yeah they're they're fun yeah my wife's a cat person until we married i'd never really oh we'd had a cat occasionally you know and left it outside most of the time we lived in kind of a rural area my wife's a real cat person one time not when we were together but at one time she had a total of like seventeen cats um-hum um sounds like my next door neighbor yeah boy i try to keep her away from the Humane Society she always want to bring something home you know yeah oh that's my problem i'll go down to the uh SPCA or the Humane shelter and i i feel so sorry for them and i just want to i want to bring them all home um-hum yeah that's what she does yeah that's right it's so pathetic to see them down there yes it really is i'm just uh it irritates me the way people mistreat animals and and they don't do it intentionally they just they're just doing it they go out and they think oh wouldn't it be cute to get a kitty um-hum um-hum get a kitten yeah um-hum and they go out and they don't have it fixed or anything and it has kittens and they can't support it and they take them down there and they end up getting that's right um-hum that's right or move off and leave them or move off and leave them and they they end i don't know where this one the my next door neighbor had a had a dead cat next to his front porch yeah i'd seen the cat around here before i thought it belonged to somebody but i have no idea what killed it um-hum oh gosh um-hum yeah good grief may have been poisoned or something it might have been might have gotten hold of something bad or it we had a cold snap here not too long ago it may have frozen out there i i sort of doubt it cats know how to take care of themselves yeah um-hum could be could be um-hum no not if they've never been out in any weather i wouldn't think so especially yeah well this this one was definitely outdoor cat because i saw him all the time and i suspect somebody had just had him and moved off um-hum yeah co uld be yeah that that's too bad it really is it is it's it's sad i mean and they do it to dogs absolutely yeah um-hum the last dog i got i think was that way because he was uh he was in fairly good shape but apparently just didn't have a home or couldn't find his way home and i don't believe it because he was one smart dog strange mixture he was uh um-hum um-hum right um-hum um-hum the best i can figure he was part Lab because he had a Lab head um-hum uh and definitely part Grayhound uh bloodhound because he had these head big old jowls had the bloodhound mouth but he had the soft bite of a Lab bloodhound yeah um-hum um-hum and he was the smartest dog i've ever seen he just i could talk to him and he knew what i was saying yeah um-hum yeah they they are smart they really are right next door or my neighbor across the street has a couple of Labs they're really nice dogs they really are um-hum well my my brother raises my brother raises Labs and he gave one to uh he gave one to me several years ago i see um-hum and she was she was just the sweetest little thing but they love to chew and so after she had chewed up my my redwood furniture um-hum um-hum yeah yes i've seen that uh she chewed the corners off the picnic table and chewed cross members off chairs yes i've had a German Shepherd that did that one time yeah oh i ended up getting her a six foot two by four and let and she had the best time with it um-hum i bet she did she'd grab that thing in the middle and it was just about as heavy as she was and she'd drag that thing around the yard she was a sight to behold um-hum um-hum that was cheap entertainment wasn't it yeah it was it's so easy to entertain them it really is our kids are all grown and gone and away from home so our our new family is the you know our two cats and our dog we never really well we had we did have some time to devote to them you know but not nearly as much time as we have now so they've really become children they're they're real characters they really well all of them are yeah yeah well they're enjoyable to to have around i i uh i run a little business out of the house here and uh i'm usually alone oh yeah they are um-hum um-hum um-hum and got all these cats around so they they keep me occupied well they um-hum they keep you entertained they sure do we have a uh my wife's uh mother is uh oh about seventy seven i guess she really gets a thrill when we go over to see her and bring the dog i think she's more happy to see the dog than she is us i can't get it can't get her convinced that she really shouldn't try to feed my dog chocolate though she always wants to do a little Hershey Kisses you know you really shouldn't feed chocolate to a dog especially a small dog no no they they get get her a get her a box of doggy biscuits to to to let her feed him so i kind of have to watch her when she's around the dog yeah i guess so yeah some for some reason she just really thinks that little dog needs some chocolate of course the dog thinks so too well of course Dachshunds and Dachshunds like chocolate i i remember i remember that other one too he was always after somebody's chocolate bar they do as a matter of fact they do um-hum um-hum yeah they love it they really do my my cats don't think much of chocolate course they're so they're so damn finicky anyway no oh yeah absolutely it's i think they can read the price tag on the cans of food yeah well they do well it it we found out that didn't work because we even even bought the expensive stuff and they looked at it like you've got to be kidding like you know what are you a fool paying that much money for this um-hum yeah now i think i've experienced my first cat here that will not eat tuna we have a cat that will not eat tuna um-hum i've got i've i've got one that won't doesn't even like anything with fish in it yeah that's strange um-hum yeah actually actually you know fish is not their natural food that's that's the yeah i thought yeah that's true people i don't know why i guess the cartoons and everything people grow up believing cats like fish the only reason they go after fish in a fishbowl is because it's moving it's something something to play with um-hum yeah that's right that's right yeah i believe this is the first cat that i've ever had that would not even consider eating tuna i bet it likes chicken though oh yeah absolutely and even beef as a matter of fact in small quantities yeah every one of mine yeah yeah even mine love chicken when i get in when i yeah when i get in there to fry chicken or something they're all standing around waiting because they know they're going to get a piece um-hum oh yeah they love love chicken um-hum um-hum that's right well Jeff it's been good talking to you i just i usually yeah okay well it's been fun you have a good day yeah yeah take care of those cats all right bye-bye yeah thanks a lot bye-bye  all right well credit cards i have some do you well yeah i i i've used them a bit too much sometimes yes me too yeah uh do you have uh like the Visa and MasterCard and and those that are those the ones that you use the the most or well i have uh we've got an American Express which we got that on purpose so we could pay that off every month that way we we know our limit uh-huh right yeah but then i also have department stores and um yeah you know we keep a couple hundred dollars um if that much charged on those which isn't too bad it's just your normal yeah yeah just a pretty pretty pretty much uh what you can pay monthly anyway you know getting clothes and stuff every once in awhile exactly yeah well we have uh have department store cards for nearly all the department stores i guess uh uh-huh uh but but we don't you know don't use them a lot uh right but we do have uh Visa cards uh yeah my wife has uh has an American Express through her through the company right and uh i don't even have an American Express to use for business so or i use a Visa all the time just your Visa yeah right and uh i i find that they you know they work all right i haven't found anybody that will will turn one down yeah i you know uh people always complain about American Express saying not enough people take it but i've i've rarely found a place that wouldn't that wouldn't take it so that doesn't bother me luckily uh-huh yeah the uh yeah it's it's uh it is convenient to have that you know and it and if you can do a the a lot more with the American Express when we do when we go traveling uh-huh uh the American Express works a lot better for some things because you can charge you know airline tickets oh does it sure and and get some benefits from that i think too that's true that's true that's that's real nice to you know but it's i tell you it's it's really uh it's tough to uh to deal with when you let your your balances build up you know so that it it's that's true you've we did it uh intentionally i did it intentionally i was running some business expenses uh-huh through the Visa card so i knew that i was running a balance up but it sure is hard to get it paid back i know paid back down it uh when we first got married we you know went and got all the credit cards and uh-huh of course charged those puppies up and it's oh boy when those bills start coming in they want a lot of money when you start getting them up there yeah but uh you know you find it's uh that the uh the interest rates vary so much on those that uh uh-huh uh-huh that we've been paying real close attention to that so we're using the ones that uh have the lower rate as a matter of fact the uh the uh credit union that's good uh-huh credit card i think has the lowest about the lowest interest rate of any of the ones that we use that's good i've noticed on the like the department stores they sure do hate it when you pay double payments uh-huh yeah you know it's like whoa yeah wait a minute don't pay us too much you know and they drop it your balance uh they drop your monthly payment down low because they want that interest to build up uh-huh right so that's what i normally try to do if it's pretty low i try to make a couple payments at a time and get it down quicker yeah but they're easy to use so you haven't been tempted uh to to call any of these nine hundred numbers trying to get a credit card then no have you i have been tempted i just i saw one of those ads on TV last night that you know somebody call in right now you know and you can get your gold Visa card or gold MasterCard but uh uh-huh i don't understand how they do that and uh of course it's a nine hundred number which that means they're going to charge you you know fifteen or twenty dollars just to make the phone call right but they say you can't be turned down and i don't understand how they can well the thing is the that a lot of those are like they're set up through a bank or a savings and loan type thing uh-huh and you have to have a deposit in that you know that deal of you know if you want a five hundred dollar credit line then you have to keep a five hundred dollar balance in there oh i see well then they sure they won't turn you down because they've got your money sure they've got your money already well gosh yeah yeah but that's yeah i know that's the way some of them work anyway well that's darn easy then yeah i wouldn't turn you down either i'll give you one right yeah huh no i haven't attempted that i'm satisfied with what we have right now and we do have a gas credit card and we use that yes uh yeah that's one that we don't use uh i've had uh you know had different companies or you know gas company cards before uh-huh but i didn't use them we we usually spend cash you know pay cash for gas and then uh most of the places will take uh the Visa card anyway so right right that's true that's true so i i can use that and uh well we uh my husband always usually always pays with cash but i never seem to have cash or at least not enough you know to fill a tank up so i always almost always use my credit card on that on that and then it's nice you do tend to pay more for gas but other than that it's it's a good deal i think yeah uh-huh yeah but they're of course now they're beginning to to get the picture i think uh like Chevron has just recently dropped theirs back yeah i saw that so they quit charging the extra i don't whether they they drop the ir price back to the cash price or raised all their prices up to the charge price yeah exactly but they won't they won't charge i saw that advertised too that's a good deal but it's real convenient it's real convenient for me i really i just like being able to go in and do that but uh yeah and and it's like American Express you have to pay it off at the end of the month so huh yeah it's not going to go up too high yeah so it's good for emergencies right yeah that's it's always handy to have that that credit card for whatever it is that you might need it for that's what we do on that's true we always use especially on trips you know we just charge all our gas that saves us spending it or shelling out the cash right then yeah that's it when when we travel it's we used to use our the gas card just for that you know uh-huh right and now we don't have of course we don't drive on our trips very much anymore either we used to drive like we'd drive to New Orleans twice a year yeah oh yeah and uh we don't go we don't we don't drive anymore when we go down there we usually fly so yeah you know you can fly just about as cheap as you can drive so i know and isn't that terrible yeah so and save all that money yeah so anyway hum well do you think we've well i think they've got enough uh enough information from us anyway okay well thanks for talking okay it's nice talking to you okay bye-bye you too bye-bye  okay my views it asked for my views so my views on that are yes i do still consider them a threat uh-huh really and yes i do and the reason i do is because um i've with uh Gorbachev was raised and his mentor was i because it was Nikita Khrushchev i believe i know it was one of the old old school Russian and uh he he is a definite he is a Marxist Leninist communist through and through uh-huh uh-huh and Marxist Leninist communism is a threat to the United States because um the whole nature of it is to control the world the the whole goal of the Marxist Leninist theology is world domination uh-huh and i do not believe that it has not they've never stated that their goal is not to you know take over the world and they've never repented of all the massacres all the just the you know the hundreds of thousands of uh massacres they've killed more Jews oh yeah and all this and so no i don't trust them a bit i think it's a big scam think so yes i do i yes i would all but say i know it's a scam you can't trust him he was the head of the KGB for years was he yes he was for many many years he was trained in the old school of Lenin theology and he he's never changed any of his any of the he he deals in that kind of theology he's you know he might say one thing but what he does is Marxist and Leninist in nature and so uh-huh and so that's why the Russians are so angry with him right now is because they've they know it's a scam and so you know i that's what i feel i don't know what do you feel do you agree with me or disagree uh-huh yeah um you know it's it's hard to say uh if if things change uh change there so rapidly but uh Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev is i don't know i think i think you you're right he's a chameleon he's just a he's he he's just he seems to have flip flopped on you know uh uh you know when they first came into power when uh President Reagan was in he was this real nice guy and he was uh-huh trying to uh win everybody in the West over about what oh what a great reformer he was and all this other stuff but then you know now he's uh know now he's uh you know crushing the uh demonstrations and and and trying to close close it off again so i i i can't figure i can't figure him out i don't know if he's being pressured from right uh above or around or uh from other places in in well if he got out of line too much from the old school they'd just knock him off i mean they're not going they're not going to permit anyone in that Russian Parliament to get in power that's going to change anything too much so yeah that their people are starving i mean they cannot right they've got to know that something's got to give because they're in their society you're not at you know it's supposed to be all for one and one for all but that ain't how it works baby i mean that's you know they're not going to do something unless they've got incentives and they don't have any incentives to work uh-huh no because they've taken them from the people because the Marxist Leninist theology is to i mean it really is its own religion it it could be classified in theological terms as a religion because it is uh-huh but they deny God self is everything self you know everything is um for me for me for me and therefore or for the for the people for the people which means everybody else except you right but that's not what they really do they say that but that's not the reality of it even the Bolshevik revolution the whole thing was uh yeah an attempt to uh gain authority without you know having to be risen up in authority the best way to get Godly authority is to you know work and and work your way to the you know work your way up not being promoted by man because promotion comes from God uh-huh yeah but when you anytime you see a nation go in and just overtake it and it's take it take authority take control it's a i believe it's a spiritual yeah thing that happens and it's like a spirit of witchcraft it's like a a bad spirit goes over that nation because you have these people that want they're power hungry uh-huh and they want all this power and they want to control all these people and it's not for the people it's for themselves and the way you know that is because they didn't work their way up from the bottom up they went in and they took power and they took authority and they uh-huh took authority and they cut and they stab and and our nation does that a lot too i know it's not necessarily i don't think this is the greatest system either but i just feel like there's just a lot of oppression over the Soviet Union because of that the authority is there to exalt self that's the whole Leninist theology they deny God they deny any creator they've yeah forbade religion for years and years and God's the one that opened the doors for their religion for for Christianity to go in Russia it's not it's not Gorbachev he will not receive the credit for that because one man uh-huh saying that could not have done anything God had to open those doors and i believe that the the pressure just got so great from the people yeah uh-huh because that they you know they God just honored their prayers and did a miracle because i don't know we our pastor went to Russia and we work with a lot of churches in Minsk and in Belev Russia and some other places and so i don't know i have a real heart for Russia that's why i think it's funny we got this call because i have a good friend my one of my best friends is going into into the underground church cause it uh-huh basically it's still underground it oh yeah and so they're going in a mission trip into Latvia in about six months and so they're preparing for the trip you know and and it was i sat behind her Sunday and they had their Russia team folder so i thought oh that's cool so anyway so this is kind of one of my little pet babies but anyway i don't know i just yeah i think they want a one world order that's what i think i think Gorbachev would like to see a one world order a one world economic community and a one world government with him in charge of it and Bush is going around talking about it too yeah and it's like all these pawns on this chess big all these players on this big chess game you know and it's a world championship and who is ultimately going to get the power who's going to get put in checkmate and who's going to be ruled out of the game yeah and who's going to have the power over what they want to establish in this one world you know community they're always talking about it all the time oh yeah you hear a lot about it yeah but it it's all that it's it's all that uh the new age philosophy and um uh-huh are you a Christian you must be to know new age yes oh yes oh yes i know all about the new age philosophy yeah and uh it's yeah right but they are in such disarray over there they're not in any position to exalt exert themselves over anybody right now like they were uh-huh uh-huh i mean with Eastern Europe falling apart and their whole economic system falling apart they can that that we need to take real advantage of that uh-huh uh-huh yeah to to pull their satellites away from them but yeah i think that they still are a threat but yet maybe a different ki nd of a threat than a military threat but i do believe that they're a military threat i think yeah just look what we did to Iraq well it was with Russian were they fought us with Russian weapons and they've they found out the hard way how bad badly put together the Russian weapons are right uh-huh that's true yeah that's true they did didn't they i know it's it's interesting i still wouldn't want to take them on though i still wouldn't want to take them i still think we need to be very careful but i believe that their economic or an economic threat more than anything at this point because they want control over the i know they want control over the European economic community and that you know that's why i see them diversifying their their power and their control that they have oh yeah oh yeah uh-huh and like for you know instead of just being oh big tough Russia but i still believe they've uh they've probably got weapons we can i mean they they never would sell to anybody else yeah oh of course you know so i guess i feel like yeah they probably i wouldn't want to mess with them but i don't trust them i'm not all like oh yeah they're just like us i i have a heart for the people of Russia no no no no not not not for the leaders definitely not for the leaders no i wouldn't be surprised if Gorbachev wasn't a satanist wasn't a satanist i'm not kidding well they're they're they're a secret they're a secret society they're a secretive society right even yeah you know and they're not going to let you see what they don't want you to see exactly even you know in our own country i mean Bush was in the scull and bones the Trilateral Commission and all these groups with ulterior motives and so it's like what on earth is you know are these people ever here and involved in um in the high ranking things i mean when you look at their history and what they've done to their own people what they've done it's like yeah yeah man can we trust them have they repented for what they did have they made a world apology no they haven't we we repented this was wrong we're going to start seeking God and we're going to start seeing God to do for our nation what needs to be done and even Bush will call a national day of prayer is Bush saved i don't know God knows he says he is and i'm going to trust that with him but i mean it's just no i don't trust them yeah no you'd be crazy if you trust them but anyway call it what is it McCarthyism no i'm not like that i just got enough common sense that nope to you come repent make a world apology for all the wrongs that you've done and yeah we've done wrongs but we've not done near the atrocities they've done and we need to maybe do that also you know uh-huh you know i'm saying i'm not saying like oh America we're so we're perfect over here i'm not saying that either but that's not what the question asked so boy i could preach uh-huh  all right um so let me guess it's the Dallas Cowboys no no no not originally from Texas oh okay uh either San Francisco or Miami okay now San Francisco i think's almost everybody's favorite and uh uh i don't know not many people know about Miami i used to be a big Miami fan when they back in the seventies when they were real good Larry Csonka and all them yeah yeah they were my favorite team for a while well i didn't get uh into football until about Danny Dan Marino's first year okay are you you used to live in Miami no oh originally from Louisville Kentucky okay no just uh i liked them yeah my biggest team ever my favorite was uh the Los Angeles Rams they're pretty good i like their yeah i never lived anywhere near Los Angeles um i liked Eric Dickerson Dickerson yeah uh yeah i don't know but i think they're on the down slide i don't know i think the team coming up is the Raiders the Raiders huh um yeah he's getting some teams together some people together there yeah i think the the team i like rooting for the best which i don't i don't know if they really are the a good team but they're an underdog that's why i like them is the Philadelphia Eagles sometimes i don't like Randall Cunningham you don't like him no i like him uh i like him because he's reckless i think that's why i don't like him okay now my underdog team is the Broncos the Broncos oh yuck i hate them yeah well people put me in labor back when they was in the Super Bowl yeah i used to live in Colorado and i i kind of rooted against them and everyone else couldn't understand why because the people out there are really serious about them oh yeah i know my sister lived in Colorado for a little while and uh so i i don't know she said they go crazy yeah i had fun rooting against them it was yeah you'd have the whole town on you didn't you i know it was kind of funny because i wasn't from Colorado yeah well i i don't know but um i've never been to any a game or anything like that uh-huh i just uh i've gone to a few games i not in a while went to uh actually went to a play off game once that would've been great when we lived i lived in Maryland and we saw the Raiders play the Colts in the play off when was this it was like uh at least ten years ago okay it went into double overtime i bet that was a good one yeah it was a great game i like those close games so who do you think's going to win this year right down this year that's a toss up between uh the Giants with them trying to repeat um-hum and oh i hate to hazard a guess uh i'm trying to go through and see who's got who uh i'd say the Raiders but i doubt it i think they're going to be next year hum uh San Francisco might try to make a run back but i doubt it yeah they've lost too many people yeah i think Buffalo's got a pretty good shot yeah yeah i uh if they hold together forget who their quarterback is i can see his face yeah i can't remember his name either what is his uh let's see they have the defense to do it yeah well uh if i could think of some of their names i Bruce Smith Bruce Smith uh he's a guard isn't he no he's a defensive end yeah he's a big mean guy i shoot i can't even think who's quarterback uh the uh darn uh coach name for the Bills um isn't it Marv Levy yeah i think so yeah that's it i had fun watching the Super Bowl last year because the the Giants' coach looks like my sister's boyfriend Jim i'm like what is he doing what's Matt doing out there called her up and said hey what's your boyfriend doing out in TV the what now who who was this uh the the Giants' coach um what's his name i can't think of his name oh Bill Parcells Bill Parcells yeah my sister's boyfriend looks like him oh okay so i had fun laughing at it all right i i didn't catch that for a minute yeah looks like him a lot younger but oh there's one team that i out and out hate and that's the Bears you hate the Bears i don't really like the Bears either uh Mike Ditka i don't like the way he treats people um i didn't like him from uh oh one year when uh McMahon was real big f or the Bears yeah and uh he had put Doug Flutie in uh-huh and Doug Flutie had called a time out huh you know he was in trouble the time was running out on the clock and he goes walking up to Mike Ditka to talk to him and Mike Ditka just turns his back on him and walks away huh and i didn't think that's you don't do that no i mean that's not what a team's about uh but he you know i mean if a guy screws up you got to say okay you screwed up what do we do now and move on it's you know i played softball and i screwed up coming around third base one time and the uh yeah the coach actually called time out and came and tapped my tail with her foot and said you know pointed that finger and went ah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know and i thought okay so that's better than ignoring you i think you know yeah well it didn't hurt and she was more you know we was in a uh it was a play off of a sort i guess yeah we was down in there in North Carolina huh huh uh for the uh nationals wow i'm trying to think where we were i don't remember where we were huh well Raleigh just got a uh one of the new football teams the new World whatever it is World Football League or World League yeah yeah but Raleigh Sky Raleigh Durham Skyhawks have you watched any of those games i watched a little bit this weekend a few minutes of the one game oh i've watched the New Jersey and New York teams you know i they're combined yeah that's that's who was playing i've watched them twice and they look like bumbling idiots out there at times uh they don't look like they know what they're doing huh and i know they do they've got to know yeah but i watched them when they was playing that team over there in New England i think is where it was and uh last week i watched them play huh and they just they looked terrible but they got the the NFL backing them so they might make it huh yeah that would be interesting to see i'm uh every attempt so far i think has failed at a second football league uh yeah well well uh that's how i got to liking Doug Flutie he was playing for the Generals yeah on uh the uh USFL uh-huh and down in Memphis they had a uh team called the Showboats yeah i remember that and uh you know i didn't care for the Showboats much but i did like a couple of their players huh uh and a couple of them even went to the uh NFL i just don't remember their names huh uh Doug Flutie's the only one that sticks out in my head for some reason huh uh i think that's because of what Ditka done to him that just put it in my head and kept it there but uh i don't know yeah but uh i don't know well it will be interesting seeing these games across the you know from London or wherever yeah well i that the London Knights i think is who it is Spain uh-huh uh they were a fairly decent looking team huh they take the football serious yeah uh shoot i don't remember remember what the score well they have a whole nation behind them you got to remember that instead of just you know one section of the country like we have yeah that's true i never thought of it like that they don't they don't have another football team to root for no competition yeah so no competition they're going to have a lot more support over there yeah i know they take their softball serious or their soccer serious i mean yeah definitely and so i guess they would take it serious i i never thought of it like that i guess the next time somebody starts harping down i'll just bring that up yeah that's a good come back thank you all right all right sounds good what about your kickers huh kickers on softball football teams kickers huh i don't know i hadn't thought too much about that i always liked Matt Bahr because he went to Penn State oh i like Penn State my dad both my mom and dad went to Penn State so i i've i've barely made it out of high school uh-huh uh but i like uh Reggie Roby Reggie Roby who does he play for he Miami okay uh uh at times i like Kevin Butler on the Bears you know there are some teams uh some guys i like on the Bears huh uh-huh he's he's all right but they got uh uh what's his name i was going to mention Majkowski but he's a quarterback oh well i can't think of his name huh can't even think of what team he plays for either huh that's real bright huh all right well listen i've got to go yeah well it was good talking to you all right bye-bye all right bye-bye  okay do you have you noticed any new um trends in politics well the one i think is interesting is the California Los Angeles police chief who says he wants to resign and did you hear yesterday that Mayor Bradley said that uh he should oh really no i didn't hear that think it i think what's interesting is that uh uh the political activists Jesse Jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating i find it interesting that uh outsiders would bother to go in how do how do you feel about people like Jesse Jackson getting involved um i think sometimes it's good for people outside they get a different perspective uh perspective on an issue and stuff so yeah i don't see any problem with outsiders going in and getting a little bit involved i think though that it should still be uh sort of up to the majority in the area i don't know on something like that they wouldn't really vote on it or anything though what do you think Gates should resign probably so just because they were under his authority and he obviously failed somewhere along the line well well speaking of that kind of issue have you kept up with John Wiley Price yeah what do you think of him oh um i think he's got good intentions but i'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right he's an interesting person i was talking to someone who said that uh for all his obvious uh attention to efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the uh i guess he's on the County uh oh Board of Supervisors or i think and that that that uh at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker right uh-huh and is really quite agreeable uh uh and that the stuff we see in the you know in the media is uh well he's really just trying to make a political statement i i find that an interesting element of politics that we don't that that most people would not know that John Wiley Price apparently is a is a you know course he's got in this this deal over racism and uh you know name calling and all this but apparently he's a a worker uh you may disagree with him but i i i find this whole what do you think of this uh fourteen one and ten four one in Dallas oh i think that they should go ahead and go to the uh fourteen one i to me it's just fair you know and equal it seem like every area should have an equal voice i agree with you but did you see the map they drew up on uh on how they were gonna divide up the districts no it was it was the strangest i'm i'm not sure it was gerrymandered but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff i i i guess i'm a little cynical of the of the power base i i i and i don't quite understand why the power base uh doesn't uh why they don't go with fourteen one i you know i and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the the uh i think it's Hispanics don't vote because they don't think that they have any affect and it's i i guess i am disappointed with Dallas in that uh the fourteen one it yeah i don't know you can you can disagree with Al Lipscomb and uh what's what's the lady's name Diane Ragsdale yeah you can disagree with uh what they're doing and what they're saying but in reality i think they're they're trying to represent their constituents yeah and i think Dallas is doing itself a disservice i think they ought to get on with something important yeah they really make themselves look bad and i don't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one yeah and i but i think even i even those people are it's like Pauken and Box and these people i think it's i find it interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that the question is did we get anything good done it's like this whole school issue are are you involved in the schools at all public school no huh-uh this whole thing down there where they're they're trying to um uh you know devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools and and it all seems you know everybody's trying to one-upmanship on everybody else so yeah yeah it i i have got to run to a meeting it's good talking to you i don't think we've gone our our ten minutes but i think we've we've talked long enough so okay was okay good talking to you bye okay good night  uh yes i do believe that there is too much immigration now well yeah a well yeah living in Texas especially i see it and and did you well it's not just that are there enough jobs for people here now no no it's terrible and yet they're letting more people in daily yeah from everywhere too not just from Mexico you know just everywhere yeah yeah i wasn't talking about just Mexico i was talking about Europeans the Eastern Block uh it's terrible yeah yeah i there's and there's nothing we can do about it the government seems to do as they wish when they wish yeah they don't ask us do they no you know and it's really hard i think on the immigrants because they come over here all they you know thinking that they're going to have money and jobs and success and everything and then they then there is no jobs and they end up homeless and not knowing anybody and no money and it's terrible yes living under a bridge so to speak now it's true though that the bulk of of immigrants yes are successful really and true how how how how do you figure uh i saw it on the news uh i saw it on the news yes the bulk of immigrants legal immigrants to this country are successful you know they pay to end up as tax paying citizens did you really making uh above middle class income whatever that is in the the united states now probably more than what i'm making maybe i should become an immigrant and go somewhere else well yeah you work for TI uh they say that's due to their work ethic now i don't know if that's true or not it just might be a matter of luck well but then America always has been for the immigrant yeah well uh you know if it hadn't been for that i guess i wouldn't be here because my family came from France and uh one side and one side came from Germany so huh none of us would yeah there you know there's only a very few native Americans here and then they're treated rotten the actual Native Americans the Indians well they've got they they've got the worst deal around yes they are well most of them you're right but then i drive through Riodosa and i think well not all of them have it desperately bad i've never you know you've you've driven by you know the Mountain Gods outside of Riodosa haven't you i've never been been out there oh it's beautiful country up there in the mountains of New Mexico uh-huh oh just just gorgeous and that inn is huge and but now uh like i say that one tribe is the exception not the rule yeah you know most tribes were treated dreadfully yeah oh and still are and still are yes you know don't have good jobs and living on reservations alcoholics and oh it's terrible it makes me really ill but i've never even been to Colorado oh a native Texan no a native Californian but a twenty year Texan i've been here twenty years so oh well i'm i'm i'm a native born Texan but uh you know how it is yeah yeah we go where the work is that's true that's true well did you start with TI out here and then go to uh in Lubbock and oh okay and then went to Colorado yeah in seventy four so so yes i am i am a long time TIer so do you see a lot of uh well let's see what's in Colorado do you see a lot of immigrants of any kind like like we do here uh the ones we see are Americans by marriage a huge number here in Colorado Springs there's an Air Force base and an army base uh-huh so there's people that marry GIs Korean Americans German Americans uh a few Japanese oh okay yeah few Chinese you understand yeah yeah but then you know too on a it's uh of course what i think about when we talk about immigrants i know they're coming from everywhere but i think a lot about coming from Mexico because i guess i'm so close to that and if they close the well the borders are closed basically i mean they're but we get all these people that come in illegally and stay yeah well that's not really immigration well no that's true it's not but it is i mean they're coming i mean we've we've got yeah yeah you can't stop them and once they're here to some extent we support them they're supposed to have all these laws passed where people aren't supposed to hire illegal aliens and all this and whether that's working or not i don't know because i don't hear anymore about it i don't either but uh what i suspect is that illegals were hired for a hundred and fifty years of Texas history i don't think they can stop it by a federal edict i don't think the federal government can stop it by making by waving their magic wand and saying it will happen no more it's just too inbred in the culture you know yeah i grew up in Dumas and Lubbock and uh every roofing crew was illegal i know well all the restaurants here too at one time now it's see how i'm not in the restaurant business anymore so i really don't know but at one time the whole kitchen crew and the busboys and everything were all illegals in in most of the restaurants i worked in as a waitress you know it whether that came to a halt i don't know sure see uh still some migrant labor is legal you know in California i know it is it is in Texas too is it too in Texas also i i didn't know yes yeah during cotton harvest and whenever the the uh tomatoes and all are but see they'll come in and do work that other people won't do now i don't know about this day and time when there's so many people out of work i know if i was out of work i'd do anything to make money well because it's pretty scary when you own a home and you know well the truth of the matter is i don't know what your home payments are but you couldn't make a living on what they earn you could you could not you could not have you seen how those poor people live huh-uh migrant labor camps oh my God they live in cardboard boxes oh it's horrible isn't it and these fine Americans take care of them um-hum see and they put their children to work and everything don't they and i yes and i don't hold it against the people no they're hard workers trying to make it and no one and see Americans wouldn't do it wouldn't they wouldn't live like that no they wouldn't do it no they'll they'll ask for a handout first you couldn't get the street people i was just going to say you couldn't get these homeless people probably to do that i see them on corners with signs saying i'll work for a meal but i'll bet you if you stopped and you offered them a meal if they'd come and do your yard they'd get out of it some way they just really would no no what they're doing is they're asking for handouts that's right that's right because if you took them into your home to to work in your yard or whatever they'd know where your house is and how to break in then i know it or now that's not true of all of them there are but how do you know the good from the bad i i don't i don't know but i'm sure that times being as hard as they are and times are hard not everyone's that way you know good people are being put out of jobs now oh yes how well i know i was laid off last year but i was i was lucky because i was one of the first groups to go from TI well in in division one and i got uh went right to you know they have the job centers for us and everything and i just oh so you don't oh and you got transferred to a different right oh boy i worked hard through i went through the J O B's and found this and was versatile enough had a little bit of office experience and they hired me and i was just real thankful and now there's nothing for all the people who are getting laid off now there's just nothing yeah i've i've i've noticed you know i know Colorado Springs has been hit also uh rumors still persist i try not to believe them and listen to them but they still persist that the plant will close i don't know i haven't heard anything i don't hear much about Colorado Springs it's kind of like they're kind of trying to be invisible forget about us forget about us yeah so you're in division what now corporate corporate okay yeah that that must feel somewhat safer i'm in in i'm in payroll division nine yeah corporate payroll so it didn't for a while there were a lot of rumors flying and uh i still hold a red badge and it's still uh i'm still under five years so if they had a layoff in division nine bumping and  oh uh so what's what's your favorite exercise well my i guess uh sports uh i'm don't play as much sports as i used to because i'm i'm too old for it now but uh i still play golf i like to bowl although i hadn't bowled in quite a while but i guess my main exercise right now is probably golf oh that's pretty good exercise you do you drive a cart or do you carry your bag uh this last tournament i was in i walked nine holes and almost dropped so i shared a cart yeah it gets a long ways after a while yeah especially on a real hilly course yeah oh let's see i i play racquetball mostly yeah um i don't play very much anymore because i've fractured my right ankle twice oh and uh fractured it on both sides and so it's kind of weak i'm afraid to get out there and try it again um they have a real nice uh health club there at TI Lewisville racquetball courts and uh hand ball courts and it's a real nice facility i just haven't taken advantage of it yet though do do do they give the employees time off during the day to go no not really a lot of places do that now they'll they'll set aside you know like an hour a day that you can go exercise yeah yeah that's a pretty good idea because people who take advantage of it end up in better health and saves them on health care yeah yeah um yeah i like bowling too i haven't been for a while just don't have the time yeah but uh i guess bowling and racquetball's about it for me walking every once in a while but yeah not a great deal of that yeah i've i wish they'd split that bowling season up into uh three seasons um-hum right now they have a real short season and a real long season um-hum the summer league is just too long yeah well that's my uh i mean every time i've tried to go you know it's always there's there's always a league bowling yeah yeah and it it's just so you either have to wait or yeah you're next to to league bowlers and after a while it just gets to be a pain yeah yeah there's there's hardly no open alleys anymore it's all yeah yeah especially here in Raleigh we've got such little bitty bowling alleys all taken up yeah little bitty everything here but uh also TI has some good uh uh some good jogging tracks every once in a while while i'm sitting there eating lunch i'll look look out and see people jogging i guess on their lunch hour yeah um a friend of mine works at uh IBM in Charlotte yeah and they've got a real nice building down there on a great big piece of land and it's a huge plant i mean this thing's just enormous and that's what they do at lunch time they go out and run around the building yeah i'm not i was never into jogging i hated that when i was in high school playing football coach was always making us run yeah yeah i just sort of hated it from that point on well i i guess i would love to play basketball but but i don't i don't think i'd have the wind for that i guess of all the sports that probably gives you more exercise than any any sport there is yeah it's that's a tough one to play i i used to play it when i was younger but yeah took it out of me then and i'd hate to think what it would do to me now yeah but uh yeah i got to stick to more sedate sports yeah yeah i i as soon as i as soon as i can find me an ankle a good uh a good ankle brace i'm going to start playing some racquetball again but i'm not going out there with an unsupported ankle anymore yeah yeah i'm tired of running around on crutches for two months at a time and i'm not lucky enough to just go ahead and break it you know the things got to get fractured so that it never heals properly yeah yeah you might have to go to those old old old-timey high top tennis shoes that they used to wear well i've got a pair of those uh that's those are the ones that i wear when i go out there um yeah yeah trouble is i can't get them tight enough tight enough to really support your ankle to to really give me what i feel is support um so i'm i i i think probably just an ace bandage would work yeah yeah but i want to get one of those um padded ankle yeah what you call its only bad thing about an ace bandage if you wrap it tight enough so that really supports your ankle it's going to cut off the blood yeah it's going to cut off the circulation yeah yeah i i think i tried that one time a couple years ago and it did the same did that same thing yeah you end up loosening it up and then of course you don't have any yeah yeah i think i'll probably just have to go with one of those splint braces or something yeah but um well i guess that's about it for exercise that's about it as far as exercise us old guys just don't do it very much do we no unless unless you c all pushing yourself away from the table more exercise well that's that's good exercise and i don't do enough of that either i sat down to a double dose of spaghetti tonight i yeah well i was cooking me a grilled cheese um i like grilled cheese too yeah cheese is bad for you i know well you know i i i wonder though it's i think it really depends on the person yeah i was reading an article in the paper the other morning these doctors are baffled about this eighty seven year old man who eats thirty boiled eggs a day yeah did you see that yeah yeah i heard about it and they're wondering where does that cholesterol go yeah i think it it's all in the metabolism of of the it i think it is too And i and i think things like eggs and cheese anything like that i think it just depends on who you are yeah because uh i know people who eat tons of that kind of stuff and they're just as healthy as can be yeah i mean i'm i'm sort of strange in a way i'm i'm about twenty pounds overweight and i smoke but my blood pressure is about my last reading was just the other day it was one hundred two over seventy nine well that's that's the same with me i do both and my blood pressure is i think it was the last time i took it it was a hundred and hundred and ten over seventy or something like that yeah good and low yeah and uh i mean you'd think by looking at me my i'd have a bad heart and everything terrific heart great blood pressure yeah yeah jeez i'm not worried about it no if you didn't eat if you knocked off everything that they say is not good for you to eat uh you'd be just about down to bread and water yeah exactly and and and even then you've got to watch the bread and the water yeah it would have to be a diet bread yeah you never know what's in the water either well it's been nice talking with you well good talking to you you have yourself a good night okay you too talk thank you talk to you later bye-bye  well i don't know but uh i'm twenty two years old and i think it would be uh it's not a good choice to do that i mean you have uh everything here you know like uh the Army and everything else is all all voluntary and that's the way you're going to dedicate yourself right to to that you know to your job if it's voluntary i mean if you don't like it i mean if you're like in other places where they have a you know mandatory you know uh services yeah sort of like the draft do you know in the Army you're not going to uh uh be i i understand i understand what you're saying i'm i'm twenty four and uh you know i i don't think that i would be willing to to dedicate you know a year or two years of my life because i mean the thing is is that whenever you i mean you seen like for example you know like the war that just went on you saw you saw that to a right some people were not going you know people that that had all the benefits that were sitting around for years you know maybe three four years getting paid uh by the government or you know right exactly they just when the when the time came they said no way you know when they when that was their job they joined it because they wanted to or well you know some people didn't right didn't have the you know the money they said it's a good way of uh in coming in but those are public service i mean you i mean you would be getting paid very little you know or anything at all right and uh you would just hate it so much that whatever you had to do would be just you know it's like you know you just do the minimum yeah yeah i mean you wouldn't you wouldn't do it i mean the the the thing would be that it would throw you you know totally the wrong way you would be there because you had to be there right exactly but yet you would still respond to everything in a very you know negative way you know it's like do this why you know right right right i i have a i don't i don't have to do anything you know it's like what am i going to do if i sit here if i sit here for a whole year they'll let me go and then i can get back to my life exactly you know and i and i'm sure there is a problem about uh getting you know the volunteers to do that and maybe they could uh spend a little bit more money on promotion and and uh advertise it a little bit more yeah uh so that the public is a little more aware of it but uh i definitely agree with you i would hate to to see that become mandatory well there i don't think there's any way it can you know like they say this proposal would anywhere would get anywhere because of the i mean first of all i've never heard of it until this this phone call you know right and uh if it is actually proposed and taken you know to the government or something that would be political suicide for anybody to i would think yeah to to actually support it you know it would be just like saying that you know what are what are you crazy i mean there right right i mean you i mean you know we had enough with the abortion issue that's still going around that you guys want to bring you know the next you know exactly next big issue up yeah yeah because i think uh young and old alike uh would would more or less agree on this issue yeah uh maybe certain religions uh you know i think it's is it the Mormons or somebody i know at Brigham Young University they have to do like a mandatory uh year or two years worth of sort of service but uh whatever that religion is but see but you're going there and you know what you're getting into that's right and that is a that is a definite choice uh yeah and and i i believe it's just that religion that's not a you know a prominent uh predominant religion uh religion so i don't i don't think that that uh issue would hold much water yeah but it's it's not like saying like i'm born and then when i reached a certain age i'm going to have to do something you know in a political right it's uh it's not by choice it's like everything everything else you know it's like if i want to do it i'll do it but you know it's like you know and uh you know i have a background i'm from Argentina right and uh everybody everybody that is unlucky enough has to do the military service i see and but you go into this whole big lottery every year and you know each uh your last three digits of your document you know like your social security number you're matched up with other numbers right oh i see from uh from uh one to a thousand right and so if your number is below four hundred you're not going to have to do it i see say it's between four hundred and six hundred you might have to do it depending how many people are in your class and you know like you the they right your age group or whatever yeah and if it's above six hundred you're going to have to do it and i got one thirty one oh Lord oh okay so you felt pretty good then huh and so yeah i i didn't have to do it but the thing was that you have you know the whole the whole nation's watching you know like if if it's your class everybody that's your same age is listening listening to the radio right waiting for them to announce the number you know golly and it's like and then you know you have people you know going you know it's like everywhere you know you have some people that are glad some people that are saying shit and the other people that are going oh my God i'm somewhere in the middle you know it's like wow am i going to have to do it right yeah right there on the borderline huh yeah and you know but it's my brother goes everybody in my family had to do it and they go you know it's just a year and a half of your life that's that's totally wasted you don't do anything else there's no time and you don't do anything jeez you know you go there you train you get treated like shit and then you you i mean then you get out so it's it's no is it not educational training it's strictly it's strictly uh military i see right and so i mean but you know it's like the thing is is that you know you just get treated i mean one one of the guys that was doing it was uh like uh a waiter at one of the restaurants that know you know like the military had right and that was his job you know he got he got you know like three months of uh you know physical training God and then he got to serve all these people you know but that's what they do i mean that's a year and a half of your life that's that you don't do anything that you have to be there you know maybe five times you know five times a week and that you know that you have a i guess a round robin schedule or something right jeez and i guess a minimal pay or and uh no oh there i don't i don't think i don't think there is any pay wait i'm not sure because what happens is you get to like to ride buses for free do you they get paid very well oh well you do i guess you do get paid but the thing is is that you know people are what if they see you in the uniform oh you get a little benefits oh they know right like for example you you know like when they go around the train asking for tickets like short distant trains they won't ask you if you if you're wearing your military uniform for a ticket they'll just skip you right i see i see and uh you know it's like they they consider that but it would be the same way here you know it's like if if you had to do it you know you have a big sign i'm sorry i don't get paid you know right right it's like please let me ride for free you know it's like i'm i'm living off dad for these wonderful two years which i have to do you know it's like right and then the other thing is when i get out of college at twenty eight with my BS you know it's like by the time well yeah yeah you're thirty years old and trying to get your first job yeah yeah and so that would be that would be see there're too many things that go against it that would be ridiculous right right so oh well it's been seven minutes well that sounds good i don't i don't well i don't i don't think they'll ever pass this i i i'm just going to laugh if i ever see it in the newspapers i i mean i don't read the newspaper that much but i never heard anything about it so well i'm i haven't either and so uh yeah i don't i don't think much will come up of it so and but then you won't have to do it just imagine sometimes your kids you'll be saying well it's your job go do it you know but it that's right that's right it's easier after you're you don't have to worry about it yeah really then you'll have to say see in my age i didn't have to do it oh really dad yeah oh well okay that's right that's right well hey i appreciate the call talk to you later bye-bye yeah bye-bye  get us going okay are are you at TI Austin or well i left TI in January but i signed up for this before i did oh that's great no uh uh my daughter has talked to my daughter up here with us i have another one and she's talked to students uh so i guess they have uh sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things so they're if you're a computer user so my daughter has talked to two students uh that were non TIers so i guess oh yeah oh i think that's a that's a good idea all right we're we're on finances have you have you retired or uh oh no no no no actually i left TI um i had basically set my sights to leave TI when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninety one oh because i i definitely definitely need to make a little more money and uh i haven't really accomplished that yet but i'm trying oh yeah oh yeah it's uh that's the finances i guess we're on the subject of finances it is tough uh i've been with TI i'm just going to be fifteen years this year and that's a tough thing uh the salary thing TI doesn't quite always do it right well what about our our our financial budget well you you should have a lot of information on a budget then if you're uh i wish i did i i hope you're you're a person who does things better than i i don't have a budget that's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good oh long range planning budget mode um i'm a single mom and i've been just uh trying to get well you you you deserve an honor for that a gold star for that i guess thank you it's nice to have someone understand that right sure how how about yourself do you have a budget you live by well i guess i do i do have a long term budget because i got a daughter in college and one going to be in college so that i've been thinking about that for quite a while now monthly monthly no i'll tell you a funny story about budgeting uh i've been married twenty six years and i did you know that the macho thing the man always did the bills for i don't know fifteen years or more and i got so sick of it trying to balance the budget um-hum uh one and i always tried to show my wife you know here's how you once a year i'd say here's how you do the budget in case i get sick or here's how you do the checks you know right one day i gave her the checkbook and i said i'm not doing this anymore you do it you learn it and i've been happy ever since well that's great how about your she does it all now for about ten years and i don't even she complains to me about it she threatens me to give it back to me and i said i've been a happy man since i haven't fooled with that checkbook you know so i know it's a big pain to try to do that it really is it it really is you know uh that was always a a major problem in our marriage what i have always identified is i am basically good with money it i don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it i think that comes from never having enough you know i'm always afraid of i'm going to need some and where will it be right right oh yeah so um no i i've i've finally worked myself into a spot where i can budget when i when i was first divorced i had um i sat down and budgeted and i had outgo that was what much higher than what i had coming in yes i think uh that is a tough uh we all seems to think seems to be that way i tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me and yeah and so now that i've gotten you know i lost the house now that i've gotten past that i can sit down and say okay this is the reality this is how much money i have each month the scary thing is as far as long term i don't have anything i don't know if you have an IRA or uh you know and i've got two girls also and i haven't saved anything for their college and yeah that's you need to do that i'll i'll i'll give you a hint i don't know if you're a talk a radio talk uh person listener do you listen to radio talk shows sometimes i have listen to Bruce Williams uh for financial advice he's on oh i don't know what he's going to be in Austin he's on five seventy here international oh he's nationally famous um-hum he's a college graduate type guy he's been in all he's an entrepreneur and he gives very practical financial advice about cars very you know not not nothing college level basic stuff his name is Bruce Williams he's on national radio uh i don't know what it would be down there you might want to whatever your radio talk shows are down there he's on that channel it's uh it's five seventy up here well i'll check that out uh-huh and i'd listen to talk shows for everything for gardening and everything just when i'm doing chores and uh he gives a wealth of information very practical stuff and and you've learned a lot he will help you avoid a lot of little things uh financially well that's that's good to know how he yeah there there's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget and i i'm not expert again because i don't really do it monthly um-hum well you must have done something you're you're helping your children in school and you're you know right i did start a college fund i'm not uh i have one again at UT down there now her first year and she's almost gone through her whole college fund you know uh-hum uh-hum excuse me Jim could you hold on i have someone at the door i'll be right back sure go ahead sure thank you i think we might have just screwed up the computer but we'll find out oh no yeah right they give us ten minutes uh uh the only advice i give you on college would be there's a lot of scholarship money out there my daughter got a little bit not much only first year she got about two thousand dollars worth oh and you ought to as your daughters approach the college age uh start finding out about the scholarship money because there is a lot of money out there and uh and and how did your daughter get scholarship money on uh band she got you know five hundred dollars at a at a clip through bands through leadership uh there's all kinds of civic organizations organizations that will give you you know one shot money uh you get a president's award if you're you're in in high school doing certain this up area in Arlington uh there's a lot of and of course you if you you score high on the SAT you can get you know two thousand a year you know or more um-hum wow you can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades she she did very well in school and uh but she only got first year money she got about two thousand dollars it was only five hundred dollars at a clip from this organization uh-hum we called there were there were two or three people there was some little civic organization in Dallas that gave money away and only two or three people applied she applied and got five hundred dollars from that wow oh i'm definitely going to be uh actively looking into that so look into that bit the year that they graduate you know before though you know while they're graduating there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything and they don't even have a dozen applicants because uh uh the kids are going off after the big money um-hum uh of course you have to have some sort of record in high school uh of of achievement and everything but sometimes it's just uh like our band gave money away we're a band booster club we gave we give uh two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids uh who we think were worthy you know so well that's great to know there's money out there yeah that's good go ahead you can talk i i don't want to i want to chew up the whole line here oh well you're doing you're doing just fine and and uh actually i when i talk i usually like to ask a lot of questions i was wondering what you do at TI oh i'm an engineer i'm uh in fact i'm working the night uh because of the cutbacks and everything uh my job there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved and so they put me on nights i i call this my recession job and i'm working nights just kind of cov ering uh shutdown equipment and everything and just being available here i don't mind oh goodness um-hum um-hum uh it beats being laid off and everything and uh you you got to be a little flexible uh in my old age i'm trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school oh absolutely yeah and then i'd like to teach maybe mathematics or something i'm trying to study for that now oh i hope you can do that what what i did is i was approached and and i've i went to TI just right at the time that uh my marriage was ending i had been a right uh a stay at home mom and and i i was very fortunate in starting and i really enjoyed it while i was at TI but you know the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening and i had less than five years um-hum and also i wanted to make a little bit more money so i decided i'd like to go out and try sales and uh i'm i'm out trying to sell oh yeah telephone systems to businesses and the potential there is fantastic the reality of it is it's tough right oh sure well it's tough right now for everybody up here in the Dallas Metroplex it's awful hey i've got another clue for you for college exactly um-hum another clue for you for college money go to work for UT okay uh we have a friend who works who is a secretary for TCU you know up here they give you scholarship a hundred percent yes if you're if you work for TCU they do yes so check that one out you know i'm going to check that i've got i've got two friends that work at at UT i didn't know that at all definitely i will ask them about it call them and because it's full full scholarship now it's uh not room and board but it's tuition full tuition paid if your parent works at TCU uh-huh well that sounds fantastic and her her her uh mother went over there just for that  hey Dick who's your favorite team i think i'm going to have to go with the Chicago Bears oh how come well i like Mike Ditka oh yeah and um of course i used to like Jim McMahon and you know uh Walter Payton yeah but they got rid of them but i still like Ditka and i think they've got still got a pretty good team if they could just find a real good quarterback yeah they really uh uh they found out that all the guys that were backing up uh McMahon when they got to be the first guys weren't all that good after all yeah i was kind of i was i was disappointed they came along pretty good but but they just didn't have anybody that could actually go in there and win the game yeah Tomczak was was trying hard but he just can't do it yeah and or they found that Tomczak really wasn't a he was a good backup quarterback was what he was he's not a starter yeah yeah he wasn't the guy to take them take them to the championship so i'm hoping maybe they'll draft a good quarterback this year i don't know who they're gonna get but i hope yeah i don't i don't know what's out there for quarterbacks and they've got a what about a mid a mid first round choice i think yeah they don't have much in the way of rounds but who knows if they don't get one maybe they can trade for one after all you know i New Orleans picked up uh old uh Steve Montana or Walsh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Steve Walsh who's your favorite team yeah he had had had sort of mixed success with them uh when he was there but i think he'll be okay once he gets on well i i think once he goes into training camp with them and gets a full year at uh to do it it it'll work out okay for him i uh you know i uh he didn't have a chance here in Dallas because my gosh Aikman was the number one choice number one draft choice uh and with a long term six year contract and a bunch of and a bunch of money oh yeah and they were paying him a lot of money so Walsh yeah Walsh didn't have that much uh well as you probably guessed i'm a Cowboy fan uh more or less gee that's too bad and well it's hard uh because that's too bad it must get a long time between thrills yeah uh i was here in nineteen sixty well i got to go back that i moved down from Pittsburgh in in fifty nine and uh in fifty eight i really became a pro football fan went to all the Steelers home games uh-huh and they finished second that year i guess and it was Bobby Lane's first it was the year that Bobby Lane got traded to them two games into the season uh-huh uh so that's where i started cutting my teeth on the NFL and then i got to Dallas and we didn't have any NFL in fifty nine so i sat and watched uh watched it on television then at the end of the fifty nine season when they announced we're gonna get a team in sixty i went out and bought two season tickets and i was in the first twelve season ticket holders good grief for the Cowboys you still got them uh yeah except i don't use them well uh then what happened so we go a little bit further than that uh and i uh uh i was single then later i got married and i had my two season tickets and they were in the Cotton Bowl in the first row in the upper deck on the fifty yard line uh which was really nice and uh in the early days uh you know ten twelve fourteen thousand people i'm talking about sixty through about sixty four uh-huh yeah uh was what we got i also bought season tickets to the Dallas Texans football team which is now the Kansas City Chiefs ah the old Kansas City Chiefs yeah and i and i may have been the only one that did both because the mentality in Dallas was that you couldn't like both you had to like one and hate the other oh yeah and and it was interesting because the AFL uh when when the Chiefs when the Texans were playing they would give the scores of the Cowboy games and the NFL games but the NFL refused to admit they existed so when the Cowboys were playing you never got the scores of their games huh and it you know it was the Lamar Hunt crowd versus the Clint Murchison crowd and uh and the the popular joke around Dallas was that after the sixty two season uh in fact i went down to Houston in sixty two and watched them win the AFL championship uh after the sixty two season Murchison and Hunt got together and flipped a coin and the loser had to stay and uh then in uh uh sixty uh uh let's see sixty nine when they decided to build the new stadium in Irving uh they let the uh uh they let the fans build it i mean it wasn't built with any tax payer money uh they floated bonds that the that the season ticket holders had to buy to maintain their status as season ticket holders so what was neat is you got to choose the tickets based on your seniority as a season ticket holder and uh so i had a first choice and uh i got in the upper tier uh well actually there was two types of seats there were two hundred and fifty dollar bonds and thousand dollar bonds that you had to buy good grief and so i got the first choice of the two hundred and fifty dollar bonds so i was in the upper deck in the twelfth row on the fifty yard line i wonder if that guy that's in the eleventh row see he bought thousand dollar bonds huh that guy so uh that happened then uh ultimately i had uh i got transferred overseas by TI i'm with TI and i got transferred overseas yeah uh through most of the eighties so i each each year i just sold my tickets i had some people take custody of my tickets for me i served uh three years four years in Malaysia and three in the Philippines huh and uh now i got back i got kids in college and gosh i can't afford that price so i still keep them in my name but the guy who takes them calls me every year and says can i have the tickets one more year i say yeah fine take them so i still hold them but i don't go oh that's too bad but uh the the funny thing about the Cowboys is is that everybody is really enthused because we've got all these umpteen jillion draft choices and uh but when you look back on the team uh uh except for probably Emmett Smith nobody that's been drafted in the last twelve years is a starter no i'm kind of uh actually uh i think they've got the draft choices to make to make a good run at it but i i'm not sure how well they'll draft well if you don't make smart selections it doesn't do any good or if you make smart selections and they and you can't sign them yeah they're they're having trouble doing a little bit of both yeah well i heard Jerry Jones say something interesting and i and i it must border on legality or ethnicity on draft day he's got about thirty people that are going out to their potential players and when it comes their time to choose they get thirty minutes or so these people will negotiate with the players and get them to sign a contract and if they won't sign a contract they won't draft them huh and and they will take the time allotted to make their choices to do that so you you got thirty minutes to make your decision then and uh uh yeah because see last year their first two draft choices were uh Alex uh Emmett Smith and Alexander Wright and they didn't get either of them until half way through the season and they didn't get to go through training camp with them yeah well Smith came on pretty good Wright was yeah Smith came on pretty good Wright is is still in the in the potential category Wright didn't do much everybody likes his speed but he can't catch the ball and it doesn't do him much good to run down field if he can't catch the ball no no no but but you know that's where Bob Hayes was in his early days too so i'll be interested to see how they do of course actually i was in Dallas in of course i worked for TI too for a while hum and i left them i guess in eighty two but i was in Dallas there when uh Roger Staubach and oh yeah all the bunches up there and yeah well those were the glory years the seventies were absolutely and uh i got so tired i i guess i just got so tired of hearing about the Dallas Cowboys and and you know whatever whatever the Cowboys did that day that it just kind of turned me against them yeah yeah and and and and and the seventies were really a it it saw the team's emergence as a super power coincided with the movement to Texas Stadium uh-huh uh and the movement to Texas Stadium came along about the fifth game of uh of the seventy one season and that was the year they went to the Super Bowl and beat Miami yeah in the Super Bowl the previous year that they'd finished in the Cotton Bowl they did go to the Super Bowl and got beat by Baltimore in in the in the last second or two but uh i mean in the seventies it was play-offs every year i had some friends of mine well i guess it's it's some friends of my parents uh lived in Dallas and of course they're avid you know just avid Cowboys fans and uh they have this uh little mini Winnebago that they take out there on game day oh yeah there's so many people do that and uh we used and uh we used to uh my first wife and i used to go out with them all the time because every Sunday you know the yeah Cowboys there they had like four tickets yeah they they they had four tickets because their kids were there of course their kids came and went yeah but uh every time the kids didn't go we'd go and we'd go out there and just you know at at like ten o'clock in the morning and set up and there would be all these people gathered around that you know all the tailgaters and stuff and then everybody would wander into the stadium you know well i own four tickets i might i told you i had two i actually own four and in seventy one the year they moved into the stadium i bought two more because i had uh two children and they were very little and we just ended up taking the neighbors kids who were teenagers because our i thought that ultimately my own would want to go and the way the stadium was selling out in season tickets it might be totally sold out which it never did but uh uh at twenty nine dollars a pop now let's see six four's is uh-huh that's a hundred and sixteen dollars is it that much four hundred dollars goodness damn and another five for parking so that's a hundred and twenty one dollars and with two kids in college and the potential of having three there next September uh i you know i'm going to watch them on television for a few years uh yeah i would imagine speaking of that what are your Cowboys going to do for backup quarterback uh boy they don't have one uh we sure figured out that old Babe Wassenberg didn't make it yeah they they sure they sure found out in a hurry that Babe Wassenberg wasn't it didn't they yeah he was pretty good staying on the sidelines with his clipboard but he wasn't he wasn't worth a damn in the game yeah but you know it's it's interesting because old uh uh you know everybody said when they signed Steve Wal boy they're going to have to trade him they're going to have to trade him but you cannot seriously contend uh in the league without two front line quarterbacks you know and and and you know the years that we were good we had Staubach and Morton are you up there too now the one that wasn't playing the one that wasn't playing was pissed off most of the time but nevertheless in in over three or four seasons both those guys went down with with severe injuries and the other guy stepped in and they didn't never lost a lick uh-huh but they were still bet your money paid if somebody sent me you know i i guess being an athlete of course i played in high school and college yeah yeah and i can understand you know wanting to play but of course as i get more seniority on earth huh i kind of wonder you know gosh if i could sit on the bench and earn five hundred thousand dollars a year i'd just be happy to sit there yeah yeah and uh that last championship they won in the Super Bowl Craig Martin was the only guy in the entire squad that did not get in the game but he got his winner's share  views huh political views huh well just any any political event or view or anything well i think Bush done screwed up well uh in what way well as far as like the the people over there he told them to uprising have a uprising you know and overtake Saddam so now that they're listening he's not helping them i don't think he ever told them to to rise up against Saddam Hussein yeah that's what he said when it first started that they should think about what they're doing and and you know what he's doing that they should you know make him understand it it's just like them saying that we should understand what Bush is doing but they don't have no say so in it i guess well unfortunately the the United States as a government can't get involved in a civil war in another country because it's not it it's well that's what Vietnam was was a civil war that's what get you know it's like a double double standard well you know i'm i uh the uh the Kurdish in the northern part of Iraq unfortunately when the the uh Mid Eastern countries were when the boundaries were adjusted and changed and all the Kurdish were basically forgotten because there's a group of Kurdish in Northern Iraq there's some in uh Western Iran and there's some in Southern Turkey oh yeah and uh well that's where he bombed before with the Turks that's where he put the chemical weapons before um-hum and killed all them people what's uh Saddam did yeah it it's just unfortunate that the Kurdish people didn't get their own uh land or something well their their own government or their own something originally um yeah now they have to deal with whatever they get dished out more or less taken on from each side because they're getting it from like Turkey closed their borders um-hum you know so i think they're screwed up there yeah they've they've got plenty of problems without the Iraqi problem uh-huh and then Iran i don't know if they can go to Iran or not that wasn't the the Iranian borders are still open uh from what i understand understand um David the Iraqis the Kurdish are going into Iran to Iran and into Syria i know that the Saudi the uh that Saudi Arabia has some pretty strict yeah uh now they have yeah they're pretty strict anyway yeah and i doubt that they're letting too many Iraqis in uh-huh unless the people have proof that they're leaving that they're not going to stay yeah i don't even think that will help right now because you never know who's on whose side and they're worried about that and they could get over there and change their mind or something you know who knows then the Saudi Arabians will just shoot them yeah now that's something i like about the country there's not a whole lot of crime over there as far as petty crime you know they well they it's a it's all the countries over there are very wealthy yeah and so most of the people are wealthy and and they don't have some most of their basic needs for for food and shelter and clothing are met so they don't have any yeah uh any need that's going to drive them to to petty theft or or to that type of crime i wish it was as good over here as it is over there but if you're the yeah but those uh those countries are so extremely wealthy but from what i understand though that it's private it's the same type of wealth distribution where you have a the very few are very wealthy yeah but since there's so much more to go around that that leaves the the lower classes with more yeah that's better than none at all i guess yeah they don't have no crime so you think that that George Bush's foreign policy is poor because of because of what's happening to the Kurdish people they no i just think i don't know if he should have made that statement other than that you know he's all right you know but i don't know i'm not a Bush fan i'm not really none of them's fan i just wish something else could be done in this country i don't know what something else done here that would would solve the problems in the Mid East or or no that would solve our own problems i don't know i think the war was good to a point but then it really didn't help us any you know no other than than reestablishing the dominance of the United States in the in the world economy you know yeah that's it that's all that's that the to let the world know that we could do what we say we was going to that's about it another thing that was good if you're looking at the balance of the super powers between the United States and the Soviet Union you know the United States went in and led the battle and and solved the problem and the Soviet Union is is a whimpering is a whimpering country right now because they they've got so many problems that they can't even now they now they have an internal problem themselves right now and i think that has to do with them having problems with food and and and and prices and all of that stuff yeah yeah a lot of their their civil problems where they've got their uh Baltic states rising against the the uh the leadership in in the Russian state um-hum uh is the same type of deal as what occurred with the Kurdish people it's the same type of situation where they they want their own their where where ethnic groups were split up and and our and don't necessarily have the same uh social structure or value systems as the government yep it's i it's it's kind of fortunate that that the United States was founded in the way that it did because it's such a mixture of people oh goodness yes with with for the most part with the same ideals yeah more or less just whatever it it's really that choice yeah and and that's the biggest that's the bottom line is it's your choice it's not told to you or pushed on you it's whatever choice you want to make you can make it yourself yeah and and when the when the United States was founded the people the people who founded the country all had the same value systems and beliefs and so immigrants coming in understood that and and it wasn't as if it was forced upon them they chose to come to this country yeah it wasn't as if a a new government was established when they were already here um-hum so well i think we've taken up at least five minutes i've enjoyed talking t o you all righty bye-bye bye  okay so uh what do you think about it well um i guess i i'm more concerned about public safety than i am about the um the concern for the private uh the idea of preserving privacy for the individual um because i can't really see why anyone privacy right um who has nothing to hide would object well there is always the uh the possibility even remote as it is of uh of mistaken uh of that's of course that is certainly true yeah yeah and see that bothers me i'm i'm a i mean i'm i'm very much for drug testing um-hum uh i really am i mean i'm going i'm going to take the negative side just for a second just to do it sure um see i have to take uh medication for a uh for for kidney transplant and i'm going to be taking that the rest of my life now you i don't know how that's going to affect uh uh-huh sure if you had to have a drug test yeah right i mean i haven't had one yet um TI i work for Texas Instruments and and uh we you know we do have the random drug testing but i've missed it so far but i mean it in the back of my mind it always bothers me and what happens if it you know if it um-hum um-hum if they catch it they think that i'm you know i'm on drugs and they send me and and have me uh you know go through this this thing you know yeah checked out or whatever i but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that um i agree that that some innocent person might be victimized by a false test but i would think that um that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that for example that one uh positive would not be uh accepted as an automatic um reason for whatever they might be going to do if they found a positive uh dismissal or treatment or whatever right but that that what it would do is it would trigger perhaps uh one or two more stages where further tests could be taken uh done um-hum because um there are there must be people like you or in other circumstances that could come up with with uh false positives for certain kind of drugs on the other hand um i think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested oh yeah because of the of their responsibility for the public welfare and certainly people in uh industries well the transportation industry for specifically uh you know specifically but um in many many cases um-hum no yeah whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs it's not even going to effect anybody but his uh you know himself and his own family perhaps um depending on the kind of drug he might be on but um and eventually that's going to show up anyway right in the way he works and so on but there's so many things that it would make a difference i guess i um-hum i uh i would not want to have anyone in my family uh victimized by someone who you know a a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that who um you know hadn't been tested right well i you know i'm like i said i'm i'm very much pro testing um and and this is why yeah uh number one is i i'm i'm kind of i know this sounds like a slogan for the government but i you know we are in a war against drugs i mean yeah sure it's it's horrible i mean you don't know whether the person sitting next to you anywhere is on drugs or not um-hum um-hum and it takes some drastic steps at this point and i think personally the drastic step has to be that um that you can't work if you continue taking drugs i mean it's as simple as that i mean make it so yeah make it difficult enough well make it uh make not necessarily difficult but make it so that it's not glamorous yeah yeah i mean it's glamorous taking drugs or at least it seems that way yeah according to what you you hear the people who um have serious problems i mean we have um really i guess we're kind of lucky we really only know of one um yeah young man who uh who's a family they go to our church and it's the son and so on and he was friends with my children um-hum um and he's really the only one that i know of personally who got himself really messed up um having having been involved with drugs but i know of a number of other people who have you know gotten all messed up most of these are young people i work in the education system and so i have a little more contact with that but um um-hum the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking and he may never really be um-hum a productive member of society But sadder than that he may never be able to have a normal happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are are almost uncontrollable i mean he he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that you know he he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not hum i mean he's you know he's so messed up right and um this was a nice sweet young man who teenager you know and he's now a young man about twenty i guess who um just got really down the wrong path and uh you know i don't know that that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing right but seeing what drugs did to him makes me see makes me realize what it could do to people you know in the work force as well um-hum um it's horrible well then let's let's answer the second half of the question what limits ought to be put on it do you think well the limits uh uh would i think have to do with what i'd alluded to before that there needs to be a further um that that one positive on a drug test would not um-hum constitute uh dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might uh have set up for those who genuinely have a problem in other words there needs to be um more than um-hum treatment before for dismissal type thing pardon yes right there needs to be more than one test and there needs to be some some measure of uh certainty before anything drastic happens there are lots of things that are involved there um such as perhaps insurance um-hum um-hum uh you know denial of insurance for someone um and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this um that would that you know it would be unfair and people who are on medication for example or um even even people who might be of the gay community and i'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society but um i think that there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination because it makes a bigger problem right um so it seems to me that that um there needs to be some ground you know some rules that protect um-hum i'm not sure though when we talk about what rules if any that we should say well certain segments should not have to be tested i really don't see why personally i think that's what i was about to say is that everyone needs to be tested and yeah yeah i don't i don't know why it would be you know um bad to test just everyone and it may be you know it's not feasible to do everyone but certainly random testing the fact that people know that that they that it could happen um-hum yeah would be some measure of protection but the bottom line is that that if if you're going to stay clean and straight then um you're you're going to do that because you want to really right well there's yeah there there's going to be some measure of incentive uh reward or whatever but the reward ultimately ultimately comes down to what you want yeah so i i've got to agree with that so um hum no that's very true well it sounds like we agree anyway yeah i think so i think we i think we did pretty good yeah well all right well uh i guess that's about it i guess if that's all we've done and i guess we've talked long enough all right it was nice talking to you it was it was talk nice talking to you too okay bye-bye all right bye-bye  okay are are you an exercise fanatic are you well i'm sort of an exercise fanatic i'm big on swimming oh really yeah well that's way north too i guess you have to swim inside huh yeah i uh i i i find i do more swimming in the wintertime than i do in the summer really yeah wow uh my wife has a sailboat so i wind up on the sailboat a lot in the summertime um-hum but it's the winter months that i can get serious about swimming oh well that's good that's that's one of the best ones i understand no stress on the joints well it winds up being a little stress on the shoulder joints after a while yeah i guess so but as far as the weight bearing yeah well i find that uh if i want to lose some weight that uh i can't do it unless i exercise as well yeah that's true plus even if you lose weight and don't exercise it ends up just looking you know looking unhealthy yeah well last year i had a campaign to lose about uh twenty pounds and uh i wound up swimming about three hundred and sixty miles during the year wow do you swim like at a at a Y or yes uh Fairfax County has uh a number of uh park authority uh recreation centers and all of them have uh at least a twenty five meter or twenty five yard uh swimming pool oh and in fact out here in Oakton we have uh there's a fifty meter uh pool called Oakmar and it's sort of a uh uh a landmark pool it's a very uh excellent design you know top rated pool hm and good uh gallery facilities for competitive uh events and things like that really is it like Olympic size it's Olympic size yes wow are you are you a TI employee no i uh work for E-Systems what which is which is another Dallas company but i'm at the uh Melpar division here in uh Falls Church yeah well the reason i ask you i i'm a TI employee and uh we have a fitness center you know that's on site hum that makes it real real convenient because i tend to find that once i get home that's it you know yeah i tend to not want to go anywhere after that but this way you know you can go to the fitness center right from work and they have aerobics and you know all this machines and all that sort of stuff we're not we're not high rollers like Dallas we don't have a pool but yeah yeah well i have we have a uh recreation center which is almost right across the street from our uh office oh that's good and so i hit there at seven o'clock in the morning get in a half hour swim and still make it to work on time oh that's great yeah morning is usually a better time to exercise but i usually find that after work is when i have the time to do it um well i get to put work after work i i have to hurry home and uh and help out with the kids and you have honeydews yeah fix things around the house and all those kind of chores honeydews so the morning hour is my time to myself yeah well that's great i i like to to work out some in the morning but it's not like you know i usually use the video or something like that to do oh you plus i like to dance you know oh you do the aerobic uh dancing then um-hum um-hum and and on Saturdays i go to a jazzercise class that's my yeah well that looks that looks like so much work to me i oh it's fun jazzercise is really fun yeah but you put out a lot of energy uh keeping up that pace yeah there there's a lot of energy i i i like to belly dance too but there's not the same you know you don't get the aerobic yeah workout as much but jazzercise is what it's it's so much fun that you forget you're exercising you know aerobics you don't forget hum you know you're exercising oh and we started the bench aerobics too i don't know if you've seen that i haven't seen that no that's a fairly new thing it's just like uh one step yeah you know it's like a box and you just step up and down and up and down and up down do different variations you know change feet and and you'd be surprised how quick that gets the pulse rate up oh okay it's a it's a lot quicker and and that way it's completely low impact here's no jumping or you know no jarring on the knee bones yeah i i see some of these exercise machines that uh it looks like you're constantly walking up stairs yeah uh-huh and uh i think that should get your heart rate right up there at the maximum and keep it there yeah that will do it yeah we have one of those too but it's boring yeah yeah i can see that well i a lot of people complain about swimming that that's uh boring oh but that wouldn't be boring like walking up stairs but i find that uh over over the years i've developed the ability to keep track of my uh workout and at the same time uh do some creative thinking while i'm swimming yeah so i i can write letters to congressman and uh organize reports and uh right well do you count your laps or do you just have a time segment that you i i count them i i swim a sixteen fifty every day and uh so that's sixty six lengths of the pool jeez and uh i sometimes i may not be conscious of keeping count but uh you know every now and then when i do check up and say where is my count i check it relative to the clock and and i also wind up coming out even even side of the pool yeah yeah well that's neat do you do you look forward to doing it or do you sometimes have to force yourself until you get started i usually uh look forward to it uh and in fact some mornings i uh almost feel a necessity yeah to uh to get out and uh go for the swim i think uh there is something to this endorphins yeah uh thing but uh when i'm exercising regularly i i feel the need to to do more exercise um-hum and then when you don't for some reason you feel real lethargic yeah it seems like like the the the less you exercise the tireder you are i'm sorry um-hum yeah yeah that's true sometimes i find i have to kick myself though to get started and once i get started you know it's it feels good and yeah well sometimes sometimes uh i've had the effect that if i swim in the morning uh i get an urge to go back and swim again at lunch time wow do you have time to do that in your job and just barely it amounts to running out the back door and uh heading for the pool jumping in swimming some sprints or something like that and then running back again course you probably i have i have waist length hair so you probably don't have that problem yeah you know that's a problem with with getting getting that much wet um-hum but well i've i've lost most of my hair so that's no real problem oh then nobody really complains if i uh if i come in sort of half wet yeah well gee well that sounds neat and you do that like like almost every day or what about weekends almost every day i uh this spring has been uh a little hard to keep up the pace because uh we've had a lot of family activities my wife has taken up skiing oh and uh she she twisted water skiing or snow skiing snow skiing she did water skiing when she was uh young oh um-hum and uh i think she was uh pretty competitive at one point she had a bad accident that uh put her out of competition oh really uh but she's taking up snow skiing and she got me involved oh that's good exercise so i was out there you know stark terror coming down the side of the hill God really and we had another expedition where we took the three little kids up and uh taught them to ski how how old are your kids are they and uh seven eight and ten oh that's a good age to start something like that yeah it was it was delightful watching them uh learn they uh they went out with their individual personalities and picked it up in their own little way um-hum uh the one we thought would be the most timid uh turned out to be the one that stuck with it and was the first to learn really and the other two got jealous and they went out and says well i'm going to go and do it too so so they learned too little competition there and uh we went to a good resort and the instructors were there uh took a liking to the kids so next thing you know they're they've got the kids off on the uh some of the bigger slopes really did they have a separate uh like class or something for the kids or is it everybody together the place where we went has a separate area for beginners it's called the Sun Bowl um-hum and they just put instructors out there and you you sign up for instruction and they just give you an arm band and if you see an instructor who's not doing anything you just tap him on the shoulder and ask him questions and they'll show you things oh and so they're pretty much available all day long um-hum and you can either take instruction or practice or or just enjoy yourself whatever you like yeah and the instructors are very enthusiastic and of course they picked up the kids and and took them on some of the more advanced slopes yeah did you all start this year or last year uh yes my wife did some last year um-hum and got started and so she grabbed me by the ear and made me do it this year do you all have have you had a good snow this year we were lucky um we were going to Seven Springs up in Pennsylvania and the first time we went up there the instructor said that was the first uh really good weekend that they'd had this year really and uh Charlotte went up in the uh middle of the season  so do you have any hobbies well right at the present time nothing real special i kind of like gardening and i'm kind of into camping and you know vacationing that sort of thing i don't have any real serious yeah uh i'm an avid gardener um oh okay i think you're um i consider that a hobby i don't know they were like suggesting like handcraft things which i guess that's a really true true hobby um-hum yeah i i i think anything that you enjoy um it doesn't really have to matter i mean it could be working on cars could be your hobby really yeah well yeah i kind of enjoy doing that a little bit too well did i no i i guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation then yeah well i don't know i told my husband i said you go out some to work on the car it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong i says you go pay to have someone do it yeah because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something i guess as far north as you are if you like gardening you've still got a couple months to go haven't you oh yeah um well right now we um start our seeds inside uh-huh oh yeah that's right you would yeah we'll start them inside and uh in cold frames or whatever the yeah well we usually start them right in the house my sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck and um-hum and the wind a wind storm come and knock it down but she's had really good luck i mean it next month well actually it if you if you start it in a couple weeks huh and you can get your plants outside pretty much the end of May you can leave them outside you might put them in the ground just the first week of June uh-huh yeah but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of May yeah i've i've lived in in Texas and New Mexico most of my life but i did once i spent one winter in North Dakota oh and i i remember that it was on into May before it really started warming up yeah well well we live we live really close to Lake Champlain which is in the Champlain Valley so we're a little we're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts so and uh oh yeah okay because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit yeah yeah we are a little lucky well my brother lives ten miles from here and he gets frost and his crop gets killed you're at yeah you're right across the uh lake from what Plattsburgh yep from Plattsburgh Air Force Base oh yeah yeah yeah i had i had a cousin that was stationed there but um Plattsburgh for a while he he remembers lots of snow yeah Plattsburgh's kind of a it's uh it's uh depressed economically oh really oh when you go across the lake um i don't know why we have so much going for us i really don't i'm just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at Digital and they've never had well they've had layoffs recently but when we got hired here no no never any layoffs never never yeah and now we're looking at serious i i mean i'm a technician when they start getting rid of technicians yeah yeah well i'm i'm working for TI Texas Instruments down here well i interviewed with them but i didn't want to go to Texas oh yeah oh even though my um mother's people are from Georgia oh yeah yeah well i guess we have to get back to hobbies since yeah we're getting to where straying i guess yeah stick on the subject well interesting thing that i do is with gardening uh my sister grows flowers that you can dry um-hum and you can make flower uh dried flower arrangements and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun and we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with uh dried red flowers and dried white flowers and uh eucalyptus hum yeah you you know what eucalyptus is it's yeah yeah the they sell uh it's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries it's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it but yeah it's got a smell yeah at first i'm like oh how why do people like this but it it is kind of a nice smell after a while people put them in yeah i didn't realize what it was for a while i'd walk into a room where some of that and i'd wonder what is that you know and then one day i i realized that it was eucalyptus yeah it's it's it's like a fad thing i i don't know it's i've never heard of it in the last five years i've used so much of it that yes yeah i hate to that's the stuff that koala bears eat in Australia or something yeah it is maybe that's why they're so slow i guess they're stoned on the stuff or something yeah it it looks really potent potent stuff yeah but uh it's yeah i think it's the greatest stuff in the world though it's jeez they i make all kinds of things with it we make all kinds of things just with dried flowers i i almost want to start a business doing it but i don't i i'm so uh timid when it comes to starting a business yeah that's that's a big step yeah yeah it is especially with the being in on the creative aspect aspect on the crafty end yeah uh you know after a while you make some stuff then you start looking at it go boy this this is kind of ugly but i know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby um he does it believe it or not i wouldn't imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife um hum because he's a seasonal worker he works in the construction and up here it's almost a pattern i mean you see your fathers do it then their sons do it what they do is they work construction then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter yeah and uh this guy was going nuts and his uh son built him a garage and got him some uh oh i don't know what the equipment's called but planes and thi ngs um-hum shapes and planes and and set set him up and he he makes all kinds of furniture for um his kids and he makes uh uh like little kids' furniture routers he gets right into it and uh there was a program on TV down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little little companies of one and two guys you know up there especially this particular one i think was in Maine and New Hampshire where out in the just kind of out in these little towns they'd be i n they may be the same kind of people you're talking about you know they've they've got twelve weeks to do something and they they're making furniture and just you know things like that during the winter and then they go off and do other things during the summer yeah it's a it's a really good thing so yeah yeah yeah yeah because it's keeping him sane and plus it's keeping his marriage so and and plus he's getting on in his years now he's he's not that old but he's getting yeah yeah to the point where he needed an extra boost to to do something like that and uh it's really it's it's uh hard work i couldn't imagine taking lumber raw lumber and trying to make something out of it he dowels yeah that would be really tough you know like say the he dowels everything and it's all got to line up and uh i don't think he goofs too much i don't to see too much scrap around oh man yeah yeah yeah that's that's something now our temperatures down here we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties and uh so and uh so as far as you know planting outdoor stuff matter of fact tonight i just got through i was planting some some trees out back tonight and uh God i'm envious this is uh it's really nice out tonight almost hated to come in is it going to be is it going to be really dry it are you plant are no i always plant trees in the fall i don't know why so the the cold weather can kill them yeah these were uh trees that that wintered but i guess i don't don't know where they came from they come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that and they come down here and they'll sit in the nurseries here and they'll go ahead and and uh leaf out so what i'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that's or trees that are already leafed out oh that's good i guess they they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall um yeah mostly i think in a place where it's really cold they do it in the fall let them winter yeah yeah through the fall but uh down here well it's done both ways it it just kind of depends on what you're what you're planting but uh all the shrubs and yeah and uh when you have time to do it yeah my sister does uh flower gardens she gets right into it uh-huh she spends lots of money on them and i guess a lot of people do do do that they landscape their whole house with flower gardens she's got like yeah just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and bulch bark uh tree bark all over her lawn yeah flowers during the summer down here the the normal kind of flowers there's very few of them that'll really do well everything does real well here in the spring until about oh first part of June and then the real the heat sets in it gets it and June July August are you know most of the those kind of plants just are just barely staying alive let alone make flowers do you have a lot of shade trees around your house or is it uh we're in a relatively new area we're kind of out of uh the natural tree area we're kind of up on a on a higher on a slope so you don't have a lot of tree coverage so we don't have where we are right now there are very few trees this was this was this was pasture land but down the down the hill here a little ways there are parks that are look like jungles you know they're really because going going to make yeah see um where uh where my uh well my grandmother passed away but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees and they just shade everything um-hum now where is this uh it's in Georgia it's yeah it's right outside of Macon and and it's just a i like the way that i like the way that idea of the south is in Georgia yeah yeah but when i think of Texas i think of nothing but no trees and just grass well i tell you what now see East Texas there's two parts of Texas East Texas and North Texas Atlanta and Dallas are almost identical in every way weather and everything yeah the two cities are very very identical so if you were familiar with Atlanta so it's that dry heat uh uh well no it's it's uh not dry at all it it's humid well where is it is it Houston wasn't it Houston's humid Houston Houston is awful yeah Houston is really humid now it's humid  okay there we go well uh what do you think about taxes do you think we're paying too much yes and no income tax no i uh i look at it this way uh you've got to pay for the privilege of living here um-hum but uh being a uh a rec vehicle owner well in fact i live in a motor home i'm a full what they call a full timer and uh it burns gas like crazy i only get seven miles to the gallon i really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes and they call it uh uh what's the word they use anyway a luxury a luxury tax yeah they gave add it on on to tires and gasoline cigarettes liquor and it doesn't bother me any because i've quit drinking and i quit smoking so that doesn't bother me but i don't think it's fair it's it's too um yeah um it's attacking just certain people how true and even with the gasoline tax yeah well gasoline especially in this part of the country we all use it all the time you know it's that's not what i would consider a luxury no uh fifty years ago the automobile was a luxury but it's a necessity today and uh as hard as they try to get these public transit things going i have never seen nor heard of one that uh really really got of the ground yeah or that accomplish what they set out to accomplish to accomplish what are your feelings on it well um i i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and how it's being managed and so forth i mean i i think there could be a better system and we would get more for our money it's totally out of our hands so we don't we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes and and yeah that that's that's so true i mean they say well you voice your opinion uh uh uh on election day but not really no you don't look what happened on the last presidential election read my lips and what happened they turned around and double crossed us yeah so uh i mean you you can't believe what you what you hear well i think too one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by Congress and that don't seem to have any validity at all i mean they're always far out and uh you know they're studying some obscure uh bug you know in some other part of the world or some such thing and and our tax money pays for those things and i think that's wrong oh uh yes i i agree and and uh uh i also think we extend too much help to other uh countries we need enough help here in this country that's right they're still people starving people here why should we help starving people somewhere else yeah and i think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize that we're the nation in trouble absolutely absolutely now i can't wait for uh i i could just picture what's what's going to happen here in the not to distant future we keep hearing well we're going to receive uh eight billion dollars from Japan for the uh uh uh the uh uh the the the big war over there in the Mideast the war um-hum and uh so many billions of dollars here and there and everything and uh the next thing you know we'll be turning turning around just like we did to Poland and say well just forget it yeah and i think that's a mistake somewhere somewhere you know we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away oh definitely well another thing now they they keep the decontrolling different things first it was the airlines then it was banks and and uh um savings association and what not we know what trouble they got into exactly and the same with the airlines back in the days when they were uh controlled and and uh uh transcontinental or um um um um interstate uh trucking i mean as soon as the uh the federal government gave up control on all that they just went to hell in a hand basket yeah uh prices went uh sky high you know in the in the case of airlines of course they became highly competitive and they cut each others throats until they're they're reach the point where they're cutting their own throat and uh well of course that's getting away from taxes isn't it that that's government controlled but um well i i think another thing too that um i've had a little contacted with uh in regard to taxes let's say that um you have something that the IRS disagrees with or you know says hey we're not going to allow that well i think they're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you you will not only pay back that that you wrote off but you will at least double that amount and oh by the time you get through with the uh yes and that's to me there's something wrong there you know the penalties yeah i mean i can see paying the interest and some small penalty but they really stick it to you big time uh i agree i think the IRS is uh just too powerful there should be some sort of a control on it and they should be a little more humane um-hum absolutely uh the um well typical bureaucratic i guess uh that's that's one of my pet peeves i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the uh the budget um-hum very simple give uh uh uh government employees the average number of of uh holidays as the uh uh the private industry yeah i mean you think about it now they they get about sixteen holidays a year that's a lot it sure is and i think here at TI we get what is it nine or ten well i haven't counted i i would have guessed eight even but you might be right i don't have any idea well i remember uh thinking i think it was the last time i did hear that we get about the average maybe even a little more a day or so more than the average yeah but uh government is ridiculous wow just think of the money they could save i mean they're they're paying out this money anyway yeah why not get the work out of the people yeah and well anyway that would of course eventually come back to taxes but uh as far as income tax is concerned i can't complain too much about it um i'm single i have no uh dependents or anything my children are all grown and they're out worrying about their own income taxes yeah well i i have another thing that i thought about too um for instance when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is and you know we're not typically talking about big dollars but here you feel like you've you've done something good you've you've earned your interest and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it so the real amount of your savings on that is is not much um very true that's you know it's kind of a vicious circle there and then they tell you to uh well invest it in uh is it IRA's or something and and when and then they took that away as far as when you turn being when you turn sixty five why then you pay the tax on it and the tax is a lot less yeah but in the mean time you used used them you've got your money tide up in a low relatively low interest uh bearing investment i mean it's not making ten fifteen percent like a business is today huh-uh um me i'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it well you can come over to my house and spend it well you i wish i had some to spend well do you do you need some help spending yours no no i don't i just don't have any oh oh uh-huh well that's my problem too i'm i'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid yeah that's the way it goes well i guess we probably talked just about long enough um-hum yeah uh let me ask you something did you get a catalog or something from these people yet yes you did uh-huh i've everybody i've talked to has received one and i haven't gotten mine i don't know um well anyway Ellen it was nice talking to you you too and uh until next time okay good-bye bye-bye  okay well i haven't uh you know when the war was on i watched um CNN and um Nightline uh-huh pretty regularly and read the paper and all but when uh lately like the last week or two i guess with Easter and spring break with the kids i um i hadn't been thinking much about the Middle East and what's going on over there have you been keeping up uh well uh just really the last couple of days since this uh the UN debate or whatever you want to call it that uh voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire i guess you know the thing really isn't over they uh uh-huh they had uh kind of uh i don't know if you call it stand down or whatever but anyway they stopped and wait to see if Iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though as i understand it from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the UN uh had set up you know the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all unless they're just absolutely forced to uh hum so i guess from what i understand the thing could just they could take off at any moment without uh start it you know any uh-huh you know any local um you know congressional effort or anything else because you know it's not really settled yet there's no official document signed or anything not yet not yet at all well i um when the when the crisis began last August i began to think well i i um couldn't remember things that i had studied in the past in school and all so i got out like my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history and it was really what i felt was kind of cynical because it there just hasn't been any peace over there uh-huh ever in thousands of years of history no yeah i don't know why they expect it's going to start this week you know yeah that's right and it just it's just not people they and it's not uh you know there isn't any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves uh-huh and they fight with each other and they have such hatred for Israel and yeah the uh the thing that's kind of interesting uh about this my sons in the Air Force oh yes and uh he came within about a quarter of an inch of going uh to Saudi he ended up in Korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in Lubbock hum so he ended up going to Korea but his buddies ended up going to Saudi well he's still in Korea and his buddies are home now he he almost wishes that that he could have gone home oh no he and got it over with well i just there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace yeah uh-huh and um with and that i'm afraid that we would have to stay yeah the thing uh the other thing too when this all started if you you know if you did much reading on the thing you know Kuwait the country of Kuwait was just you know somebody's uh you go back to World War i when the uh Ottoman empire broke up and the British and the French and the English yeah the British and the French mostly uh-huh decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia and part of it uh Iraq and part of it something else you know and they they split things along um uh-huh geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into uh social or cultural things at all so the country of uh of Kuwait really doesn't make just a whole lot of sense right except that it is an accepted place you know it's like any other country you know for whatever reason it's yeah it's actually there well Iraq has had uh designs on that place since nineteen twenty two so you know it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up yes and it's just that this was an excuse you know to make some noise now something that i read in the paper the other day that i thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab uh uh their version or vision or whatever the United States now is somewhat changed in that we won you know now now we are a uh a legitimate player in the game over there you know the yes we i don't think we can really understand their attitude because their culture's just so much different right uh we are now a legitimate player in the in the in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we you know we defeated you know Iran couldn't do it in seven years and we went in and did in in seven days what Iran couldn't do in seven years you know so right right that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit it makes us more legitimate so now what they're saying is that well since we won whatever we say goes because it's a kind of a might makes right attitude about it and you know we've got the power yeah yeah which is why for centuries you know hundreds of years the British and the French had so much influence in there because they'd go in and they'd win something right and then and then they could call the shots for the next you know period of time until the next strong man came up and you know and right and caused problems so well i just uh i'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go in and call the shots like you say and and i just would prefer that i mean sometimes we've said let's keep we yeah yeah we're not interested in what other countries do and then other times we jump in and do things and while i'm really glad that they uh-huh uh i it was important demilitarize demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments yeah i don't hope i'd i hope we don't try to keep uh in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to yeah stay over there because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay yeah that's that's the uh that's that's the big thing you know we still got a little bit of the old you know Vietnam um problem in you know in the back of our minds we we got this we're we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out yeah Vietnam we never did get out you know never did get the job done because they were too ham strung yeah uh this thing they they gave the guys uh the power and the material and the told them to go do it and they did it you know got in and got out i'm not sure the the big fuss that we're going to see now for the next few weeks i would think yeah and is uh you know the uh the business with the uh the Shiites of all people you know in the southern part of the country and also the Kurds because these people evidently are you know being killed off by the thousands yeah and whether the the United Nations i don't think the US will do it on their own but whether the United Nations comes around and says hey wait a minute we know this thing isn't uh all that much over we've got to go back in there and and be sure tha t this large population isn't just wiped out which is seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment uh-huh i noticed that but uh you know well i don't think there's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they oh well no no there there never will be i mean uh uh the only way that you're going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them yeah history you know until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either uh-huh no so that's that's a little rough you know we're not we're not quite up to that sort of thing no so well i guess i better go i have a repairman just came for my refrigerator oh oh well that's fun but yes well i enjoyed the topic i hope you have have a good day okay bye-bye you too bye bye  what type of lawn and garden work do you do well i do it all uh yes i i try to grow uh uh a vegetable garden and i see do you have a garden we do the same thing it's i just have a small plot it's like ten feet by five feet yeah i have two plots one's ten by ten and one's like fifteen by four it's a long skinny one and i see yeah you do a lot more area than i do i've all the rest of my yard backyard is uh you know pool and decking it's all the dirt i have left in my backyard oh i see yeah i see well i enjoy i enjoy fiddling around it's cheap entertainment right right yeah it's nice to get out in the open air and especially when the weather's not too hot or not raining or whatever but uh it is uh-huh that's right yeah i enjoy excuse me go ahead sometimes i i said i sometimes i wish i had more space you know i grow a lot of things a lot of food and uh-huh uh-huh sometimes i i want to plant something there's not enough room to plant it some of those things like uh you know the things that vine like uh cucumbers or uh that's right that's right uh-huh squash or something like that plant one of those and it takes up your whole space uh-huh takes a lot of room it sure does i made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe my goodness what a mistake that was oh yeah that yeah they they just run all over the place don't they they do well it was very good it just takes up you know like you say a lot of your garden area right right see i it's the first and only time i've done that we don't do anything exotic we just do oh tomatoes bell peppers radishes and turnips i mean not turnips carrots beets and things like that the basics uh right uh-huh yeah that's what we do too my wife used to plant a few snow peas i don't really care for snow peas well she just plants a few for herself right peas i i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago the first one they started them indoors this time i read it and so i yeah did you really oh i see okay we don't start anything indoors we just wait until you know the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground yeah i uh i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that probably so yeah you can get a head start on it but uh sure is a heck of a lot of work because you got to watch them every day and keep them watered and i i don't think i'll do it again i guess it it might would yeah um-hum yeah well it will make it will make them taste better i'm sure oh yeah yeah i enjoy it i come home from work and and i usually say hello to wife and kids and then go out and fiddle you know just walk around the yard and sure you got to inspect it yeah inspect it and the kids want to swing and i push them on swing sure sure and i walk i mow my own lawn and i do i don't have a sprinkler system i i don't enjoy watering especially yeah no i this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system and boy it is really nice it sure beats dragging hoses around oh how oh yeah you can have it come on just early in the morning and and off by the you know by the time you're up and about yeah i i usually get it started for my wife and i and she moves it around ever other day that's right uh-hum that's right it's really nice uh-huh yeah i'll have to admit i don't i do my own yard i i really don't enjoy doing that i enjoy having a nice looking yard i just don't enjoy the work that it takes to get it done uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah i had a lawn service to do my yard for me during the real hot summer months you know until i retired now i i've lost my excuse for that so i have to for the last couple of years i've done it myself uh-huh yeah sometimes i wish i could get one of these uh chemical services to come out and spray for weeds and fertilize and all that and take that one step out of the loop but um uh-huh yeah uh-huh uh-huh but uh they want too much money yeah it is kind of expensive it is of course the chemicals themselves when you buy them they're expensive too right right but it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself that's right If i have a problem discipline you know i think now boy i really need to get out you know and apply something you know and i screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something that's right right and the weed come up and all of a sudden you've got to do something else yeah that's right i'm i'm kind of bad about that i enjoyed having a lawn service but now i have the time and i really can't i really don't you know don't want to spend the money for it yeah that's true uh-huh yeah well if you enjoy it too you know you you can get out in the morning when before it gets hot and do it that's right and stuff when you only have to i'm not limited to just mowing it on Saturday morning you know i can do it on most any day of the week right when the days start getting a little longer you know you can i can start doing it in the evening after work uh-huh uh-huh that's right when they when they switch to switch when we get an hour more when they rollback an hour yeah yeah that's coming up here pretty soon is it this weekend i don't know i really don't know it just seems like i here it on the news the day before and uh i i think it's coming up here soon it's pretty soon yeah yeah uh-huh i believe it is too yeah yeah are you having any trouble with bugs in in your garden we uh not a whole lot uh i i don't use i i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust you know i don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it but then again i don't want the bugs eating it upping either uh-huh right right i i it seems like they come in spurts one year i didn't put anything on and i didn't have any problems uh-huh uh-huh next year i was planting some broccoli and and some of those they are called cabbage loppers or whatever they were just covered with them i mean i went up i didn't go out there for about three days you know because i uh-huh right uh-huh yeah uh-huh and went up there one day and the plant was nothing but a stem they devoured it that quickly that's right absolutely they really go through it they really do and they they have a you a good appetite and they would you know i i picked off like twenty of them and i go yeah you know cut worms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too boy they'll strip yeah so i got that uh what is that safer soap uh B T spray this year and i've been watching them every day and i've and i haven't seen any signs yet so if i see any signs i'm going to spray them and uh uh-huh yes uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah i did something a little bit different this year that i haven't done before i've got my garden is shaped that i can it's kind like this uh box shape so i got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box and put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure and you know various other things raised it up right well the good stuff right and i'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe i won't have oh i'll have less of a bug problem anyway at least they they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing right yeah my backyard is uh is sloping so i built a box up you know had to build the one the low side up and uh i had sandy loam hauled in i had a dump truck come and dump it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh on my driveway i guess that's what they do and then i had to wheel barrow it in but uh you know you can improve your own soil there but the Texas soil isn't the greatest gardening soil yeah right uh-huh that's right yeah you you have to work on you really do right then you know and you know if i i didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow you know uh-huh that's right when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam you know for my garden so i had i had a lot of loam out there to start with i just turned it all up and mixed it all up together with it uh-huh do you have do you have a rotor tiller small enough you have a just do it by hand yeah yeah no i don't i did it by hand uh-huh it wasn't too much of a job really like i say it's just yeah i'd like to get one of these little small ones that you see in all these gardening magazines uh-huh uh-huh It would be handy and it weighs twenty pounds or something like that my neighbor across the street has one he always uses it to dethatch his lawn i see him out there and i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it yeah yeah uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah it might be handy yeah they're pretty neat little i've never seen one i have a friend who has one and and he lets me you know no problem borrowing if it's just a hassle when you know to go up and it's a fairly large one to heave it up into the back of the van and bring it home and uh-huh oh yeah yeah uh-huh right check it back and just grab it you know if i just go to my garage and grab it uh-huh yeah that would be neat sure would we've had a garden gosh for years and years and years of some size you know i can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind that would be nice uh-huh what have you got growing right now uh got you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom and uh i've got carrots i mean yes i've got a few carrots up and i've got some radishes up and as a matter of fact i've already done a second row of radishes and uh the green onions are coming along uh-huh hm uh-huh yeah okay what kind what kind of onions do you grow do you grow those those ten fifteen Y snow excuse me yes i've for the first time we planted them this year yeah we tried to find them last year we screwed around and waited too long and i couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left but we've got some this year oh they they are the best uh-huh uh-huh uh those snow peas are up and uh my wife does uh a small herb garden on the side and uh they're up and doing fine i see yeah i uh those onions i think we we planted like twice as much this year because you know we got onions onions and they lasted from you know about when you harvest them about a month from now or so or six weeks from now until until like October and uh uh-huh uh-huh yeah we really missed them when they were gone because the ones from the grocery store just can't compare yeah yeah that's kind of a let down she made these onion rings that were so good and and and uh you don't realize how many dishes you put onions in that it's an ingredient and and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better oh i bet they were that's right we use a lot we sure do yeah one nice thing with onions and and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have you know too many right right we froze a lot of peppers we let some turn red yeah uh-huh we did that too and some we do green and then my wife puts them on pizzas and and chops them up in recipes and things like that uh-huh sure makes uh makes a colorful salad too oh yeah put them in salad yeah you're you're making me hungry here uh-huh we planted some uh yellow peppers this year we've tried it before and nope we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year oh yellow peppers huh they have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something yeah sounds like you have a real good garden yeah we enjoy fooling around with it just let me see what i got i got the peas and i've got some broccoli uh onions some some radishes and uh uh beets beets yeah we've got some beets uh-huh uh and i planted potatoes too i've never done potato we used to do it at home when i was a kid we had a huge garden oh the potato they were they're delicious but they you don't get seem to get that much for the space they they do uh-huh it takes a yeah it does take some space some beet uh potatoes and i've got some tomatoes still growing in in containers i got to wait for a place to to to free up yeah uh-huh i see uh-huh uh our our kids love pickles and we all love pickles so we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year we've got some good um um Hybrid Burpee uh uh pickler cucumbers and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own and uh-huh that will be neat yeah uh-huh uh-huh that will be neat yeah so because have you seen how much pickles cost in the store i know it i said why are they so expensive they're just a bunch of little cucumbers you know absolutely they're expensive i don't know unless it labor intensive or something i really don't know i guess but we're going to try that and see how that works an experiment i'd like to try you know just try something new every year that i haven't tried before and that will be interesting yeah sure yeah that's interesting well well i'll let you go it's  so do you have a computer at home i sure do i have an Amiga it's an O one thousand model but it's still compatible to the uh late model Amiga personal computers the three thousand and the two thousand even the five hundreds out now and i love it do you i got my i got my first one i've been at TI forever and i found an engineer selling his really old TI PC how about you you got one oh a forty four uh i think so no not ninety nine it's one of the full TI PCs ninety nine i mean or something i got you right and he's an engineer so he even came over and set it up for me and had it running for like two hundred dollars so i thought that my goodness gracious well you sure made a savings there i have never heard anything to beat that that's just terrific does does is it IBM compatible type well now it does no no no no it's just the old PC and it has two floppies it doesn't have a Winchester it doesn't have anything but for what i need just keeping records it does just fine oh i see uh-huh well if you ever decide to get a newer later model think about an Amiga because it's the slickest machine you've ever seen oh really it's got four thousand ninety six color graphics it's got real-time animation capability there's a world of games for it if you're into that but it can do word processing you can import pictures into your documents and uh it just does everything a PC can do but it does it better i'll be darn when i uh i'm in uh Plano right now but when i was up at uh McKinney i had uh IBM PS two i loved that thing i loved it uh-huh uh-huh you did well i i venture to say your you and your kids if you have any would enjoy the Amiga better well i have kids fortunately that have left grown gone thank heaven oh really well you're not supposed to admit that to them i admit it it was fun leave okay well my wife and i are gonna be glad to get ours out of the house too i know exactly how you feel the emptiness syndrome is a myth there's no such thing i mean oh really i'll tell her we're sure not staying with the PC subject subject too well are we well how how how much memory you got have you got on your machine it's nice it really is yeah we're talking though uh on my you know i don't really know i knew when i bought it but i don't know right now i've got a little program uh genealogy program called Family Ties oh yeah uh-huh and i can research and go to the library and and discover who married who what year and all this sort of thing and come back and load it all into my computer and then when i want to uh-huh say this is going to be a present for my grandchildren tell them all okay here you are and then i can sort it all that they can trace it back to their parents and the grandparents and on you know do an explosion uh-huh uh-huh and it all prints out up to five generations per child and you know you can select the child and get the whole thing i think it's just as neat as it can uh-huh well that's neat yeah i'd like to have a piece of software like that for my machine now on my machine i've got a microphone hooked up to it and i can digitize me and the wife and kids all talking and all that but i can hook a VCR up to it and take our picture oh how fantastic how fantastic and then then then if my parents had the same kind of computer which they don't they don't have a computer but if they did then they i could send them all that on a floppy disk and it would play out for them right there on the computer and they could click it to see each next scene oh but that's all possible to do on the Amiga and frankly my VCR camera cost more than my computer did get out of here for heaven's sake i've never heard of one but you can do all those sorts of things on the Amiga i didn't know anything about this that's fantastic yeah there's a lot of people don't know about it it's put out by Commodore they made the sixty four but this is a machine that they bought from a company that got started up in California i'm familiar with Commodore yeah well they make the Amiga and uh not only that but the Amiga is Unix compatible so if anybody around there is using Unix and they want a cheap Unix's work station that cost under about four to five hundred dollars then the Amiga runs Unix and uh besides uh being able to do all the other things i was telling you about well i'll be darn it's a fantastic machine if you've got to have IBM compatibility they've got a card you can plug in and you can run IBM software but the machine is so powerful i don't need it what what do you have at work uh i use a Sun work station at work but i'm i'm in the process of purchasing Amiga to use it as my desktop computer but research work though i use a Sun Sparc station so you're into computers oh we have some Suns in this building uh i'm a buyer and and i help them with their maintenance contracts and repair and things like that just it's it's not much of my job but it you know i do come in contact with them are you uh-huh those are expensive machines i know well see uh the the Sparc stations run about twelve thousand dollars in color and an Amiga runs only forty seven hundred in color good grief so it makes a real nice cheap Unix compatible desktop work station and see i've got one at home and everything i run at work i can run at home by you know same sort of stuff and uh uh it really makes it quite nice it definitely does i have four and a half megabytes on my machine here at the house and uh sixty five megabyte Seagate hard disk and it rips why do you think TI has not used the Omega because uh-huh the Amiga well because it's made by Commodore and uh most people all they know about is IBM compatible because most people in this country that know anything about computers don't know much but they do know about IBM um so when the PC came on the market and then it being first one on the market earlier than the Amiga was but when it came market people just naturally assumed that well if IBM makes it should be the computer of my choice and they intend to look around very much so as a result Macintoshes and uh Amigas didn't get a fair break oh i see where but honestly an Amiga is far and away a much better PC than the PC will ever be it has a full multitasking operating system during the Christmas holidays while my kids played games with my machines i backed up my hard disk because i used my Commodore sixty four as a terminal to it like a main frame uh-huh so i was copying files off my hard disk to floppies and they were playing a game using the uh joy sticks and they never even knew i was there except i was sitting there and i was pushing another floppy into this little slot uh while they were doing their thing to keep copying files out yeah you can't do it on any machine a Mac or anything made well that's wonderful i'd never even heard of it yeah it's kind of neat not to mention the fact that it's got four thousand ninety six colors and you can't get more than two fifty six out of a PC or a Mac either one so your kids were having a good time and you were working yeah that's right i can do that exactly you sure can you can network them together and everything it's a fantastic machine needless to say so i'm very uh high on it but you said you have computers Suns at work right what other machines do you all have at work that's marvelous just marvelous well i work in I A Smith so we're forever looking at something else uh i you know i work uh-huh i see well tell them to look at the Amiga a lot of people think it's a toy and a game machine but it is a most powerful work station all the way around multitasking and i mean a real-time multitasking operating system and computer made well you know you'd be surprised how many of the various ones are coming in and giving us demos at all times and i sit in on all this stuff uh-huh not only that but this machine can be hooked up to a regular TV set and you can do video presentations with it it has all kinds of software you can use that Commodore makes called Amiga Vision so that you can take pictures in and then you can make up your own video presentation Hewlett Packard uses it Hewlett Packards makes PC's and they use the Amiga to do video presentations and um uh campaigns educational type uh presentations for the engineers incidentally incidentally Bausch and Lomb uses it too let me ask you something uh if you were if you needed to go to another sure town somewhere you know fly to a to see a supplier and do a review there could you put your presentation on a television and just kind of send him the disk instead of going yourself uh-huh well what you would do in the case of the Amiga is you'd use NTSC output that you can get on the machine put it right out to a uh video video tape and just cut you a video tape by uh by running it uh-huh to the video tape because all the sound and graphics that it produces can be put right out of the back of the machine to a common VCR and recorded on a VHS tape so you could just say okay fellows we've got a problem get everyone in the room and let them see this tape rather than buying an airline ticket yeah if you wanted to you could uh but you could do the whole presentation and slick it up and edit it and make all kinds of changes and modification till you had it down pat on the Amiga once you had done that i mean including hooking up a camera to take pictures of things like maybe you want to do a a a a presentation on how to run some piece of gear well you want to take pictures of it you might want to take pictures of it running uh-huh because you can put more than one frame into the machine and then you can describe what's going on you can record microphoning machine then there's a way to link all that together and once you got it satisfied satisfactory done you can then take it and play it back out of the machine right out the NTSC port in the back to a VCR and record it after that you can put it all on floppy disk it might take several and between on how big a space you're talking about and uh carry it to another facility if they happen to own an Amiga well you slap it on there put it on their hard disk and away you go how much will how much would this cost for what to do it well the parts or the machines depending on what well you can get a two thousand which is uh a bare essential machine to do this with for about twenty three hundred dollars yeah for that whole operation and uh then you would uh with some add on options and things you'd have to have probably the outside price at the max would be about thirty five thirty six hundred dollars if unless you want to use a video tape to to do all kind of weird things like wipes and and fades and things like that which the uh TV people use we don't need that type we don't need that type of graphics that's just not necessary okay well if you don't need that which is really fancy and that has twenty four bit or sixteen million colors if you don't need that that's another fifteen hundred dollars and that's made by a commercial company just for the Amiga IBM and Mac both tried to get them to make it for their machines but they can't because the Amiga's the only PC on the market that has special graphics and sound and peripheral handling chips inside and that's why it can be a multitask operating system and not and handle numerous multiple jobs at once because it has three co-processor chips in there that help out the main CPU and off load from doing the graphics see the CPU in my machine is a little old sixty eight thousand and it loafs because there's three co-processors chips in my machine to handle the graphics the the color graphics one co-processor chips handles all the sounds and it can make it has four channels of sound two of them come right out the back as stereo ports i have mine hooked up to my stereo down stairs has excellent stereo dynamic range and it has a third chip in it that has all your peripherals so that if i were to copy a file from my hard disk to the floppy then the CPU just goes out and tells Paula that's the chip that does peripheral handling copy this file from the hard disk to the floppy and the CPU goes off and does something else because  well what would you have at a dinner party well uh lately since i have children i've cut down on having dinner parties but when i do i try to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time uh-huh uh i have one recipe for uh a really good um type of a meatball it's called burgundy meatballs and it's made with red red wine and um it's it's really good and you can make it ahead of time and then um make the sauce when you're ready to um to serve it that's one of my favorite things to to serve oh gosh that sounds great uh-huh well um i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or informal dinner party but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish sure oh really well i guess being from that part of the country because i mean crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish but you know i i wouldn't have to worry about satisfying my uh-huh guest but if it was a formal uh dinner party i would probably think of something else like um shrip shrimp fettucini is real easy yeah to um make and everything and it's usually well liked by people i guess i'm just a seafood fan so i think on the lines well how do you make how do you you cook crawfish i in fact i just came back from the grocery store and being in Texas we don't have too many you know people that that eat crawfish but they had live crawfish on sale oh yeah um you're not supposed to i mean you're not supposed to eat them dead i mean well you eat them dead but right because if if they're dead for too long you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out and you're not supposed to eat those because they're the bad for you um-hum don't buy them that way uh-huh okay well i'll remember that yeah so if you ever go in a restaurant and order crawfish i mean every once in a while you'll see one i mean it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident but if the tail is straight on it then yeah don't eat it but um you just put some cajun well uh-huh lots of pepper and you just boil them and they're absolutely wonderful but there's uh they're a pain to peel for some people once you get used to it they're real easy but um you know if you have nails or anything you can uh-huh plan on those being shot when you were um when when you serve it do you shell them and then serve them to i think for a dinner party i i don't know it depends like if like um-hum my age if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party no i they would shell their own you know we'd just have crawfish and beer or something but um if it was more formal like if i was you know working environment then i would probably um shell sure shell them or at least disconnect them from the head but there's a there's a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head so um so they don't have see that ooh it it would just depend that's the best part of the crawfish sucking the head but um i don't know it just it it just depended on what type it was i guess but you can buy uh the crawfish tails already peeled and everything and usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to um um-hum you know make a sauce with or something like that but you can go ahead and buy them cooked and shelled and they're more expensive of course but does it taste a lot like shrimp um yeah it really does i like shrimp better uh-huh yeah just um but crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own it also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use and stuff like that but um sure i think that and also to get totally off crawfish the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps yeah we have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks that's what i need all the time and yeah that's what i wish i had but in our family i'm the one who who cooks and i i really enjoy it it's gotten a little more difficult with kids but i really do enjoy cooking and we um we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot and before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where you know he would uh-huh oh cook and then the next time it would be my turn and i'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me and we we was really a lot of fun and i bet that that got pretty competitive you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe yeah it did and we we tried to be fancier or more courses than the other or uh it was a lot of fun you know it something unique you know and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be that would be fun ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i don't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh uh elegant theme or you know it was a lot of fun uh huh sometimes it might be the candlelight and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something well that's you know that's fun that's right it was fun and and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time uh just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying i'm uh huh that sounds right i would i'd take him up on that it does except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just to uh make sure that they didn't have to do it again make hot dogs or some potato chips or um-hum maybe i that's about how much i can cook you know i'm i'm doing a lot more cooking now then i used to but that's only because my mom just started working so she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon so i try to have things cooked for her but uh-huh oh that's nice uh um i usually try to stay out of kitchen i don't know not one of my favorite hobbies but it can it can be fun i if you have the time but you know a lot of times it's too it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it well um my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she um every Christmas and and Easter whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce and it has i don't know they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs and they are absolutely delicious i don't know what she calls them and i don't i'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol but um i don't know i would i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around yeah it's um it's in the other room i don't know if we have enough time for it it's real easy one of the unique things in this like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um oh um what ever seasoning usually just light seasonings like salt and pepper um and chopped up water chestnuts yeah oh that would be wonderful which is something different um makes them a little bit crunchy you need to chop them up real fine but um it makes them crunchy and that adds something new to it yeah and then the sauce is just made with um bouillon cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour um-hum oh so it's not a it's not a thick rich type of a sauce it's more of a when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um Chinese food um-hum the kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that they use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies and it gives it a bit of a different consistency well um how long do you cook the meatballs the meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until they're uh huh uh browned on all all sides and then drain off all the grease uh then what i usually do is i freeze them and then when you're ready to serve them oh yeah then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce and heat it probably you have to heat it up for a good oh if they're frozen you know it may take a half hour for them to thaw out but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself let them simmer in the sauce itself hum that sounds great especially i mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance i mean like if if you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend that would be great that's real good right and then freeze them sure i going to have to keep that in mind for my future because i hope to have lots of dinner parties because i like to i mean i'm yeah i'm sure that i'll be involved in a big company and i know that my future husband will be you know he's going to be working for Chevron in Houston so he's going to be um uh-huh you know i'm sure that dinner parties will come in handy yeah you'll meet friends invite invite the boss over and and the friends at work oh yeah i have to impress the boss and clients because um i'm in i'm in public relations in school so i'm going to have you know my whole job's going to be based on my clients and stuff like that so uh-huh sure i'm gonna have lots of dinner parties and have to take them out to eat and right now i am taking a class on etiquettcy and all the little bitty things that i didn't even know i mean i thought for sure i'd been raised properly but i'd been doing a lot of things wrong i didn't know about oh really but um so is there anything else well i i think we've we've covered the subject i've got some interesting information about crawfish i was in fact i was it's good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for sale oh yes you need to try them oh they're wonderful oh i will i'm sure my husband will be surprised because we were talking about them the other day even before  well what is it that you prefer to provide as far as maintenance on your vehicle i do all my own maintenance matter of fact i just finished putting a timing chain in my wife's Toyota i do i do all of that myself wow how about that that i'm not quite as mechanically inclined although that some of the the basic things that you need to do for uh the maintenance of your warranty on a vehicle oh sure sure is is stuff that you can do yourself just the oil uh changed and things of that nature that's about where i my expertise ends in in that category just you know well there's two things that drive that up here one is we is the lack of good service people um-hum because there just aren't are not any left hardly around up in this area i believe that and the other thing is the cost it's almost prohibitive to bring it to a dealer boy i tell you i just got my car back from a dealer and when it was in there i had them just go ahead and change the oil and filter thirty four dollars oh sure sure the the price is astronomical but what i do is i like to do this okay and i and i i like to play with mechanics and that's i really i've done that all my life so huh well that's uh that's quite a savings having that talent and the the little the little Toyota is a nineteen eighty three so i really don't have too much to lose if i mess it up too bad you know how many miles there is that now what did you just replace the timing chain well the camshaft timing chain now i'm not even familiar with what that where that is okay it's in the front of the engine uh say like directly behind the radiator or the water pump um-hum and it it drives from the crankshaft it drives uh a chain that drives the camshaft which is an overhead cam in those foreign cars um-hum and uh it it was getting kind of worn the car has a hundred and one thousand miles on it and it was getting a little noisy so hm not so much for the noise but if it were to jump a tooth or something of that nature i would be in serious problems on the freeway and i didn't want to chance Irene driving the car like that so sure well how much how long did it take to replace that i oh three nights i worked on it three nights and about four hours on last Saturday and i just put it in the garage and worked on it i have i have a new Oldsmobile so i really uh-huh uh it's it's it's just a little hobby and if it's not too cold outside and the weather's starting to get pretty nice so if it's not too too cold out i can go out work on it don't have heat in the garage or anything but oh sure um-hum how much would uh something like that cost in the garage uh well i figured if i had it done in the garage at the Toyota dealer i would be looking at probably three or four hundred dollars jimminy between the gasket kit and the new distributor cap i put on and the new uh chain and the labor and how much do you think the parts was by itself well the parts to to me i spent twenty two dollars on the parts oh really yeah wow so i really i really don't have heart burn at all with doing it myself over four nights tie i tied the car up if four days but we're fortunate we didn't need it oh gosh yeah four at a hundred dollars a night that's not still not too bad no i know but you know you you save the markup on the parts and of course you buy them whole sale from the parts store and and you can save a little bit there and you can save an awful lot on the labor which is high today like all the rest of us we expect top dollar for what we do and sure i don't i don't blame the garage people it's just that it's very very hard to find anybody here that's willing to do that type of work um-hum all of our so called garages are now a convenience stores that sell gasoline and they really don't do any repairs anymore so you know you're you're you're you're almost tied to the dealer to go back to them and right exactly well it seems like they're just swamped with work so well yeah well unfortunately i just had replaced the the power antenna uh you know it kind of dumb having the garage door i drove out before the door was completely up and the radio was on so it took off the antenna sure sure but the mast itself cost uh thirty four two dollars uh-huh and i went i called the dealer and they wanted two hundred and twenty to put it in sure and that's that's held in by two bolts and a bracket and a plug of wire in the bottom of it no and gosh and then i went to well it i i looked at it myself to see if i could do it myself because i you know i i feel i'm so pretty competent and handy but unfortunately unfortunately they buried this one in the sixty six Mazdas you have to remove the dash and the fuse box to get to the motor i'm sure you could of uh-huh uh-huh and so they say there's uh three hours of labor just to uncover where the the metal shaft goes in because it goes through the through the door in between the windshield and the driver's side door and comes out above the driver's head okay yeah that's one of those that sits up at an angle back there yeah okay yeah yeah yeah so it's terribly engineered well that's that's another problem you know and if you don't have all these special tools of course like i said we're very fortunate with the older cars we can work on them what um if you don't have all the special tools and the technology i i'd i would hate to buy a brand new car today with the electronics that are in them everything was visible oh yeah i imagine that would be a bear to work on you know uh anymore just putting everything on a chip is your going to have to replace the chip unless you have the tools to diagnose what's the problem with the chip sure uh-huh yes that's absolutely true uh have you done have you done much repair work yourself other other than just routine maintenance like oil changes and stuff but i had a a seventy nine Mustang uh Mazda RX7 yeah first year of the rotary engine that i used to do i used to work on because it you know heck seventy nine if i was to do something screw it up electrically uh i could i handled everything i put in antennas there you know the power antenna the replacement parts all that kind of thing sure but when it came to ever giving kind any kind of tune ups or things like that i'd take it into the shop anything basically with the yeah that rotary engine always fascinated me i was i was always enthralled by the rotary engine i think that's a neat idea and i'm surprised we haven't gone that way more and and yeah and they just stop making them now yep yep so it's kind of interesting when it's work great smooth it's a smooth running quiet car i i just i don't know why well perhaps the the retooling cost were probably prohibitive to most companies you know i suppose but i had a hundred and twenty eight thousand on it when i sold it the uh the automotive industry is in dire needs of something in this in this country and it's too bad uh the Toyota we bought i i bought second hand i did not buy it new uh yeah um-hum but if you look at what's in that little car and as opposed to what's in some of the American cars you can see where we're probably a half a step behind and i think i think we're trying to do something to correct that but i think we got away from us a little bit so yeah but i i i i just like i say to work on it myself i one i like to do that uh i i think i would do all of the maintenance i change my own oil and i change of course spark plugs and stuff like that that's routine that i i would call routine maintenance once a year i do that every fall i get ready for the winter um-hum and i even lubricate the car myself because i have a i have means of of running it up on on jack stands and and you know i have a creeper and i crawl around underneath it so it's not a big deal wow sure sure but even today like with your waste oil when you drain the oil and change the oil now i have to bring it to a disposal center i can i no longer can put it in in the trash you know or in a container yeah we have oh really we're we're really on an ecology kick up here i guess like all the rest of the country and well that's good and and they really really they come down and pound you real hard if they catch you dumping oil on the ground because it does go in and it effects the lakes and streams and it eventually winds up on the ocean here and it really makes a mess around around New England sure so we have to take the oil to uh a uh a disposal center that's an EPA you know authorized disposal center um-hum and they gladly take it but they only take it like for two hours on a Saturday morning you know and it's it gets to be a pain sometime to go through that but i think it's still worth it in the long run right because oil you can buy for eighty five cents a quart but if you buy that same oil at a dealer it's going to cost you probably two dollars a quart sure sure of course and uh and now the labor to put it in of course and uh i i again i like to do that i i would do all the maintenance on my car if i could uh um-hum you know even even into major things just to keep our car longer because i don't think we get the money that we put into them out of them in two years or three years and of course i was never in a position where i could trade my car off every two years right well it seems like you've got a very valuable talent uh well i i like i said i've done mechanics all my life and i do that with the company so uh i'm a senior engineer for them so i am mechanics and i i just uh i enjoy it i really it's like a diversion for me i i think if i had to do it oh great if i had to do automotive repair or or anything i love to do woodwork and too and it's a diversion because i know i'd really don't have to this okay so i think i like that because i know i don't have to do this but if if i were forced to do it that may be a different situation hum yeah that's true well it's been good talking to you uh it sure has i really appreciate your call and uh it's nice to talk with you folks from from down in the in the main office area and every once in a while down here at the main site yeah sure how's your weather it's pretty good oh it's been beautiful yeah we're just starting to get some nice little warm weather up here in New England it got up to seventy today that's a good sign we we we've been running around twenty in the morning and getting real cold and it's too cold to work on automobiles outside generally but we had the last few days been pretty nice there you go starting to defrost well that's great i appreciate your call and you enjoy yourself if you're ever up this way look me up in Attenborough okay sir thank you again well you too all alrighty good-bye  uh no i think that maybe the the automation people that are oh okay we're discrete well are not discrete uh electronic devices oh oh and did he is he the one that got you connected with us uh-huh um hum okay it's a lot of fun yeah you want to punch the button and go sure you ready yep okay well are you going to buy a car soon well it won't be too much longer because my husband and i are both going to retire retire and when we retire we're going to buy us a you know a new one and and get rid of the two that we have right now and what are you going to buy i do i don't know we're either gonna buy a pick up or we're gonna buy a van or we're gonna buy an economy car how do you like that well have you been listening to Iaccoca's arguments that uh that Chrysler products are the only ones that that all have airbags yeah does that make a difference to you yeah it sure does i really would like to have something like that and i'm hoping that by you know that's like right now my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now but i keep saying lets put it off lets put it off because i'm hoping they'll get so many better features yeah like what well just like that air bag i think that thing is fantastic cause i've seen some of the you know like the head on collision type things where they had it yeah and people walk away from it we had one here i guess it was about three weeks ago and the people walked away from the wreck with no scratches nothing you know a few bruises that's nice did did you see the uh i don't know if it was 20/20 last Thursday or Friday night on on seat belts um-hum did that scare you a little bit with the lady being thrown out uh-huh you got it i and run over i tell you what i would not i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door that really scared i guess i that that a little more than scared me that irritated me uh that because it if if it it surely didn't come as a surprise that that if the door came open the lady would fall out i mean and well you know what the average person would you ever have thought of that um no probably well i'm not the problem is i'm i'm really into cars and so it's not a uh i mean now it you probably would not um for me it's it's a real it's a real consideration um uh and and uh the but no i probably wouldn't have even though i'm really quite into cars it's it's probably my main hobby right because you always think i mean i don't know maybe you don't but just like me i always think well you know these things must be safe but that's just like i don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago they said you know before they had the like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist yeah all these people were and and it was on one of those kind of shows like 20/20 these people were like paralyzed and because it threw them forward but they were hooked at the waist and so it like you know did something to their spinal cord uh-huh yeah then they were like paraplegics yeah you know Road and Track had a had some articles on and particularly with with backseat uh with some where kids were were sitting in the backseat with seat belts on and they were thrown forward into the front seat and there was enough stretching the combination of stretching the spine to uh paralyze i mean to serious injury even though they were they were still locked in the the forced to go so really if your sitting in the backseat right you're better off not to have your seatbelt on if it's just a seatbelt we have a van that uh just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness yeah well tell me about your van do you like it i have an Arrow Star van we really do uh it's it's a mini van we've had it goodness in May will be five years and uh they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty and the transmission was replaced but they really are nifty um the mini van it's actually we had a station wagon before and it's a foot or two shorter than a we had a regular size station wagon um-hum and it really um we like it it the interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks huh the reason that we're thinking about something like that we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to Florida uh-huh and like i said i mean we're not that old but my husband works for the state and after a certain amount of years you can retire and when he retires i'm retiring well as soon as i get my quarters in i'm retiring period that's it you know no more and so uh-huh yeah well but the did you did you go to Florida in a van uh-huh and we wanted to travel well that was really nice traveling but you know i like to know more i mean hear about more people that have things like that you know and see what they think of them the different kinds because i've only ridden in the one that's it yeah yeah which what kind was it uh shoot i can't even think of the name of it now what what was remarkable this van even with the we have two kids and we went to Disney World uh-huh uh actually i grew up in Alabama and i went to see my mother and then went on down to Disney World and it got better than i think twenty two twenty three miles a gallon and this was with the air conditioner on and and you know yeah four people with with luggage and uh course this grant it that's you know it's been four years ago but it's remarkable that the that the bigger vans uh they're uh my boss just bought a a pick up truck and uh he only gets seventeen miles a gallon yeah but it it has a big engine and it it pulls a boat and stuff but it's and it it's got the seats that and the other thing that is interesting is it has uh rear air conditioning uh-huh and that that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates yeah well now this one that we went in it did baby what kind of van was that that we went to Florida in a what a Ford Ford what you remember he was trying to think of what the name of it was well the big you know the big vans are all real nice this was a big one i mean it was a big one it had the it had the front and the back and you know it has the uh backseat let down into a double i mean a queen size bed and then it had the two swivels in the middle and then yeah oh those are yeah yeah the two swivel chairs on the front all right and i mean it was fantastic and it got good gas mileage but they uh i don't know i don't really i don't i want something i can drive too you know and i was scared to drive that big van well well the mini the you'd be surprised if if you drive a one of the the mini vans uh fact there all more or less alike the the uh Chevrolet and uh well of course Oldsmo bile has got one and Chryslers got one but they drive remarkably like cars well do you does yours have that this one had it where you know you would see something coming in the rear view mirror i mean not the rear those little side mirror things and it would look like it was further back than it was yeah yeah but the little thing etched in it say objects are are closer than they appear or something yeah does yours do that too oh i was wondering if all vans did that yeah well you you can you can uh install those mirrors we've got the big side mirrors which are really nice i don't know if you've well if you've driven a pick up truck you know these are these uh mirrors are must be six inches across not nearly a foot high uh-huh and they really nice uh i'm on both sides actually they they fold so when you get in tight situations you can fold them back yeah well see that's the reason that we couldn't make really make them at first we were going to get a pick up truck with a camper on the back of it but then that gas mileage was just atrocious i mean it's unreal it's but there uh-huh um-hum uh you just practically don't get any well they have got some of the newer ones they you know with the aerodynamic features you can get pretty pretty decent gas mileage yeah and then uh he talked about a van and i said well you know i don't know i don't know how the gas is on most of these and another thing was that's the reason i said you know there was such a big difference you know in a little economy car but i said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along oh uh-huh when we went somewhere but really and truly the safety features but i wouldn't get one that if it had the seat belts on the door now i wouldn't get it period yeah yeah interesting enough Ford announced that i think in ninety two they're going to put uh air bags in their in their vans oh that would be good so uh and i think i i believe safety i i i i really do believe in this stuff uh and i i think it's important i'm not the air bags are a good deal but um surprisingly uh they're uh you really need to do you need a combination of both the air bags and the uh oh i think so too i don't think they should do away with the seat belts now i'm but i think you need the shoulder thing i think you need the thing around your waist but i think you need that bag to pop out too and your seatbelt so yeah yeah you know because i know so many people here that have been killed in head on collisions where maybe if they had they had that that air bag they may still be walking around yeah yeah but uh i think it's fantastic i wish they required it in everything every new car that came out i wish they would require it in it it would be interesting to see what that'd do to our insurance rates you know if if uh if the insurance companies says it says we're not going to pay you know a claim if if the car doesn't have air bags would be interesting wouldn't it uh that wouldn't be fair but uh yeah well no because what they would do is that's what they're going to plan on you know they would have to do it the insurance company would have to do the same thing they're given like a ten year time limit yeah where okay these cars i guess they figure all the old cars will be off the roads or something by the in ten years yeah and then you know if you didn't have a car that had one in it then your insurance would go up enormously uh i've got to go my son's in a performance tonight i have to leave in a couple of minutes uh i think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time oh that's okay okay it was good talking to you okay good night well you you too all right bye bye  okay well i just got back from taking my little girl to her Brownie meeting and then we had this whole can uh a bag filled full of cans and they've been recycling at their school well she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow uh-huh um-hum but they were filled with beer cans and i hated to take a big old sack i mean we're talking you know like a lawn bag full of them like i no we'll just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway uh-huh they get tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or cans and i think that's all oh oh okay and they're taking the money that they earn to plant trees oh that's a good idea yeah and they've got those bins that just stay there and they decorated them real cute you know with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff uh-huh so they're getting into it i don't know what they get for the tickets though what do you get for the tickets if you bring stuff oh the class i guess gets the most tickets gets uh gets a party oh so that's not bad yeah that'd be good um i know we i already have them thanks um we're we are kind of getting into recycling now i'm in college and i live in a dorm and we recycle paper um-hum and i know there's a glass plant up here and they recycle glass and you know we recycle aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff so in each of the dorms you have a place for that uh-huh ah that's really good um-hum yeah and then when our dorm we whenever our bins are all filled up we take them and turn them in and then we get money for that so hm for the dorm and who decides what you do with it yeah we just put you know we just keep it with the dorm and what do they do with it well we buy things for the dorm whatever the dorm needs you know like we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things and then we buy like cooking equipment and stuff uh-huh or we play games like board games we buy board games you know it's just different things whatever you know would we vote on it and whatever the dorm would want that's what we buy well i graduated from college in nineteen seventy two um-hum and we were just um not aware that this was a problem that we ever would need to recycle anything of course you just threw it away yeah uh-huh so a little different and i wanted to do this thing that you can get through Target to recycle i had my school do it um-hum but my principal said since we're doing this thing called Operation Desert Shield we're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all this um-hum yeah for the whole school you know it was just this big project she didn't want to get into that and i could do it in the center and i just never got around to it um-hum but it's like a club you know about that um-hum there was a little boy that had died of leukemia i think and he was had started this um save the environment club oh and his mother is carrying this on and you can get the information to set it up you know or join you don't have to join it as a group or anything i don't guess but you could start your own anyway get a a pamphlet uh-huh oh that'd be good um-hum um is that what this target is what you're um-hum do y'all have Target stores up there no no huh-uh that's a department store oh kind of like K Mart except it's a little better than what K Mart sells i think uh-huh uh-huh oh oh i was like what's Target what's Target no um i know there's i don't really know any other recycling that they do we so you're not picking you're not having it picked up at your houses or anything yet no we no huh-uh we have to take it to a a recycling place huh now in some of the towns around us they're already picking up the newspapers um-hum well they're doing that here too now that i think about it once every so many weeks and you have to pull out all the slicks and you have to wrap them up with string oh and i think that's all they're picking up but you know like in Minnesota they've got those bins where you put your plastics and your bottles oh i didn't know that yeah because well my brother-in-law lives in Minnesota and they're just nice plastic bins and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash and they pick them up um oh i never heard of that so do y'all have can banks um not that i know of no no it's just a big old bin and you just feed your cans slowly in through slot and your money comes out you know every once in a while for however much poundage you've got and you keep feeding it till the light goes off oh my gosh and you get instant cash but they had one that i was putting my stuff in and i went to take some today and it was gone i don't know but i i located another one today on the way to work hm yeah uh we have places where we go and we what we do is we unload our cans it's like a conveyor belt and the belt um separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because of it has a magnet on it and then they weigh all your aluminum cans and then you get money for your aluminum cans but they don't give you for the other no but now they're going to start giving us money for the other ones too well that before they didn't but i know they're going to start now uh-huh well they're certain places you know where i know you can take your leaded cans but i don't know where they are they publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it um-hum i don't know i'm trying but i just can't recycle everything just not that dedicated yeah yeah uh-huh yeah but well that's all i really know about recycling me too if they would oh i know we're saving our grocery bags now oh really yeah they're t aking those up you can take them to the stores um like Kroger's doing it and i think Skaggs do you have those up there we have Kroger but not a Skaggs and we they're taking our milk cartons and our plastic Coke bottles there too oh so huh that's pretty good isn't it you guys are getting into it more than we are it sounds like it you'd think you would be um-hum huh-uh i've never seen any you know places that do i know um you we reuse our grocery bags now we take them back you you know and use the ones that we have you can like if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones you mean where you sack your own groceries yeah yeah but we don't have any place that collects the grocery bags huh and i don't want to go with those canvas bags right now i'm sorry i'm not that European yeah but you know they do that like i went to Europe uh nineteen seventy three um-hum and every you know they go all the time i mean it's like they would go almost everyday to the store and they had their little bags way back then and fill it up and they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators um-hum oh my that's why i mean they couldn't put anything in it hardly but hum well what are you going to be when you get out of college i'm a finance major well that's why i started what i did i think i went into teaching oh here in Texas it's a real mess right now oh really oh definitely there's no what let's see we've had the funding we've run out of money we've frozen the money right and they had until the fifteenth of April to come up some formula that would be more equitable to districts different districts according to finances because the poor districts were getting less money so not as good an education right um-hum and now they're trying to take some money away from the richer districts like the one that i'm in in Dallas and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable and if they can't come up with something by the fifteenth then the state's supposed to decide the courts what do you think the outcome will be i think they're gonna uh maybe give us a state income tax do you have one yeah we're not looking forward to it but something's got to be done yeah oh yeah we've had one as long as i can remember i mean well it's going to hit us yeah and i don't know it didn't doesn't seem like it would work to take it away when we're using it but maybe i know we're not using it so wisely um-hum we have too many administrators yeah in some of these big districts but other than that well can you think of anything else we need to talk about um-hum um i can't think of anything on recycling me either anything else no what about people from uh Pennsylvania what do they think about Texans what do we think about them um-hum oh i don't no i never really thought about it i have no clue what you guys think about Pennsylvanians have you thought about that um probably a lot more civilized more um refined than a lot of the people would be down here oh really i would hope so i mean you've been together a little bit longer than we have there's some i i don't know i really don't know anyone from Texas or anything no i've never been there hum-um well i've never let's see i think i have too been to Pennsylvania Gettysburg yeah yeah we went up there now that i think about it on one of our long trips we take off on uh-huh oh well she'd be big i don't know what are you saying Holly oh my little girl is in the second grade and told me to tell you that shboom means good-bye in the Israeli language oh Israel is what you say it is Holly Israel in Israel see she's got this little girl from Israel in her classroom that she's befriended oh so she's into this oh well is it like a foreign exchange type student huh-uh you know we've had a lot of the Jewish uh people  well ironically enough i'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because i resumed an aerobics class the night before last oh no i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle awe yeah so exercise is not supposed to do that to you that's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way you know down the hallway uh-huh do you do anything on a regular basis well i i off and on off and on right now i've been off off but um i've been going over to the fitness center yeah that's a good yeah i my husband's a TIer in the house unit here yeah three times yeah three uh-huh well i try to go over there at least three times a week and i try to walk um at least five times a week do you when you go to the Texans i have to ask you and if this is getting to we're not supposed to get too particular but i'm just curious uh-huh when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek in terms of there's so much it's so much of a weight orientation weight lifting et cetera yeah uh well i've been going to Spring Creek i haven't been to the Dallas one now in oh a couple of years yeah well at least since they've redone it supposedly redone uh-huh yeah it's well it's not that great and i go to the Spring Creek one on and off but my husband's working over there and he just goes to the Dallas one but i just don't i mean it's just so much weight lifting even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it so i don't really know what yeah yeah that's true or is that what your into or no no well i've i've used the Nautilus equipment and the bikes and stair climbers and stuff like that mostly i don't use the free weights but uh-huh yeah i like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there yeah i like those too and the pool yeah that's great and the pool when it gets warmer yeah i know well what i did was i went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas and long story short i hadn't this is really a stupid thing that happened but they have like the gymnasium flooring and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where i usually stand uh-huh in any class like that i go to instead of having that level you know uh-huh they had a chrome strip that wasn't level and it was about four inches deep and then about oh a seventy degree angle oh my goodness and as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it um the orthopedist called it a uh basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you and it snapped uh-huh woo i know we went to uh HDA well whatever in Plano and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show and the doctor said you didn't do anything there's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you that was Tuesday night and Wednesday night the radiologist called me at work and uh i was on crutches and he said i think you better call an orthopedist uh-huh uh-huh um so we went to one and he just put a big old cast on it put a big cast on it yeah for about four weeks four weeks yeah so i mean i like aerobics but i'm not so sure well not that much though no i've never i was off for about six months too just for some other surgery i'd had but i've never i'd you know i was pretty much in shape walking and and you know this is one of those things like this orthopedist said he said you'd be surprised how many basketball how many people come in here with things like that because they are active yeah you know i was real embarrassed but i felt kind of stupid well those things happen though yeah they do i mean i guess i'm glad you know that um nobody really noticed i guess you could say yeah because i got up and started jumping on it again well that did a lot of good i'm sure yeah really so i enjoy aerobics and i do it because i like it i mean i like the music and yeah that kind of stuff i like the music but i've been unable to do that because i hurt my foot about five years ago i broke my heel oh and uh so that makes my foot how'd you do that in aerobics no no actually i was up on a ladder and uh fell off leaned the wrong way oh goodness uh-huh and when i came down i hit with my full weight on my foot but on concrete what'd they do for that did they have to cast it and yeah they had well they had to go in and do surgery they put a pin in it oh so the aerobics the impact would not be good yeah yeah that cause i permanently damaged the the uh cushion under my heel you know the normal cushion that you have there so oh goodness uh-huh i can't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt oh that makes sense so i mean are you in terms of other things like like like not running but playing a little bit of tennis or can you not do stuff like that at all uh well i haven't tried that i don't know it's been i bet it's it's been thirty years since i played tennis yeah it's been but um mostly into just walking and stuff like that that's probably the safer way because i notice in aerobics um lot of the women that that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things uh-huh i'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coronary coronary yeah and there was my ego when i went ahead and i went oh i can do that and uh-huh half the time though i don't um jump half as much as i mean i'm like i'm real tall and you know i'm i'm not heavy but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height um i'm five eleven uh-hum uh-hum oh you know you just take it easy um but when i see some women i mean some and i just don't think it's healthy all that pounding all the time sure it isn't really it's not really good for your knees so yeah that's the other reason and uh-hum i don't know this was just i guess something freak that happened to me because i wasn't familiar with the um well the floor was uneven you know oh it was completely i mean it literally the two dissimilar floor level floor coverings were not level and at first after it happened i thought maybe that's a handicap access and then i said no that's just the way it's constructed sure yeah yeah and my husband being a TI engineer i said i said a few things to him when i got home i said who has engineered that real ly but i uh sounds like you like one thing that i like like swimming you like that a lot uh-huh yeah i like swimming uh-huh do you like that what'd that voice say do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to uh no i like i like it because i i want to it makes me feel better that's how i am yeah yeah if i don't do it i just feel like i don't have as much energy uh-huh i mean it's real funny because if you you know it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you'd be tired but it's the other way around right it curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff uh-huh yeah really yeah and i need all the help i can get yeah but that gravity factor i know uh-hum uh-huh it does get you like that orthopedist said to me he said don't worry Diane he says he said uh you're at thirty something but you're on the upper side he said that uh don't worry he says even if you weren't doing anything your body would start that would start to happen to you but thanks a lot yeah because i was saying to him i said i'm not that heavy i'm not heavy you know maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being uh-huh i said uh why do i feel like i need to start pushing myself more and he goes human nature no and then you know you see these little girls in these little bitty things and they're all like twenty one years of age uh-huh uh-hum but luckily at Texans there's a little more diverse diverse clientele that's true they do except for the guys that lift the weights they do intimidate they do yeah i try try to go real late or real early before they get there there's yeah there some things i'd like to try but you know sometime when i ask i just feel like boy am i stupid or what uh-huh that's one thing i like about the Spring Creek place at least the fellow that's there one of the fellows that's there at night and on weekends is real helpful uh-huh and his name is B J and i don't think i've ever i think i've that there was some girl there i've been there like maybe a dozen times but i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to uh-huh uh-huh it's terrible it's i don't know if the Dallas location it just seems that um sometimes i feel like i'm in a singles bar yeah yeah that's true yeah i and i haven't haven't noticed that up at Spring Creek no i haven't either and i just uh it's not that far of a drive and i'm glad they did that um you're not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site it's not at all anything worth talking about yeah i thought maybe one of these days i'll drive over there and check it out but yeah but if you don't live near there that's not worth yeah i live in Richardson but it's about half way between the Spring Creek and the the Dallas site so we yeah that's that's actually where this happened to me out in i say Plano but it's all the same to me Richardson over on Campbell and Park Hill there's a uh new recreation center uh-huh uh-huh and uh as we were doing it too everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities to play basketball waiting around for us and as we walked out i was limping and i'm like oh great i have purple tights on you know uh-huh and they're going yes but in general i like to exercise i i like dance a lot so i mean i aerobics is something i'd hate to give up but uh-huh uh-huh he he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot but he just said to me maybe you ought to try bicycling or yeah probably will for a while because it it's going to be real tender when they he told me eight to twelve weeks not anything you know i said but you're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks he said yeah but uh-huh that's just they tried to put me in some kind of um immobilized walker because he doesn't like to put casts on when it's warm but i just the more they tried to get my foot in the more i screamed i couldn't you know yeah i know what you mean adjust that well you you know more about this stuff than i do obviously then not fun no well you're walking okay now obviously and you can oh yeah i have a slight limp from it but it matches one if i have one on the other side yeah yeah you know so you're still able to walk yeah well is there anything else about exercise we can talk about well other than i need to go you know more yeah me too me too i need to go actually get something to eat here i need go more but it's great though i really do enjoy it okay thank you Sandy sure thanks then uh-huh bye-bye bye-bye  okay so what kind of movies have you seen lately i guess um a lot well the last movie i saw but it wasn't my choice was the Ninja Turtle movie obviously you have kids that's right yeah but my preference is the one we saw before that was Silence of the Lambs i haven't seen that one yet that's an excellent movie um the last movie i saw was uh Sleeping With The Enemy and i uh see i'm not a big Julie Roberts fan but i was a lot oh was that good i heard oh okay i was i was a lot more impressed with her than i though i would be it turned out to be a better thriller than i was expecting it to be so yeah it was a pretty good movie well that's good yeah Silence of the Lambs kept me on the edge of my seat i i'm ready to go it just it's you know hasn't worked out that way yet you know it's uh it looks good you know right yeah it is right and i do if you like thrillers anyway in fact people i've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards so so oh really oh i love them like that i'm not i mean i i like all ranges of movies but yeah uh-huh i like that where they run tense i really enjoy they keep me guessing the whole time it's really it was really interesting uh-huh uh-huh well what other movies have you seen then lately oh other than the i assume you were talking about the new Ninja Turtles movie yes the new one of course is that any good i mean i'm sure i'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives and she's got two boys that i took to see the first one so i'm sure i'm going to see the next one here real soon oh it really was i didn't see it the first one my husband said it was um about the same lines oh well then it won't be too bad you know it wasn't impressive necessarily but it was better than it could have been so yes right right and um i was impressed with the fact that um it wasn't that childish you know what i mean it wasn't my daughter's five i mean she understood everything she goes to almost all movies with us except you know R rated and uh yeah she really enjoyed it but it was on a higher level you know where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did and i liked that right right yeah i think that's important if you're going you know if you're going uh kids are going to uh parents are going to have to go you ought to make it at least semi you know right that's right that's right it's pretty good but we take her to just about semi for them too so yeah every movie and she uh she does really good we've taken her from real young and she does real good like i said we don't take her to R's so if and when we ever get a babysitter like we did with Silence of the Lambs we go see it uh-huh uh-huh i was about to say you're not going to take her to that one i'm sure do you take her or do you go to a lot of comedy movies or to oh no no yeah yeah um what was the last comedy you saw oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw huh huh huh good question good question we don't get to go that often but i'm something on the tip of my tongue and i can't think of which one it was um noise gosh i can't remember i the last uh in fact i guess this was the last movie i saw i said that wrong the last movie i saw was The Hard Way with Michael J Fox well that really wasn't too bad it uh-huh but that that sounds good there were you know he's supposed you know he's this actor right and he's he's playing a a cop well he's he's he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the the stuff i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop uh-huh right oh okay you know i mean there there were times when he was like he'd be running with a gun or whatever he didn't look like a cop when he did it and i was so impressed with that because uh-huh that's neat cause that the part was hard to do that you know you oh yeah because i mean everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to you know to imitate them or whatever and uh i thought he did such an excellent job of not right yeah going that far now by the end he was looking more like a cop but at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part you know he was trying to trying to get it but he wasn't there yet but you could tell right yeah right like i said i thought was a real good acting and writing job both you know because i think or directing job i think they did a real good job of that and um James Woods i think is who it was did an excellent job as the cop i mean you know he just yeah uh-huh yeah i like him yeah and there were there were some definite um should i say tense moments with him in there so probably the last comedy we saw now that i think about it is Home Alone yes i i i had seen it before Christmas but i took a date to it uh about a month ago so i i i've seen it the second time not too long ago so yeah uh-huh it was really cute i really enjoyed it of course the bad thing about it was uh uh the the second time i saw it i didn't really enjoy it as much and i was kind of surprised at that i thought that would be one of those that i would love to watch over and over but before maybe it's just the idea of my reaction the first time i laughed so hard i was hoarse yeah uh-huh uh-huh i really was i was hoarse getting out of there and maybe i just laughed so hard the first time that i didn't have it i mean it just wasn't as funny the second time because i had just gone overboard the first time i don't know but yeah right yeah maybe so maybe so yeah i mean it was it was a great movie though i loved the movie yeah i did too i'm looking forward to this summer uh Naked Gun Two and a Half is coming out i love those movies i do too i mean they are just slapstick it you have to see those twice to catch everything oh yeah well you have to see them more than that i i i still catch things in Airplane that i didn't catch yeah yeah those yeah i do too i its amazing i love those movies i really do so i'm looking forward to seeing that because that looks hilarious as they all do well we we try to go yeah oh yeah a couple of times a month i guess to see a movie it it's just getting so expensive uh-huh oh isn't it though you know but that's at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper that's exactly what i was going to say i keep not doing it until after i'm there and then all of a sudden i'm saying i wish i'd bought these things right but normally we don't think about it until right i know because we can go spend fifteen dollars just getting in the three of us yeah easily yeah yeah and then if you want popcorn and stuff it's just i mean uh it's incredible i don't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both you know popcorn is not that expensive so they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and Coke no no it's nowhere near that expensive and it it's just the idea that these uh these actors you know live in such lavish style i mean it's as simple as that yeah we just keep breeding them yeah and as long as we keep paying the money for it they are going to keep paying them you know yes oh yeah oh that was that was an excellent movie i guess so now have you seen Dances With Wolves did you love it i haven't seen we're waiting for the video no don't don't that needs the big screen it really and truly does because to get the feeling no really oh uh-huh of like when the buffaloes are when they're chasing the buffaloes and everything you've got to be where you feel it you really truly do i would i mean uh-huh oh really oh i would i mean i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video too but i'm glad i didn't i really and truly am i mean that movie that was one movie i came out impressed really uh-huh i really and truly did i mean i have absolutely no problems with them winning seven Oscars none at all normally i'm one of these people that i don't like one one movie taking all the honors i wanted him to win best that's good i heard that yeah yeah best actor on top of it like i said i wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one but even though they were okay the girl in it yeah oh yeah uh they uh somebody made an interesting observation now that i think back on it i'd say yeah i can't believe that either she was the only indian to have her hair done at all times you know what i mean you know oh gosh yeah yeah it was just too perfect at all times that was a mistake that they made they shouldn't have done it now the best the supporting actor he was good yeah but from what i heard the guy who got it was better so i you know i can see that but oh yeah do you think my daughter would like it oh well there are there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side but um it's it's or just oh okay she doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes okay no problems it it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide the hides so there's you know there's see that's the one that is the honest to God the one reason i don't want to see the movie is because i love buffaloes for some weird reason and i know they're fake yeah but well and and of course and well yeah that and plus i mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt so i mean they are killing buffaloes in it but they don't stress that very much they really don't and i think it's an excellent movie for if if she enjoys okay okay movies i think it'll work pretty good yeah oh that'll be good we really need some my husband keeps wanting to yeah and i heard the video's even going to be longer they did a lot of stuff that they cut out it's it's it's a long movie oh yeah i may have to see the video i hadn't even thought of that yeah that's true they said yeah they said there's a lot that had been edited because of the length uh-huh uh-huh and that they wanted in so they're going to put it in the video and that way you can watch it at your leisure yeah well yeah i kind of like it when they do that because the video like i said there are certain things you can't do with a video and the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea yeah that's true yeah yeah because i mean when you rent a video videos of course are not cheaper either and um and so the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea because they they make bundles of money off those things true yeah i know it isn't that ridiculous we have cable which helps a lot oh i do too yeah but not enough yeah i'm getting to the point where you know i watch well i watch Nick at Nite yeah we keep holding out you know  well i haven't had too much of a chance to watch TV lately so probably everything i'm going to say is kind of dated yeah well i can understand that it's it's that time of the year uh we just uh my wife and i just recently moved into our house so we're yeah oh spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but um i like to keep up to date too um i guess yeah yeah uh-huh in the since i got out of college which was about five years ago i've my TV viewing started to tend more towards uh documentary news programs things like that something that's going to keep me up to date i've kind of kind of gotten away from uh being a series watcher having to keep up to date with uh um-hum um-hum oh yeah i think when you're in college you kind of you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week um-hum yeah that makes a big difference so so yeah i i used to when my kids were real little and i was home i watched uh i was home more i watched things on a more regular basis but right now the last thing i watched regularly was Thirty Something when it first came out did y'all ever watch that okay yeah i yeah started too and uh kind of kind of worked away from that yeah yeah i i have a hard time sticking with something like on on on on TV because it like it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or two you feel kind of left out but um yeah yeah yeah right right i know but i'll tell you what um we're really strict with our kids about television and one night a couple of weeks ago um-hum it was just a just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch and we said okay well we'll sit down and we'll you know look at what you want to see let's just turn it on and see what's on we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it i believe that and so we you know and it was prime time it was what seven thirty eight o'clock on a week night and no we have cable and there wasn't anything on any channel and and the stuff that was on the prime the networks you know ABC NBC CBS um-hum um-hum was it was just um dribble yeah do you know i mean it wasn't even funny it wasn't creative it it was the worst i've seen i mean i have not watched prime time week night TV i guess in a real long time because i was shocked that's right yeah well i i know exactly how you feel you know what i'm saying that's right i i uh when i first moved down here uh moved into the apartment and got cable and uh i guess i sort of kind of became numb numb uh nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the TV you know and then all of a sudden i started paying paying attention to um um-hum to network TV again once in a while right now we don't have cable and it's surprising how much it's changed the you know the the whole moral situation everything is just just gone one whole complete direction different right right um-hum yeah and uh we we don't have any kids yet but i i feel the same way it's really tough to find something um-hum um-hum that's that's uh that's going to be good and interesting for the kids even even cartoons um you you know you you watch uh you watch some of the cartoons and right right oh yeah kids kids aren't even going to understand half the humor that's in there it none of it's probably damaging lot of times but uh right right it's just it's just uh like a necessary evil i mean when we when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we we just had Sesame Street and that was about it you know right right but now in order to seem you know humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff but it's just one of those things you know you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if you're oh yes yeah that's right if you're in the room so but it's such a shame because it could be so good i i don't understand why first of all why the public puts up with it and second of all why the networks think that that's right well that's true you know we enjoy that kind of stuff i can't it's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that that can't be the problem it must be the marketing pressures and uh-huh you know their demographic studies that they do that show you know that everybody's IQ has dropped dramatically or something that's i'm glad you said it and i didn't have to but that that that's the i feel the exact same way i sit i sit and watch some shows and uh and i'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show you know why do you do this to yourself i know why do you do this yeah i know i'm trying to think if there's anything i do you like uh i like stuff that's on Great Performances and i we used to watch mystery quite quite a bit and enjoyed that okay yeah stuff i guess that's mostly public on public TV as a matter of fact you know when i was a kid excuse me my parents used to have we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular TV that we watched we had to watch an hour of public TV right now there's an idea that was just the rule and if they saw us watching something they'd say all right what did you see on What's New or there was some other the children's program i think at the time was called What's New so we had to give a little oral report before we could um okay yeah watch our program but do you watch do you watch sports on TV are you a sports fan yeah yeah that's that's pretty good i can't handle it very long i i mean i'm i'm a sports fan but it's yeah yeah uh-huh well it's kind of it's kind of like reading magazines any more If half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials it probably wouldn't be so bad but uh it it's you're missing an awful lot i'd rather personally rather watch um-hum right yeah yeah see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium but uh but uh no i don't sit down i'll sit down for the big games the Super Bowl and the championship yeah that's true the traffic um yeah yeah you know things like that But i don't follow any team i check the scores the next morning and i know how everybody's doing and that suffices me But um-hum um-hum yeah yeah i like i like good comedy good humor once in a while yeah i i enjoy that but what do you where do you well oh do you get the comedy you don't have cable now i was going to say they have a comedy channel now but again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly uh commercials and then you're no we don't yeah yeah you know trying to pass the time to wait till the next comedian comes up you know what i did there was a time there where i could um tape things and then i'd fast forward through the commercials saved a lot of time that way right uh-huh yeah it works you bet yeah but that takes too much planning yeah no i don't know if there's any any series that i pay attention to i try to watch Cheers once in a while um now that yeah is that still real good it used to be real good is it yeah it is in fact it's i think it's on tonight i just got in from outside so i so i'm kind of oh oh okay out of it Things like that and i consider that fairly intelligent humor you know yeah yeah yeah you can tell they pick up the words every once in a while right right right isn't it such such a long running yeah program yeah they do have a good they do have good writers for that oh that makes me think do you watch Saturday Night Live at all i try to yeah we try to stay up too yeah if it's getting harder and harder ten years ago wasn't so hard to stay up to watch it well yeah you know and and it was it was just automatic too no matter where you were you stopped and and sat down and watched it i think it's come around again it's gone through cycles but uh yeah right yeah yeah it was it we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there but we started watching again uh-huh but it's a real different show than it was when it started it's it's funny now and it's better but it's real different than what it used to be but you can't be uh so um you can't be outrageous yeah that's right that's right right you know if you keep that same format there's only so long that you can be outrageous so that's for sure that is for sure so well i guess there's a few things around still but uh yeah you have to hunt hard for them i guess yeah sounds like we pretty much agree yeah i guess so well well its been uh good talking to you yeah good talking to you okay take care bye you too bye  are are you a uh a TIer uh no no i work there as a temporary oh really but are you at TI oh yeah so you have to do the random drug testing oh yeah yeah in in in fact with me uh this is uh it's not much to talk about i i'm so much for it i don't really have much to comment about it uh there's been some interesting subjects that they've called how many times have you called or have you been participating in this uh oh about ten ten or eleven calls oh you got ten well you you've passed me up this is about six times yeah uh um as contract person we have to do random drug testing too so yeah it doesn't bother me i don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything no i think it's good in fact uh i don't know what the statistics were but i think that they were very surprised to find it so low i think they were expecting it to find uh like the national average at TI and i think it was tremendously down i think as far as the number of drug users you mean or people huh yeah as as far as the number of people that they actually found that were drug users but i think that uh i was well you had when i was at TI of course we had all the information before they started right and they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rela rehabilitation programs and i think that's what helps you know that that you know warning when you have a drug program uh you know the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs actually go and then uh usually a lot of them uh partake in uh some of the benefits of of rehabilitation and everything so right yeah so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee yeah our our numbers have been way down i don't know what they were oh when i worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person and so we had when we sent temporaries to TI we had to have them drug tested and we did have a couple of cases where we really yeah the person said that they hadn't used anything and their test came back positive and normally we didn't retest them but there were a couple people that we really thought that they were telling the truth and we retested them like the next day and they came back negative oh really the second time so that that's the only thing i think that might be a little bit of a problem oh yeah you're that's a good point but at TI they before they had the testing i've forgotten it seems seems like it's a year ago September something like that they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government and and that of course that's critical just as the point that you're brought up that whoever does your testing has got to be you know have a lot of quality control that they keep track of everything they don't make mistakes that would be terribly embarrassing right for someone to really come back positive and they were not and i haven't heard of any now i'm not in personnel or anything yeah but uh they say that there it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and and they're not you know in other words there's very few mistakes and that of course has got to be critical it's got to be if you have a drug testing program it's got to be with a very very good agency you don't just have you know some local uh group do it it's got to be a a a highly qualified agency right yeah not just some doctor's office somewhere no you don't want to do that it's got to be you know a laboratory that do quality control and and double check and i think that TI has has latched themselves up with an established group and and that would be true for any company that does it and and not to have a just a very casual thing it's got to be with a you know first class totally independent agency not local of course ours i think well i think it was in in the south somewhere but it wasn't even in Dallas you know the one that did us yeah oh really huh do you do they um have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive or do they fire them right away or oh no no they're not fired they there are they have one chance to then go in a program if you come back positive you have one chance to go in and go into they have a lot of uh rehabilitation both for alcohol and for drug use uh and they have uh a lot of uh they they have an agency where you can go for personal problems financial or whatever right and so they they they they don't no it's not firing first it's uh definitely try to encourage people to rehabilitate in fact they again before you go you know that's that's why i said when they first started it they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and if you may have taken drugs go ahead and and get rehabilitated first and and and they won't even say anything about it you know oh sure right i think that's really good i know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something oh sure oh yeah no that that's not right it's really uh an illness or whatever you want to say that it is you know it's a weakness and all and who who all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another and i think that uh those people that have that and and however they got into it i have children i always worry about the the classical thing that you see on TV where the drug uh pushers give it to the kids for free you know and get them sucked in and then they sell it to them you know the classical thing is to give it away or i always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party and they slip it to them i i don't know i don't even have that much knowledge to know right whether that would uh get them addicted or not you know that that's a real worry yeah some of the stories you read about cocaine that's like people try it one time and they're addicted my husband is a counselor and he works with mostly with adolescents oh you know a lot about it then yeah so yeah i hear a lot of horror stories about things like that but most of the time it's no they get into a wrong crowd first and then they start a drug problem yeah it's usually not a one time accidental thing i don't think yeah i know i i'm glad of that and i have uh knock wood had uh pretty good luck with or very good luck with my daughters so far i know that they're not on it that's my phone i i i have one daughter still at home one's at UT and one's at home gets dozens of calls a night yeah oh uh no no no no no i i i don't care about that that that she she'll be on the phone all night yeah well i'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that um yeah uh it seems just if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that's best way to avoid trouble from what i can gather right do you have children no not yet we're expecting a baby in July so we're starting from yeah oh great oh fantastic fantastic experience i've got two as i said i've got one in at UT now in Austin and one at home and uh i always say that i've learned so much more from them than i than ever taught them yeah yeah it's a uh fantastic experience you can't oh we're really excited about it oh yeah you you know one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing like on a Saturday morning if they've been out at a party Friday night and yeah you're not too sure what's going on he tells parents all the time haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked the the key thing that i think uh we try to do is that bring all the friends over here have our house as a place where they can come at any time so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome and they're always over in someone else's house so our we've been lucky that uh our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know and right uh-huh yeah i think that's a really good thing to encourage and then you can kind of keep an eye and you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want but at least you see what's going on and uh you always have your house welcome then then your children'll think that uh you know you're cool parents and all that you know right well well good luck with your your expected uh baby there uh my wife was yelling in my ear was talking in my ear she said uh reminded me to say that uh they're very cheap until they get get to start dri ving oh well thanks uh-huh and we have one of course i say in college driving and and one going to drive this summer so uh kids are cost you practically nothing because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything but you wait until they go and get a car insurance and you and that's when they get expensive as they get older you know uh it it yeah yeah they they cost you practically nothing from one to five and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons but uh it's well worth it and everything gets worse yeah uh yeah i think it'll be neat be great it's a great experience really you still there okay i thought that was cut off there but yeah yeah yep i'm still here well good you know i don't have much to say about drug testing uh well i can't think of no i can't think of anything else to say about that either so you you've done this ten times yeah okay did you get did you get the booklet on as to get the gifts and all that uh no i i don't work for TI so i get cash oh okay well i i didn't know what they're they were going to do they sent us a little booklet i just got it a week or so ago saying you know so many calls will be something a prize and everything right yeah there's yeah well that's great well what kind of cash i've forgotten what were they going to do hum was it five dollars a call or something well hope i hope they follow through and everything yeah five dollars a call yeah well technically we're not supposed to talk about the phone calls while we're on them so i guess we better get off right yeah well right it was good talking to you bye right bye-bye now  exercise tends to be a a topic that i guess i've never developed any will power to maintain any regular program i uh oh i guess all the factors that drive one to do that are appearance or general health or some some need for reduction of weight or whatever right and i haven't uh been cursed or blessed with either depending on the way you look at it um i've always been a physique that can stay skinny no matter what i eat or how much i eat or if i uh exercise or not and they tell me that's going to catch up with me someday uh yeah uh well they say your metabolism slows with uh six percent with every ten years of your life or something like that well maybe that'll allow me to outweigh some of the things i have to pick up on occasion when uh i got married i was working a summer in college in construction and lost lot of what little weight i had yeah i got married at a hundred and thirty pounds and twenty years old and i was just this little toothpick up there had to buy a new suit for it just to fit in there whoa yeah and it took me a good ten years to put on some weight and any exercise even when summer would come and i'd mow the lawn i'd lose five to seven pounds just just as soon as the heat kicked in yeah and finally at around age thirty i i managed to keep some weight and not lose so much during the summer and i hover at a hundred fifty and i'm six one so yeah wow it's not too bad it it it's unfortunate though i guess because i probably should uh do a little less of the hardening of the arteries with the salt and a little less of the sugar here and there but yeah yeah well to give it give you some perspective my brother's six two and weighs about two hundred and fifty pounds yeah a lot a lot of people uh my brother in laws are all everybody is bigger than me for the most part but uh it's kind of nice i've noticed a little bit of love handles here and there and my face has filled out a little bit from the pictures but uh yeah yeah all that is is ever so slowly so hum but then my father's uh sixty five years old and he's he doesn't show any signs of having to cut back either so there's hope for me maybe i'll maintain that yeah that's great well i know in in my family um my father has always been an exercise fanatic in fact uh he's from um Austria uh and he came to this country and one of his first jobs was to teach gymnastics and uh he use to make a living for a while doing gymnastics and swimming and in fact in Austria that was what he did for a living too but uh of course he came over here uh i don't know fifty years ago or something like that um-hum he um it it of course it was much more prevalent in Europe exercise was much more taken much more seriously than it was here in fact it it hasn't it's just now getting to the level where it was in Europe you know now with everybody is going to the health clubs and everything right um he he keeps saying that he was too early he came too early yep but um he and but the irony irony is that i've been overweight all my life and he uh he almost discouraged my brother and i from getting involved in athletics um because he felt that we needed to concentrate on on other things more important things in life uh but now and and he's still into athletics in fact he's eighty two and he is in the senior olympics every year and he always brings home silver and gold medals and he competes against people uh as much as thirty years younger than he is huh uh and he still wins these silver and gold medals good uh but i'm at the point right now where i have some concern my mother has history of heart problems for herself and her family my father had phlebitis and um i'm i'm realizing that i need to do something uh or you know i'm going to suffer for it if i don't especially where i'm i'm about thirty pounds overweight and so i've started an exercise program i'm i'm sometimes i'm a lot more diligent than others but uh i work a fellow i work with is a weight lifter and he's he's uh he's competed and he's uh helped me develop a pretty simple program that involves some weights and and and some aerobics and really with the design not towards being a body builder not towards being you know Mister America but but purely uh uh geared towards being being healthy right right and uh and i'm i'm at the point where i've got three young children i really don't want to have to have problems with uh you know my heart or anything like that right yeah well i've i've managed to i guess the work i do gives me a little bit of well a lot of walking and a little bit of lifting on occasion that's good yeah it's not all sitting behind a desk so that's kind of nice it uh i could sure tell the difference though after the first year or so of being there uh prior to yeah to uh working a steady eight hour job as it were i had been working for a camp and had relatively real long hours sixteen years old and could handle getting up at five and not getting to bed until ten or eleven and yeah yeah yeah virtually working or playing myself to death all day yeah and uh boy after a few years of sitting down and then going to that camp as a camper this time i couldn't even do what i used to do and it was really an eye opener for me to see that even sitting down for a little while sure changes the old body's capacity yeah oh yeah well i i i've i have a desk job i don't you know i don't have an opportunity to walk around all that much uh unless i take it uh and it's but it's gotten better i mean uh for many years i lived in the uh i lived in New Hampshire and i'd commute to Boston every day um so i'd end up sitting in the car for an hour and a half and then i you know a lot of it in car fumes you know inhaling car fumes goodness right and then i'd sit at a desk for eight hours and then sit in the car for another hour and a half now that i've moved to Texas and i work ten minutes away um i have a lot more free time to take walks with the family or go bicycling bicycling or play basketball or baseball with my son and uh uh it just uh it from that standpoint uh leaving that area was a was was turn turn around was good for my health i guess you could say uh-huh yeah my kids and i like to bicycle i tend to be rather sore the next day or two those uh ten speeds and their unforgiving seat that i sit on yeah but they tend to like the parking lot up at the Springcreek Plant the upper limit of it's terraced and its usually unoccupied oh yeah yeah boy you can just you go down hill down hill down hill then turn around and work your way back up and uh it's fun for them we take the long route go up Alma and across the back way come in the parking lot right it takes a couple of hours off the day yeah but uh after all that and i usually end up having to by the end of the day they're usually tired enough where one of them or the other needs a little push along the way and i'm sitting here trying to go my bike and push them too and yeah yeah and uh it gets to the old leg muscles but yeah can't do too much of that or i'll waste away well i i envy you i sat down to uh one of the the nurses did the oh they do that um blood deal oh life track no it was just one of the what is that pulse no not the pulse oh blood pressure blood pressure yeah they sit there in the cafeteria sometimes and take that on your way out yeah and after having sat for twenty or thirty minutes and i get up and walk over to that and sat down and they took it it was pretty low like it usually is it it stays real low yeah i guess all the arteries are open and doesn't have any trouble pumping it all through but uh wow yeah the lady looked up at me and said oh you must be a jogger and i said oh if you only knew couch potato with remote control uh so fortunately i don't know what the cholesterol level is but at least it hasn't clogged up yet yeah well they had that whole life track thing that i participated in at Spring Creek yeah and at the time i was a real mess i mean uh i was eating poorly i you know my cholesterol was everything was borderline my blood pressure was borderline my cholesterol was borderline but since then uh and it had nothing to do with the life track thing but but just just i think well maybe it did you know it makes you think you know we've changed our eating habits dramatically i mean when uh when the phone rang we were making granola um hm and uh uh we're we're trying to cut down on meat and you know we're doing all the all the stuff that the you know all the mags are talking about these days uh um but you know i feel a lot better about it i don't it it comes a real worry but these things are like time bombs and all of a sudden they go off and uh uh-huh right and um i guess looking at my parents and seeing all the problems they've had you know my mother's had bypass surgery and uh and she's she's got  okay so what kind of cars are you looking at well we've uh we've we've test driven the Oldsmobile Delta eighty eight and a Cutlass Supreme and a used Cadillac about three or four years old um-hum um-hum because uh i get married in a couple of weeks and i have two kids and my fiancee has two kids so we need we need a car that's big enough for six um-hum yeah and so that we went i guess it was two weekends ago we went uh car shopping and looked around uh um-hum we found something interesting at Crest Oldsmobile Cadillac up there on Central Expressway um-hum that uh in addition to to getting a new car there they can get you a car that's new but it's been uh a demonstrator model oh okay for uh two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you for a new car uh-huh so they call this program cars and they come with a new car warranty and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that right that's a real good deal in fact my dad recently got a um a Pontiac uh believe six thousand uh-huh and he got a a demo and it's been a real good car and it's it's like new and it only had had very very low mileage on it okay yeah uh-huh sure and so he i think he got a real good deal of course they're fully loaded usually so it's i think it's a pretty good option oh yeah yeah i think so too are the uh Oldsmobiles that you're looking at are they the demos or they used are they new well the the ones that we were test driving were the uh were the new ones there um-hum well now um uh-huh now they may be the demonstrator models but that the sales reps drive around in um-hum and then the Cadillac is is definitely a used car or uh-huh yeah it was in eighty eight the guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes he says it'll probably be gone in a day and it's probably gone by now oh no those things go fast uh-huh um uh of course we're we're not we can't consider getting a brand new Cadillac because those are twenty twenty five to thirty thousand dollars but when they're three years old they're the price already drops in half yeah um-hum so then it becomes uh more realistic right that's what i'm thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new or do i want to look for a used car that's maybe two three years old that but that's you know low mileage and in good shape uh-huh yeah but i just i kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it is it a lemon or or is something wrong with it but i guess that's a risk you have to take that's right that's right well you can reduce that risk by uh having the car checked out i mean you know you you if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this but if you've narrowed it down to one or two um-hum um-hum you can have the car uh uh checked at uh an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don't have any financial interest in it um-hum right and then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting um-hum about how much do they charge to do something like that do you know oh i'm thinking around twenty or twenty five dollars yeah that's not bad no huh-uh it'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car to find out yeah i i would i would think so yeah well it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago and i yes i don't want to think about buying a car for a while i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while and isn't that a good feeling that's right and enjoy watching my savings account get larger and uh you know hang on to the one i've got for a few years because it's it's it's almost four years old but it's still in great shape i have a Mazda RX7 well what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for for three or four years and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it um-hum yeah i just about could really because i think my car if i continue taking good care of it it's going to hold a pretty good resale value and uh that if i consider going the used car route and save up some money i shouldn't have too much trouble at all yeah oh yeah um-hum yeah i would i would think that's true could you hold on for just a moment okay sure okay i'm on a cordless phone and i was picking up uh some background noise so i just switched the channel up on it i didn't want to interfere with whatever they're trying to record so anyway right right that's fine but uh i really i really enjoy the car i have now and i do want to hold onto it and and uh you know enjoy it while it's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever in fact it never has and uh that's right that's right it's been kind of nice and i surprisingly enough after four years i'm not tired of the car at all and um well i'll just hang on to it while it's still being a good car and while i'm not tired of it and while i'm single and can handle a two seater for now and get that out of my system yeah yeah that's right that's right because one of these days i'll be getting a six seater probably too so um eventually yeah the first two cars i ever bought um well uh i've i've bought three cars and i've i've always bought them new the first car i kept for thirteen and a half years and got a hundred and sixty one thousand out of it um-hum wow um-hum the second car i ever bought i drive to work now that just turned ten years old and i've got a hundred and twenty two thousand miles on that um-hum so that that's kind of been the way i've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever um-hum but uh my car is is using two quarts of oil a week now oh my gosh about about a quart every hundred miles oh no so uh but but uh it runs fine all you have it's just very thirsty if i just keep the oil in it seems to be okay but you know that's a sign that i'm going to have to do something sooner or later um-hum yeah right what kind of car is it it's a a Buick Century um-hum are you going to trade it in on this new one or uh no my fiance is selling uh a nineteen seventy eight Cutlass Supreme that she has it's actually in better condition than my car okay uh-huh and so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low um-hum so she's going to sell it rather than trade it in that's probably the best thing yeah um you you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in or maybe more than that as i've learned yeah when i bought my RX7 i uh best offer i got for my other car was twenty five hundred well i turned around and sold it myself for forty two hundred so oh really oh there you go you can do much better i'm glad you're you're taking care of it yourself i i think trading it in they just use that as additional they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying but they just are going to give you that much less for your trade in well that's fact that's what i think so i think you're right but strangely enough the best offer i mean the best bargaining i had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place i got the best price interesting trade in but it's a place in Arlington and i think maybe as you get outside the Dallas area i kind of i bet you it's kind of what i decided well maybe because it's outside of Dallas they are giving a little bit better um-hum prices plus i was going through that TI fleet discount program the okay did you did you use it the car shop place um well it's before they had that oh okay i had gone over to Texins and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the in the fleet program and what you could expect they said you know a five percent that's right yeah over cost and then options at cost and everything so i figured out a price based on that right right yeah that's good but i i guess i got a pretty good deal because i went back to the Town North Mazda right off central and offered them the same price as what i knew i was gonna be able to get it for in Arlington uh-huh right and they said there is no way you can get this car for that price especially if we add on the equalizer and the and the cruise control he said you're going to get a car that's got flood damage or hail damage and they just laughed at me yeah yeah and i went the next morning to Arlington and they gave it to me for that price and what's so funny is they took the car they i knew they were gonna pull it from Town North because that's where the white one was and they had already told me we located one at Town North so it was that same car is that right my gosh and i said like yeah well unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage i got the car off your lot for that price and you and you laughed all the way to the bank oh i did and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup and uh uh-huh that they required you to do and i took it to Town North and sure enough i saw that guy and he recognized me he said he said oh hi Dana and he kind of looked down and saw that car and i'm and i'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day of course when when the place in Arlington yeah yeah yeah went and took the car because i told him there's a place in Arlington that's gonna give it to me for that price he said no they're not and the next day they that's right yeah pulled the white car and took it to Arlington so i'm sure he knew so i loved it i sat there and i just had the biggest grin on my face such a deal i'll bet you did is kind of nice but well Dana it's been really interesting and i appreciate talking with you yeah good talking to you too Don okay have a good evening okay good luck in your car hunting uh-huh bye-bye thank you much bye  okay um i'm real happy with the car i have i have a a Hyundai oh really what kind of car do you have oh uh-huh and i bought it in uh eighty no no no eighty eight or eighty seven eighty eight it's an eighty eight and uh i'm i've taken real good care of it and i'm real uh-huh happy with it but if my financial situation was different there's probably other cars i would like to have oh really yeah me too many many cars i'd like to have too um i bought a car around the same time in eighty eight and it was a um a Toyota Corolla so uh-huh and um i like it pretty well except it's not real comfortable it doesn't give a comfortable ride you know it's it's a cheaper car and it gives a cheaper ride and it's not the luxury car so if i bought one i'd probably want something like a a new Maxima oh that a Nissan is that a Nissan i have a friend that has one that's just gorgeous yeah they not and then oh they do ride nice too in fact when yes really right you don't hear wind noise and all that yeah when i i was sitting i was sitting here waiting for for her to find somebody i was trying to think what kind would i and Nissan Maxima came into my mind uh-huh yeah she has a real pretty one it's kind of a oh it's not white and it's not beige it's kind of a cream color oh God it's pretty it's got a sun roof in it yeah it's a nice car but boy she must have paid a fortune for it yeah really yeah well i'm almost convinced that you pay for what you get because my car in eighty eight was like ten thousand five hundred dollars and it was okay when i bought it you know it was great running around town it's a great little run around car town car because i get good gas mileage yeah but when you're out on the road on a trip like my parents live like five hundred miles away you are exhausted by the time you get there yeah because it's just uh-huh oh really the seats aren't real soft and comfortable and there's only so many positions you can get in and your body gets tired plus you hear the road road noise a lot so yeah i probably do too i like the way my car rides though uh course i have a sun roof and i open it up so i hear i hear the wind uh-huh oh yeah yeah yeah and but it's comfortable to drive i i really don't have much problem with that i think it's comfortable i'm really sold on i you know i i don't remember what i paid pretty close to ten thousand i think with everything all together it came to eleven with tax and everything you know but i'm i'm real pleased with it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and it did you buy it here in Dallas yeah i bought it at Eagle uh-huh well and i get great service there yeah oh really well that means a lot see i used to work at Lemmon Avenue so i that's right across the street from it uh-huh so i just walked across the street and bought a car so to speak yeah you know it was really convenient when i was there because i'd just pull it in during the day you know i worked second shift at that time and i'd just leave my car you know yeah got to see them all the time uh-huh and let them work on it i'd bring it in and go to work and then pick it up i'd go out on break at five thirty and pick up my car it was you know real convenient now it's not so convenient uh-huh yeah well um like how many have you had any major repairs or anything you've had to do to it no not a thing because you know my car's about same age as yours and i've been lucky i haven't had any major anything happen it's been me neither and i've i've been really careful to take it when it needs service i do what the book says and i take it in i took you know for the valves uh-huh for the adjustments at fifteen thousand and thirty thousand and i change the oil every two to three thousand miles and i take real because i figured it was going to have to last me a while you know so i decided no matter what if i had to let a bill go i would take care of my car right yeah because you have to get back and forth you know no matter what yeah and i get good gas mileage and it's just been a great car it's i'm i'm real pleased with it i have no no qualms about and i wouldn't mind buying another one if i had to you know the yeah yeah well that sounds good because you know Hyundai is a fairly new car uh-huh compared to you know Ford and everybody so i i didn't know anyone that had one that's good to hear there's a lot of people at Lemmon Avenue that have them i think a lot of people walked across the street but uh yeah uh there's a couple people that have gone a hundred thousand miles on theirs and it's still in good shape so and yet i know someone that had to have a valve job on their valves and that's about six seven hundred dollars but they didn't take it in and have it serviced when they were supposed to um-hum yeah oh um-hum and you know and i do that i think if you take good care of your car you know i've got thirty a little over thirty two thousand miles on mine how much how many miles do you have on yours that's about what i have thirty two or thirty four i can't remember i just turned over one one or the other do you have the oil changed a lot and everything yeah luckily my husband is real good at that and he knows how and he changes it regularly and gives it tune ups you know replaces the spark plugs and and uh yeah i know that no see i don't have a husband so i have to have it done you know when i did have a husband he didn't like to do stuff like that but i didn't have this car but uh i don't know yeah i bet the sun roof is great i love it i love it that is something i would really want and you know if i bought a new car i would want a sun roof yeah i made i you know i gave up the automatic transmission when i test drove the car i i didn't like the automatic transmission because it didn't have any get up and go and i uh-huh i like to shift so i i got a five speed and the automatic transmission was three hundred dollars and so was the sun roof so i was kind of a trade well i'll take the standard shift but i want the sun roof um-hum oh i see yeah well that's good so oh and i love that sun roof i use it all the time i really do oh yeah i think i would too because you know even i have to drive seventy five every day ooh so i i do i drive seventy five every day so i would i would still you know where do you live up in Plano okay so you come down seventy five right i come down seventy five and then i have to come up in five o'clock traffic you know ooh which where do you work which part the Dallas site expressway there at seventy five and six thirty five so you're in the which building uh SC oh you're in the SC building uh-huh i'm in i'm over in payroll so we're we're in Park Central oh yeah so you are you you're in Dallas yeah Park Central Five you know just across i come to the SC dock every afternoon deliver checks and to go out on the on the trucks so um-hum yeah you know i'm just across the road but i live in Oak Cliff so i drive the toll road every day oh oh yeah that'd be the only way and it's great you know there's never very much well there's traffic but it's never stop and go unless there's a wreck you know i would never drive Central Expressway uh-huh about how many miles is that i go twenty miles one way twenty miles one way yeah see i have about twenty five round trip is what it is yeah that's not too that's not too bad about twenty five miles a day yeah yeah i'd uh i still want that sun roof though that'd be good yeah i'd i like i wouldn't mind having a convertible well i saw a pretty little convertible the other day on the toll road a red one oh gosh it was so cute no it was i don't oh what was it i think it was a Mustang Hyundai or was it um um-hum if i'm not mistaken i think i noticed it was a Mustang and it was new and it was pretty oh yeah so i also like the Rabbit uh convertibles i think they're kind of cute yeah oh i just had a friend buy one and he loves it i bet he does he does he and it's convertible he puts that top down and it's just a fun car oh yeah they are i couldn't believe what he paid for it it was like sixteen thousand dollars they're expensive uh oh my God you know and hear i am thinking this car is smaller than my car and i and i bet it's not comfortable is it comfortable no not really i mean it's you know the seats are typical Volkswagen seats that's right the vinyl you know that's all that is i know but that car is so expensive but you know talking to my husband and he was real impressed with the car the motor and everything in it is just fabulous supposedly it's one of the best built cars yeah i i hear the Volkswagen engine you know is really good well isn't it made by um uh-huh uh-huh oh God Mercedes yes and Kharman Ghia uh it was the little sports car i used to have a Kharman Ghia red one at one time and i loved that car i i wish now i hadn't sold it oh really those are the best supposedly the best built cars so this little Volkswagen that he has he's loving it yeah i'd like to have a Mercedes i i can't see paying as much for a car as you could buy a house for i know i know uh sixty seventy thousand dollars for a car just a little bit out of my league yeah i i can just see parking it at TI you know and then somebody smashing it smashing it with their door makes me so angry or breaking into it we have such a rash of break-ins right right it'd be gone in a week so they have we had we they have had to put security really heavy in our parking lot and people sitting up in the windows watching security because they were coming around smashing the windows and stealing stuff just in our parking lot you know and our parking lot's not um so huge like what you all have over there you know and they we look right out my office looks right out onto the parking lot and i didn't see anything going on and i'm always looking out the window uh-huh and they were doing in broad daylight boy i'll tell you what people just really have a lot of nerve you know break into cars just broad daylight no and it just ruins you too you just makes you sick and then you have insurance you know goes up and it's terrible right i know it and you all had a lot of problems over there too didn't you for a while oh yeah yeah  all right oh okay are you on an exercise program now or yeah i exercise pretty regularly uh-huh i lift weights quite a bit uh-huh um i run occasionally let's see what else do i do play golf some and i work out on a a hanging bag i'm brown belt in karate so i keep up with that a little bit uh-huh oh yeah how about you um the only exercise program i'm doing right now is walking um-hum i've got a nine month old and i'm four months pregnant with my second and so at the time walking seems to be the best it's something i can do with her plus um doesn't tax me too physically um-hum um-hum i have enjoyed aerobics in the past and i enjoy that because i like the group association you know like exercising with other people yeah and um and that's my favorite way to exercise well that's neat but yeah i do walk some too my wife's about five months along so she's been walking quite a bit so that that is a good exercise for that oh yeah it's it's it's nice to do it together too i guess um-hum because my husband and i used to walk together but our schedules don't coincide as well as they used to and so we very seldom get together to walk but when you when you work out do you pretty much do it on your own schedule or do you go to groups or i i i do it on my own schedule um-hum we used to try and belong to clubs or the Y stuff like that but it so difficult to go on a regular basis to drive to drive the distance you have to go and um-hum save the fees we've decided we just save the fees and and buy some of our own equipment so and then you can do it whenever you want i guess yeah yeah i've got a weight bench and we got my wife an exercise bike and i use that sometimes too um-hum so it's a little more convenient but you're i guess you're not as dedicated if you don't drive over do it i guess it depends on the person depends on how motivated you are um-hum because my husband used to work out three days a week with uh at the Texas Instruments gym uh-huh and then i would just go on Saturdays but since the first of the year neither one of us have been going yeah so you know like you said we've been paying these fees and not going so it's kind of a a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it yeah i i think you really have to be disciplined yeah i uh i i try to work out at at least a couple of times a week and i i think you really have to at least twice a week just to maintain the shape that you're in yeah oh with the walking i think they they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial um-hum and we i have two friends that we walk they have babies that are about the same age as as mine and we've been walking every morning at going when it was cold we'd go to the mall it's because you can't take the babies out very easily yeah so uh so we when we go we have about do about fifteen miles a week but the last little while for one the reason or another we haven't been real consistent so it's a little harder when you depending on other people to do it with you um-hum because you have to meet their schedules as well but true but i enjoy doing it more when i've got other people with me than and i usually do it because i want to because i know it's good for me not because you know i don't i don't feel obligated to do it and i enjoy it um-hum if i if i feel too obligated to do it i i start to rebel and i won't be as consistent with it yeah i understand did you exercise between your first child and your second i uh i exercised pretty well up until i found or until i was pregnant and i started having pains so i've calmed down everything except i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the um walking um-hum yeah and i had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful but the the TI rec center has an aerobics program for for um prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing hm and i was going to wait until um about my sixth month and then start doing that i did that with the second baby and um i went to my exercise class exercise class one day and then she was delivered the next day gosh so it it would seem to be real beneficial um-hum yeah maybe it maybe it speeded up the process and all that well i think it made parts of it a lot easier i i is this your first that you're having uh-huh oh okay well then i don't know how much you've been through it but um i think parts of it made a lot easier and i've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other and they said that they'd exercise the one that had exercised was three or four times easier and really and we've i had having both of them natural the first one was natural and going natural the second and and it was it's rough but it's not as as bad as i thought it would be um-hum and i think the exercise helped well that's good so do you work with TI no i don't my my wife has been working with them oh okay well then she could go if she was interested um-hum i think that's what the class that meets on Saturday mornings so she could find out if she wanted to go it's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy and they would talk about exercise and just general things related to the birthing process and so for it's so it's educational as well as it exercise exercise beneficial so yeah at least its something that you enjoy and i know a lot of people that talk about exercise and say well i don't want to exercise it's too much work but there a lot of different things you can do that that are enjoyable that you don't have to you kn ow strain yourself or sweat that's right be real sore afterwards yeah and sometimes that's if you get a little soreness you feel like well i've done a good job because i got worked myself to that point but i guess you don't want to overdue but well have we reached our limit i'm not sure how long we've been talking but yeah i think i think we've talked about six minutes or so so okay well it's been good talking to you it's been good talking to you as well okay i hope your baby goes well comes out well bye-bye thanks yours yours too bye-bye  Dallas about another block over and i'm in Garland well that's funny i didn't expect to have any more calls so i'm not very far away oh okay i thought i was uh through i had done ten oh i don't know is there a limit on it well i thought ten was the maximum okay i didn't know that because i got to be pushing ten some where i lost count around six or seven yeah yeah i've been writing mine down just in case anything you know just yeah i should have been and i just i just forgot to uh so uh we're going you work at TI hm i did i don't any more my husband does oh i i i do but i'm not going to be at the end of this month so oh well where you going i'm an ex TI'er i'm uh i'm officially retiring unofficially i'm going to go to work for a supplier of ours oh how neat well that's a good choice uh i a company called Onum uh it it yeah it's located in Korea oh Onum yeah i know them i used to work with them oh you you you you did i was a mechanical engineer i did uh package design and i uh when we first contacted Onum years ago oh i was part of the Gene Rickey oh okay well you worked with a whole bunch of friends of mine then was part of that yep probably yeah yeah i know Gene's in Sherman now yeah he's been there for since i left oh okay and i was in the Philippines for about three or four years and Gene used to come out and visit us uh when i was in the Philippines and well i worked up there for a year oh yeah he made a lot of trips yeah well the the vice president for operations for Onum stationed in Korea is a guy named Michael Bryant um i don't know him the he used to be a a vice in fact he started four of the TI plants hum and he left TI about eight or nine years ago and went elsewhere and he's he came through town and visited with me and bottom line is i'm going to retire and go to work for him that's sound like a good deal so uh we're going to talk about about advice giving uh giving parents to kids uh selecting colleges you about ready to talk yeah go ahead okay you said you're Judy yes okay Judy okay i'm i feel i'm like i'm almost an expert on this subject i've got two in college and if one doesn't graduate i'm going to have three there by September well how did they decide which colleges to go to and what did what'd you tell them well it's it's interesting because it sort of fits their it sort of fits their personality uh my oldest who's a senior at UTD now she uh uh always our house borders Richland College i mean you walk out our back door and you're on the campus and she uh has always uh never really wanted to leave home and uh it turns out that when she came time to go to college well we're in the Philippines in fact she stayed out there with us for a year then uh uh we brought her back and set her up in an apartment she went to Richland and then moved back in the house when we got back but she just kind of went to from Richland to UTD and it's too bad she's never lived on a campus and she has a younger sister who's a freshman at Saint Edwards in Austin who is living on a campus hum because and she sees what what she's missed out of college now wishes that she'd done something like that well now but at at eighteen you know uh uh i i wanted i wanted her to go away but she was just too much of a home kid yeah that's uh that's kind of the way i was when i started school i was in Midland and when i was looking for things and and and what i would probably recommend to other people was something that i was comfortable with and i wasn't quite ready to be a long ways off uh-huh um and maybe and i knew i wanted to be in engineering so i was looking for a good engineering school so i ended up going to Tech in Lubbock oh okay so i was there i was you know two hours away from home so any weekend i wanted to come home i got in the car hopped you know i was home in a couple of hours and so that worked out real well and yeah oh yeah that that yeah yeah that's not a bad deal well my my middle daughter who's a freshman she has always wanted to live on campus and she'd been kind of a home body i mean this is the kid who who uh when she was little and went to stay over at somebody's house at night i'd always know i'd get a call at ten o'clock to come get her um-hum uh i mean because it when it came bedtime she wanted to be in her own bed but uh she uh yeah uh i was raised in New England and went to school in New England and she always thought she wanted to go to school in New England she and i took an interview trip last year and she was accepted by several of the of the good schools there but when it came down time to make a decision she said dad i don't think i want to go that far away i've never been away before so uh uh she wanted to go to a small school so uh UT like a place like UT was out of the question because she needed to be in a more of a small smaller school environment so uh we went down one uh uh i took a day off from work and um-hum um-hum and we went down uh to Saint Edwards and interviewed and it it just kind of met her her criteria it's a school of about twenty five hundred undergraduates on a gigantic big campus and it's in Austin's a nice city um-hum uh and it's and she's pretty happy i mean she's here she's finishing up her freshman year and she's pretty happy and likes Austin and i got a son though who is a senior at Berkner he is not academically inclined at all he's very uh kind of unacademically inclined he wants badly to go to Tech because that's where all all his friends in the neighborhood are going um and he uh i don't think he didn't apply i don't think he'd get admitted there but he's starting to get enough motivated he wants to go there that i think he'll go to Richland and take what he needs to have to take to qualify in Tech and then try to go to Tech the next year oh well that'd be good i think he'd enjoy a lot it's a it's a good school it's a good place to grow up yeah oh sure yeah right and and he went out there and spent a weekend with some friends here back a month or two and and what i like is that when he saw it i think he's now motivated to to to go to work um-hum oh so those the academic standards will improve yeah yeah yeah yeah and the uh uh in in you know one thing you know in in terms of how how i i would advise people is of course you got to look at what you can afford too and the state school system in Texas uh is probably one of the least expensive in the world um-hum absolutely uh again i mean people think it's expensive but you my goodn ess state schools in Massachusetts and the other New England states cost more than private schools do here and he yeah yes and and a lot of people that i knew had would go to school in some really you you know Rochester and some of these really nice these uh name schools and and of course they would get out but they got they ended up getting more or less the same job i did and then they but they're thirty thousand in debt from student loans yeah they end up yeah yeah you end up getting the same degree and it's it's uh uh now i i think that that what happens is the prestige you you can't you you can't sell that too much no uh beca use after all the degree just gets you in the door yes and it's what you do afterwards it's it's what you do after that that that that that uh it that really judges how far you're going to go with a degree yeah and i think that uh it's getting so darned expensive now i went to a school in Maine Bowden College in Brunswick Maine and uh it's a a small at that time all male school there are more uh uh males uh men's schools than women's schools in those days they're all all the old New England traditional schools are now coed um-hum but uh and you know i'm i'm talking about the early nineteen fifties and you know tuition was six hundred dollars a year my goodness it's eighteen thousand now hm yeah it's incredible now and i don't know how and uh i mean they always have a waiting list a mile long for students and the only thing i did notice is about seventy percent of the students are on some kind of financial aid yeah yeah and they're all going to have to pay it back they're going to be in debt for the rest of their lives and and they're going to be in they're going to be in debt for the rest of their lives yeah uh uh i guess the the main thing if i was recommending to someone like you said you've you've got you've got do something you can afford but then to go to a school that also is is somewhat well known at least in the state for what you want to do yeah yeah because like Tech is known to be a good engineering school and A and M maybe is known more for computers right and that kind of thing i would i would if if you know what you're going to do i think that would be important to deal with too because when you then when you do try and get your foot in the door at the various companies the companies that you would possibly want to work for tend to interview more heavily at those locations because they know that that particular school had a good department you know in in computer science or in engineering or in business or or whatever yeah i i i i think that's exactly right and you know a lot of girls that go into engineering know what they want to do uh you know i've got two daughters that started off going well well well my oldest thought she wanted to major in psychology and she's carried through on that uh uh Tracy is what in April of her freshman year and she's gone from political science to international studies to bilingual education to elementary education and fortunately as a as a freshman everything she's taken has has been uh is applicable um-hum will transfer so that's good yeah yeah it's it's it's applicable to those degrees and and and those are strong degrees all of them in in the school that she's going um-hum and and i i think you made a very good point though that somebody that is really has some direction and knows what they want to do uh then they need to go go to a school that's got a good reputation in that field yeah and uh uh but i would guess a very very small percent of college freshmen know what they want to do i i think to some extent you're right most people have a general idea yeah yeah i and then there's there's probably that probably fifty percent have a general idea and the other fifty percent are waiting to see what hits them when they get there yeah yeah i i went i went off to school wanting to either be a high school algebra teacher or high school French teacher because my two favorite people in the in high school were my algebra teacher and French teacher and uh and i was going to do that until the end of our sophomore year when we wanted uh we came time to sign up for majors and i had taken chemistry for the first time that year and surprised myself i did well in it hum and and sort of made a decision as we were walking me and a friend of mine were walking over to campus uh to to sign up for our majors it was just sort of an off the wall decision and uh uh but i had no earthly i didn't do well in chemistry in high school and had no earthly idea that i'd get my degree in chemistry hm on on the way in so it's uh but i i think uh a person who has some idea like you did is is is well uh you you know that that helps a lot were you uh well prepared for Tech in in your school did you go to public school in Midland yes i had yeah i was in public school i was in all honors classes i was also a a National Merit Scholar oh okay well you you you had a lot of things going and i had the i think the other thing that a lot of kids would benefit from in high school is taking an aptitude test um-hum because there are some good ones out there and i know in in our high school at least they offered several different ones where you went through and you know you answer all these questions back and forth and things it it ended up being things that you liked versus things that you had an aptitude  well uh what do you know what the last repair was uh that that you had done to your car i think the last one we had done on a car had to do with uh the transmission i and i'm not sure exactly what it was that they did i speaking from other ignorance i see right what about your car um well i i i guess the last thing that we had done uh was probably we had to have new tires put on it and uh it's sort of a long story we had to get our car inspected uh for the state inspection sticker and uh-huh uh the the gas station i didn't know this but the gas station if they reject your car uh they put an x on your inspection sticker and and uh you have to go back to that same station to get it inspected oh you can't go to a different one you can't go to a different one and they didn't pass our tires our tires on uh on my car oh so uh what they didn't pass the uh the back tires the two back tires so what i did i went down and bought two new uh tires had them put on the front and then my front tires were just rotated to the back oh uh-huh and uh so i went back to the gas station and uh the guy said well your back tires still don't pass and i said no you've got to be kidding because i i just moved them and i told him what i did and he got his little gauge out and said well these don't pass oh my so then i had to go back and buy two more oh Lord i was so frustrated with that but uh buy two more besides routine oil changes i guess that was about the uh the last last major thing that we've had done to the car well that i had forgotten my uh i i i have a little station wagon that i drive to work and my husband has a a van that he uses in his business i see and he had a similar experience to yours just i'm thinking it was last week or or it it it was certainly within the last couple of weeks right uh went to get his uh sticker renewed and had a couple of little things like the clip that holds the uh oh the muffler pipes right right up up had broken or sheared or whatever and they measured the tread and i didn't know they did that to the tires well see i didn't either until it happened and he had to get two new ones too so i i i'd never heard of it before so my mouth was open the when you mentioned that that circumstance right right well i tell you what ever since then i found a station that uh uh pretty close to our house that you know the guy is pretty lenient on the inspection stickers so uh he's definitely going to get my business i tell you but uh well yeah you you want it you want them to check what's what's needful for your safety and so forth but the other sounds like a fluke when they didn't do it you you you should have known when you went in the first time uh the if there were if you needed four tires okay fine but tell me all at the same time that's right you know that the exactly and uh i don't know it made me sort of question you know their their techniques for testing the cars it was almost like they were just trying to get to me and uh i know they probably weren't but that's uh you can't help feeling that way the outlook yeah yeah that's right and plus me being uh uh not not a mechanic you know i i always uh have the feeling that people are out to get to me and i don't know any better you know so that's that's a common feeling i i i empathize because um i well i'm real glad my husband knows something about cars but when i go in i feel really at a loss right and and if we take my car in to be fixed he'll he'll tell them what he wants and then he'll say well well call my wife if there's anything else that needs to be done and then they call me at work because he he doesn't work near uh uh uh doesn't oh Lord have a phone i see have uh office yeah a phone and and so they'll call me and say well Mrs Parker we've got some good news and we've got some bad news the problem we thought about this morning is not a problem but the real problem is is uh right and so the only way that i the only thing i know to do in in is if it sounds plausible i'll say go ahead and do it but save me the parts or something so i can have him look at it right right and that's the only thing that saved us is is his background there i see well i i wish i would have been paying more attention when i was out messing around with uh my dad when he was uh out looking at the cars he's he's a pretty good little handy man but uh i i never did pay any attention never i never really was very interested in cars so uh i'm i'm just the type that if it's got gas in it it should it should be going that's that's and i need to be better because uh uh we just bought it my wife and i just bought a new car and uh you know we want to take real good care of it so uh sure i'm trying to have the oil changed at the the right times and things like that uh-huh all that scheduled maintenance right that's right that's right you know that uh thirty or forty dollars you have to pay every so many months to to keep the thing in hopefully good shape but uh i think i guess it'd be better to pay it out now than a big lump sum down the road that's the truth that's the truth i always wanted to know a little bit more but i think it was more to show off but right when i was growing up and i before before i was married i was teaching school and teaching down in Corpus Christi and i wanted to be able to at least change a flat tire right between Arlington where my family lived and down there and so i i had one day i had said told my brother i said now i know everybody's suppose to change tire know how but i said i can't do that will you help me will you show me and so i had him out there and he was helping and mother came to the door and said Larry you've got a phone call so he went in to talk to one of his many friends and i i'm i'm down i'm there with this tire off right oh Lord so i thought i have better things to do i can do this myself and so oh i guess i was getting ready to start that was it it wasn't even off so i started jacking it up and and and so forth and somehow or other the the jack slipped it's one of those that has the ratchet kind of thing just taking it off oh Lord right and i reached out to grab it and it caught the the webbing between my thumb and my my forefinger oh it caught the and i couldn't do anything i fortunately it was loose it was no longer under the car and i i i could not get my my i could just see me through the rest of my life with this jack attached to my hand and i i couldn't see anybody on the street no other kids all over so i went to the to the door oh Lord and it was summertime the air conditioner was on the door was closed and i couldn't knock because i had to hold the jack with the other hand i finally with my elbow rang the doorbell and mother came to the door oh jeez and i wouldn't let her touch me i i wanted my brother to help me with this that was a shock the he put the phone down pretty quickly and it didn't take him long to extricate my hand but oh i was scared to death i i i could see him cutting out my my whole palm just to get this little flap of skin out so that's that's how mechanical i am that's hilarious to to get that jack off that's right oh that's a funny story and that was oh that was twenty five years ago so i i've not tried it since oh plus plus before this i had put all the lugs back in place oh Lord right but i had the wrong side out i didn't know there was a right and wrong side the thread worked oh Lord oh jeez and so i was so proud after he got me extricated he looked at went out there to check it over and he just laughed he said Sissy i'm sorry but we're going to redo this they're on backwards huh oh jeez all that work and so uh listen i'll call Triple A uh auto club any time that's right any time that's right well that's uh that's the way i feel i i feel like i i work uh hard enough and make enough money i i can pay somebody to take care of my cars it it it'll save your fingers trust me so uh that's right that's right well hey i appreciate the conversation well i enjoyed it Jay thank you bye-bye alrighty bye-bye  i don't know um do you do a lot of camping well my husband and i haven't done a whole lot of camping we but we bought a van last year and we were hoping to to do some camping in the van yeah um we did go camping in Arkansas not Arkansas Oklahoma uh last year in we camped in a tent and uh there were two other couples with us and there was uh state park oh so yeah um up here some of the state parks are really nice and some of them aren't some of them are pretty rough and it was really nice really um yeah they they just have like outhouses they don't have like a shower room or anything yeah but some of them are really nice they have showers and full bathrooms um um but i don't know i i've been camping a couple times but i'm not a real avid camper uh a lot of people i know are but um i don't i don't know that i i don't like really camping in the rough i like the the the little niceties like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that yeah in fact we went we went once to a lean-to and it um i mean there wasn't any electricity on the camp site but it was all right but we only spent two nights there i wouldn't want to spend more than two nights i wouldn't want to go for like a week but um yeah that would that would be much two nights is good um especially there was a little store close by so it was pretty nice yeah the campsite that we went to was an area that it's right on a big lake and there's a lot of boating out there and we we went up there uh to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit but it was still uh it was still too cold oh really oh yeah it it was pretty early in the year um yeah up here you got to wait till August August till the water warms up well it's not that bad but it's still pretty chilly yeah um i don't know i was i have a tent and i slept out in it in the backyard and stuff but the thing thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything and another thing is the thing seems to get it's dirty you know so you can't keep the dirt out of the tent and yeah i don't know we have a seven year old it's pretty funny like stay out yeah we we have a we have a dog and that's just about as bad as a kid yeah boy he he doesn't go in and out of the tent a hundred times um-hum and use it as a play uh they they like to play in them yeah i don't know how you can really keep uh the inside of a tent clean other other than you know taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something yeah i don't know and and sweeping it out everyday it's really hard to to keep the sand and dirt out of it yeah well what what we were doing we were just going to say we're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night so you know no going in and out and or what he wants to do we had brought his friend along was play in the tent it was like no this is not working you can't do that you get tent all dirty plus you get it all wet because we were at a beach site too did um-hum um did you have another a big tent like uh um for like a looks like a sitting area type you know like a two room type tent no no but you know i was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they they are really nice and um up here we have uh we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime yeah yeah we don't really have a problem with that um in these areas um and even even when in Oklahoma when we camped i really didn't notice a problem with bugs and i noticed that i know that i said that's i've i've lived back east before um and yeah they're terrible they're really terrible uh but there is this one campsite that it that some of them are known that there is one that's out in this big lake and it's it's it's mosquitoes are terrible and then this uh there's this other one that's more up in the mountains but it surrounds a man-made reservoir and there's no bugs that's the whole thing that everyone told me oh i'm i was going to go to Little Little River State Park they go oh that place is great there's no bugs but oh okay because uh we were having a big a really big problem up here in certain areas we were really affected that bad hum but really bad it um almost destroyed the the tourism in one town because of the mosquitoes they're so bad yeah that was it's a really nice area i've been there before and it's really i i couldn't imagine get living just sixty miles north of them but they were plagued they were plagued with them with mosquitoes and you can go out outside in the daytime all right but the minute the sun went down that's when it seems like the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out hum i mean just the very second it's really strange they uh they must uh work on that you know the the it gets cooler when the sun sets and then they all come out well have you ever have you ever taken any of those um what do they call this citronella lights have you ever used those oh oh yeah yeah i never really noticed how effective they were but um because that wasn't really i i bought them and i didn't really get to use them like oh there's mosquitoes let's turn them we just sort of lit them um-hum and um we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes so we didn't really contribute it to that but um i think in an area that's really thick with mosquitoes i can't see all this little uh smoke buckets i call them how they work but they they're suppose to work really well yeah oh i'm in my paperwork here that's what i do when i wait for a phone call i get in my paperwork hum oh to find my most important parts but i don't know i don't know if i'm going to go go i wish was an avid camper and i could really talk about like gardening or something i can talk about that a lot but um um-hum i do want to go again we just moved to a new house into a house so i don't see camping maybe in the backyard but i don't see going on a camping trip probably till next summer yeah i'd i'd like to go camping cross country um i just got married less than two years ago so we don't have any any children yet um so it's easy for you to go and yeah so it's easy to pick up and go and so we have a van and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it um oh God so it's it's not really i guess camping the way people most people picture camping in the tent but i don't know but that sounds like my kind my kind of camping it really does yeah okay um well um that that is the best way to do it is to have a a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent yeah or or get my brother has a real nice pop-up yep and he just he just tows it behind his truck um and he he's got three kids so his kids'll sleep in the truck in the in the back of the bed um and they sleep in the pop-up well those they're kind of nice but they're also um flimsy when you really look at them but then when you get inside they're really nice you know yeah everything's really nice but then when you look underneath it it's just got these little wheels and this just this uh little axle it's like oh my and then a big windstorm it would pick you up yeah he did have a problem uh when he went camping last year in uh Beavers Bend Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma Oklahoma um a storm a storm came in and it started raining really heavy and they were all everybody was trying to flee the campsite and everybody was getting stuck in the mud oh jeez yeah what do you what do you do when you get a i mean like a really violent storm like a tornado just stay in your truck and the i i mean i wouldn't stay in the um well theirs was so bad and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up and they had to get out of there oh so did were they successful yeah they yeah they were but it took them a little while but yeah they they decided that that was enough camping for the weekend yeah so did they get stuck no they ended up getting out they ended up helping several other people though that were that were stuck yeah huh wow so they evacuated it yeah yeah they the whole the whole campsite was evacuated i mean some i think some people that had fairly sturdy um wow vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water i think they stayed yeah but everybody that was real close to the water ended up it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream i know i i always i like to like to get right on the water yeah where the campsite it's so it well like i don't know we have lean-to's up here i really like them like they say they're kind of yeah it's kind of more dirty than anything you know just just they have them right at the campsites yeah they're they're lean-to's they're um yeah they're pretty nice they're they're uh wow it's like a little house except the whole face is open and the one time that we went we got one it was overlooking the water but it was a big embankment i wanted to get one right on the water that was then when we had uh an electrical storm too and it was really it was neat sitting there watching it i mean it was raining when we called in home everybody said oh we were worried about you in that storm  good morning good morning uh okay go ahead yeah i understand the topic this morning is uh our policy in Latin America and you know what we've been doing down there so i don't know no no go ahead as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area it it just so happens that uh our daughter-in-law is Panamanian and uh we have been in Panama and i have worked in El Salvador and we visit Mexico occasionally so yeah we we do have a little information on it here but uh oh very good because actually um when i was in college i visited Mexico several times i was in the Peace Corps and um Peru but but recently i have been following the Middle East rather than oh uh-huh yeah Central America it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit that's that's for sure no i the US policy uh towards Central America as far as uh well i kind of go back to to the El Salvador thing because Texas Instruments had a a plant down there for a while and i worked in there for a little while and at that particular time let's let's see that was seventy three seventy four kind of before the the uh the the uh Civil War really picked up down there and US policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to uh to the government itself you know anything that's that's anticommunist you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro it don't matter what their excesses were and i believe at the time that i was down there that uh the right that uh the government uh the Salvadorian government you know really gotten out of hand yet the uh right wing death squad type situation i believe that that was beginning to form but i don't i i wasn't really aware of it's being you know terribly uh you know rapid at the time that that i was down there i think that really kind of developed a little bit later on but uh our policies seem to be pretty much one of uh you know trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource anyway that Salvador had plenty of and that was people we didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's it's labor right um-hum because everything that TI did anyway we we shipped in and it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here so i didn't feel that we really exploiting exploiting them any did that have um so you don't you don't feel that that we were um exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting and they weren't no uh in the particular incidence that i was aware of now TI wasn't the only ones in there Playtex was in there was uh several other companies and uh uh-huh of course we kind of concentrate on there wasn't much to take out of the country i felt like we're going in and taken all their um their gold or oil or bananas or coffee or anything like that because uh it just um-hum the only thing that they had a great abundance of was uh you know human beings uh-huh did did we tend to um change their attitudes attitudes like some times when Americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt American things Americanism um consumer products TV the whole works yeah i understand what you say there was a uh the time that i was down there i stayed quite a a bit at the uh uh one of the big hotels San Salvador and at the time i thought there ought to be a law against American tourists because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious as a as a group and i saw this in Panama so uh oh you know it's it's the uh the almost stereotype uh-huh you know flowery shirt shorts camera hanging around their neck you know demanding this that and the other thing you know we're we're here and we want this and we want that and that sort of thing that's that's the stereotype that's very strong down there you know that uh the you know that sort of thing i i i believe those of us who were working down there got a little bit more appreciation for you know the local uh culture i really don't believe that we were quite that bad but yet they were having to deal directly with uh you know with the uh the local people uh-huh uh-huh and uh but boy there is a there is a bad uh uh you know the old brash ugly American type uh-huh situation and i saw incidences in the hotel where i just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say oh my God those are those are not Americans they can't be but they are right and uh of course now i i do have to i remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad but i mean it i think it's just kind of the North American situation uh in Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long but i didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing as Panamanians are just about as as uh as as Americans as far as uh creature comforts you know they're uh they're they're every bit uh i i know when my my son was in the Air Force and he was stationed in Panama and he married a Panamanian girl and when she came up here uh you know she's you know except for the language situation some of the cultures she's just about an American you know is as far as TV and uh-huh and you know the the moneymaking part of it and all that matter of fact if anything she's worse but uh uh it it just there's little enclaves down there where you know Americans have a lot of influence uh-huh uh-huh and the local population kind of um you know sort of accepts that but i've also seen the other side of it too uh-huh well you were in Peru yeah i was in Peru Peru but um i there weren't as i recall or at least i wasn't aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers this was when the Peace Corps first are started and it was one of the big targets uh-huh uh-huh and um i don't i don't think at that time at least Peace Corps was uh an obnoxious group in the sense that that we were very controlled regarding number of days off and and you couldn't just take up take off and leave your group and go explore and and things like that oh uh-huh but and i was working actually in the savings and loan program so that was quite specialized although i was living in the slums i was really working with the middle class uh-huh What uh what area did you live in i was up in Arequipa oh okay yeah and um i've heard of it uh-huh so well well is are they is Peace Corps still active down in there i don't have any idea um probably not i mean there were thirteen i was uh Peru Peru thirteen which meant there were twelve groups before mine uh-huh that had gone in and and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development and they were building schools and doing coops and things like that health um inoculation and and things oh has those influences lasted do you know whether the the things that that you and your groups before you did did those did those live on or were they reabsorbed or how no no i believe they did because um some of some of the the Peace Corps uh that i knew of did marry Peruvians uh-huh and have been back and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things and of course the savings and loan program um that was that you know that that just continued to grow in fact after my group i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread and then of course Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's uh uh something that nationalized very quickly and the same with the coops uh-huh well that's that was kind of the the aim wasn't it to get it started and then have it right taken up by the oh okay oh so you know well that's i had wondered sometimes i knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that and i just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know like yeah uh-huh yeah i've you know some of the programs i would have concern about like um the language teaching you know i mean why should we push English and a lot of people were down there teaching English and when they talked about Hungary or someplace one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach language you know to me that's a little bit marginal i did teach economics at the university one night a week and the textbook was in English but basically i taught it in Spanish because i mean uh-huh oh i really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test yeah yeah my brother-in-law teaches at uh Northern Illinois University and they were in China here a couple of years ago and he was over there at uh the University of Shah and and teaching  probably uh the lifestyles and the size of the area we live in and an age can make a very difference in how credit cards are used um at this point in life i do not carry a credit card that i have to pay a service charge on uh-huh none at all huh right uh we used to have American Express and uh Visa that of course there's a yearly fee on i see yeah has it and we got rid of those we now have Discover we have a Visa that does not have a yearly fee and then we have a card that our bank put out on a promotion this year that uh of the first year there is no yearly fee and of course we don't plan on keeping it the second year uh-huh uh-huh yeah that because i'm pretty frugal about things like that that's what we we got rid of an American Express card for the same reason is though we have a a credit union and we get our cards our other MasterCards for free so we don't have to pay a a fee at all uh-huh and that's what i i know people who don't have any credit cards at all and i'm always amazed because i don't know how they can get by without them it doesn't seem like you can do anything anymore without a credit card we find it especially useful because my husband retired over a year ago and we travel quite a bit and we we like to leave a credit card when we check into a motel in case we want to make a phone call or uh-huh whatever which we do pretty often and and uh fact in a lot of motels we noticed from our most recent trip they that you do not even get the telephone turned on in your room unless you've left a credit card at the desk uh-huh uh-huh so i suppose for that reason we will always have a credit card of some kind but yeah i like them too with with us we've got insurance of course but due to my husband's work but by the time like two weeks ago we all got sick all four us and one kid had to go to the doctor twice and then all the other the the rest of us did and he was like six hundred dollars yeah and it was we were we all had it was a viral pneumonia it was really bad and and we were just horribly sick but i mean six hundred dollars i can't come up with oh my uh-huh can you do that on a credit card yeah all the doctors here will take a Visa so that and you know and go to KMart and use the pharmacy to pay for the uh medicines and then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it to come back oh for heaven sakes for the drugs yeah uh-huh you know and so our part of it was still twenty percent but twenty percent i can payoff in one month whereas you know then i got to wait for the rest the rest of it to come back from Aetna but it basically floats uh-huh you know during the the time because we've got a thirty day grace period on the credit card as long as you pay it you know within that time and that's usually enough time for the insurance to get back oh uh-huh uh-huh i try to make that our biggest use of credit cards i know people who are so in debt people who have five Visa cards i can't believe you know it's like why did you go get they charged up one so then they but they were still paying their minimum so their credit rating was still good uh yes uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and and you would you know they get this in the mail say oh well we can't use that one anymore we'll just get another one and that's like who you i have a girlfriend who has one that her husband doesn't know she has now uh she must rent a p post office box or something or i mean she couldn't beat him to the mail every month i wouldn't think oh yeah because they both work and they uh he's a fireman so he's home two days a week that she teaches and would not be there so i don't know how she manages it but she keeps that a secret and i would not want to pay her monthly uh-huh interest rate on the thing it just has to be awful because it oh yeah but that's that's a good way to make a big problem in your marriage real quick gosh that's just dishonest oh oh i would think so but they've been married almost thirty five years so i think they've done things like that to each other for a long time oh well maybe maybe they'll be all right i know in mine if i did something like that and then my husband found out jeez he would just be well i i think i would feel the same way i'd i'd really feel like i'd been deceived you know that that wasn't the thing to do uh-huh yes yes well many many many many years ago uh i bought wallpaper we have a large kitchen uh dining kitchen family room combination and i wanted to paper it and i bought wallpaper from Sears catalog on my Sears card and at that time i was only able to pay about ten dollars a month which meant i was taking about eight dollars a month off uh-huh the balance by the time they got their interest out of it and it took forever to pay it off and at that point i promised myself i would never pay interest on a credit card again so that's kind of been my motto um yeah we've tried to do that we've paid ours off you know all the way down to where we had everything down to zero and especially right before i i quit work two years ago to stay home with the kids and right and before i left we had everything paid off we were in great shape we were putting money you know because we were both working we were finally putting money in uh-huh but we've gone back the other way to some extent because because just because there are times when you just can't pay it all uh-huh uh-huh because there are just too many bills well as you say when you're taking children to the doctor and adults too it does make a difference our children are matured out of the home and uh our needs are much different than they were yeah uh-huh uh when we were raising a family i think back then we just now we feel like we might could live without one but uh we have a Discover card and i have to laugh about the cash back do you have one of those oh isn't that silly i i sent that one back because we had used it for a year and we had used a thousand dollars worth during the year and what we and and i think we got back fifty cents or something it was like please what is this this is and the interest on it was was eighteen or nineteen percent did you yeah yeah oh and our Visa card was we could get through our credit union was like fourteen percent so we just we sent it back we yeah we keep gas credit cards and we have Visa and then i have started my own business i have a photography business and i went ahead and got a separate Visa just for that photography business because there are things that i have to buy yeah and with my photography when i when i take things to the lab to get developed it's several hundred dollars at a time and i was using up all of our personal credit uh-huh with my photography business even though again it's paying off every month because i'm i'm putting everything uh-huh i'm i'm uh you know i'm getting the pictures and i'm taking them back to the people i already have their money but i wasn't depositing them until i gave them the pictures back uh-huh uh-huh another practice i found i'm going to have to stop hot checks you wouldn't think for a for a twelve dollar school picture that uh that people would write a hot check but they do oh oh i see oh dear well uh-huh i think those are the same people who have their credit cards uh charged up to the max and that's just a way of life i guess i guess it's just you know and when i think about that lady this this particular lady who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced and i sent it through you know sent it through the check through the bank once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh for a returned check so now she's already doubled the price of her check and i've s ent it through a second time because they said there's money in the account now uh-huh you know and and if it doesn't go through the second time that woman's out thirty bucks for one twelve dollar check it's never quite made sense to me but then uh for one twelve dollar check when my husband was in business he had one customer who said that he had to use credit cards because he spent more than he made every month and he was perfectly serious about it gosh so i don't know why he you know didn't go ahead and project to the fact that eventually that was going to catch up with him but yeah he's going to have a debt going out the ear uh-huh i was very glad my husband retired and got away from that kind of thing so we've we have a little problem with our gas card we're uh we've always used a Mobile card because he was affiliated with Mobile Oil and uh uh-huh we it's very difficult to find their stations so i guess that's one reason why we use uh we've used Discover and Visa quite a bit for fuel even uh uh-huh yeah well we have a lot of Mobile stations around here and i used to use that card almost exclusively but now they're charging the extra five cents to use your credit card and Texaco and Chevron and somebody else is not anymore they'll take it you know at the cash price or you they'll now let you write a check if you have their card so you pay for it immediately instead of um you know putting it off for a month uh-huh i thought that was illegal what's that writing a check for gas no no no to uh put a surcharge on a credit card of well all of them down down here you had a cash price for gasoline and a credit card price oh so what they're doing they're discounting for cash is the way they're because i think it is illegal to add a surcharge so right that's that's supposedly that's that they're looking at it differently it amounts to that you have to pay extra if you use your credit card but uh-huh right and and they've changed that now now stop it go play and leave me alone yeah and so i'm using the other ones now because they're just as easy to get to and then they're nickel a gallon cheaper so yeah so what we're saying is that we use a credit card when it uh is convenient but if it's going to cost us money we don't though yes we try not to we're probably the only two people in the United States the bank the banks don't want to hear from us because they want those people who charge it up to ten thousand dollars uh and then get all yeah and then pay fifty dollars a month and it all goes to interest probably and leave us uh-huh oh i guess they must they must make a ton there's not too many places you can make eighteen percent interest on things anymore that's right that's right that's what we need see you and i need to get in the credit card business we need to start our own credit card if you can yeah because you sure can't get that interest anyway else gosh i guess so that would be wonderful wouldn't it huh-uh huh-uh not on those CD's we're trying to live on uh yeah oh yeah ours are like seven percent we've got one and with with IRA stuff in it and uh uh-huh jeez you can't get any interest rates yeah my folks have just retired just in the last couple of months my dad has and uh they're trying to figure out you know what they're doing with stuff and my mom's in there cutting up the credit cards you know can't use these anymore and um-hum sure sure yeah well like i say the only reason we do in fact i when my husband and i were  okay Charles uh gun control what are you uh for in favor or no comment i'm very much in favor of gun control oh you are yes i am well this should be very interesting because i'm against it i don't i don't mind people owning guns i just think it should be a little you know a little a little more regulated well you know uh now here here's something that uh first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic uh weapons yes uh now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons i believe that's correct uh-huh and yet their uh the gun control enthusiasts are are uh preaching about the gun control and how they should be have we should have stronger laws and what not um-hum i don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have that would certainly help i'm sure now this is not just a state law this is a federal law controlled by the Treasury Department um-hum yep uh for fully automatic weapons and uh all right now for instance in California where they passed the uh um-hum uh semi automatic or or uh now what was it they called them um-hum the military version attack weapons or something yeah right uh-huh uh how how is that going to affect the uh sports weapons i mean rifles that are automatic or semi automatic um-hum yep i really don't have any problem Jack with you know uh people using firearms for sporting purposes i don't have any problem the only thing i i am in favor of the seven day waiting period i would like to see that see that happen i uh-huh well now uh i've got to admit i'm inclined to agree with you there um-hum uh even though i am a member of the NRA and they are against they their reason being that well if you let one little law get through pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another and so forth and so on um-hum right yeah i understand that and you've got to admit that Congress does kind of look at things that way um-hum that's true i i like i say i don't have any problem with people using firearms you know for sporting purposes or hunting purposes i just think it's just may be a little too easy you know to acquire one on on a whim of some sort uh that that's true uh now did you hear about the the control that they have up in Virginia i'm not sure i have uh it it's it's a little hard to believe but they can uh of course like just like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law anyone ever convicted of a a felony is cannot purchase a weapon um-hum and they don't have a waiting period because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons and the uh when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in uh uh Virginia um-hum the salesman just calls some number and uh punches in your name and if it comes up negative okay fine and you get your gun your gun right then and there i see uh but they are the only state that does it hm that's interesting and uh according to Virginia it didn't cost all that much um-hum and frankly i i don't understand why a state doesn't have those records available anyway uh uh at least yeah yeah you would think they would uh records of of uh known felons which are available to local police departments um-hum yeah right yeah i'm surprised that more states doesn't do that uh uh uh certainly those those records are available and all they would have to do is expand it um-hum yeah right to uh uh well connect them into a modem somehow um-hum i wouldn't think it'd be that difficult to do well Virginia is not a particularly rich state and they managed to find squeak out a few bucks to do it yep right and uh it's uh uh one hundred percent successful hm that's interesting yeah i just heard about this last week uh they were bragging about it with uh uh yeah they should have have pride in this because it's it's a good system and it's working well absolutely yeah i agree and they don't need that seven day waiting period uh-huh because the whole idea of that waiting period was so that uh it uh the police could check up on you yep well you know what's going to happen there those files are going to back up on somebody's desk just a that typical bureaucratic work um-hum that's another uh uh thorn in my side bureaucratics uh-huh yeah right i agree yep right politicians i was just thinking there's so anyway well we seem to be one in favor and one against yeah i guess that's about right although neither one of us are are uh really uh uh dyed in the wool uh we but we both uh yeah i'm not totally rigid on the subject i just think there should be you know shouldn't be quite so easy to do well there should be some way of checking now here in in Texas uh all you need is a driver's license uh-huh right um-hum and uh even felons can still get a driver's license sure so i i don't think they are too well they're not rigid enough here in Texas yeah that's true but don't tell the NRA i said that i won't i promise i won't okay i promise they're liable to tear up my membership you say you retired a year ago yes i did uh-huh i'm looking forward to it in about a just just over a year myself yeah i rea lly enjoy it i stay pretty busy uh uh-huh i do quite a not quite a lot i do some uh volunteer work here in Plano i i have a few uh handicapped persons that i you know try to do things for help them do oh uh-huh well uh i bought a motor home here four four years ago and i have been living in it ever since and i'm looking forward to just traveling uh-huh that's uh sure i can understand that i have four sons scattered all over the country and a few few grandchildren and i'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them um-hum yep that'd be neat sure would well Charles good luck to you on your okay nice talking to you yeah nice talking to you too take care now bye okay take care bye-bye  so what kind of weather have you had in Dallas well it's been very windy and it's uh probably unseasonably hot for time right now really yeah see i didn't i don't i thought my uh i thought i live in Euless and i thought it was pretty normal but anyway but i guess you're right though it has been real hot because it um i've had to use the air conditioner in March and that is pretty usual yeah we've already had to use that and we've had like i meant this is probably typical though uh with like tornado weather and tornado warnings and um uh-huh so uh you know i i forget from year to year i'm getting too old but the um it it the the the wind's blowing very hard but i guess uh you know we're just out of March and uh will bring the rain in April yeah yeah i know the trees are real pretty right now and everything and uh i don't know i know the pollen is real high but i think it's higher than usual isn't it yes it is seems very high it hasn't bothered me but i know the people that have allergies it seems to be a pretty high yeah i know it's been bothering me a lot but yeah i think normally i think the weather overall has been um probably like you said probably a little bit warm and so a little bit warm and a little bit uh blowy i think anyway so we basically live in the same area so it's real hard to really hard to make too big of uh different comparisons right yeah i know i just think it's been warm and it's been hot and i like it and it's beautiful and all the trees are pretty and i wish it would stay like this all the time yes i could stand this all summer so yeah i could too and uh gah i don't think we can say anything else really i don't think we can either let's cut off yeah that sounds like a good deal well you have a nice day and we'll talk to you later bye you too bye-bye  okay um let's talk talk about the Middle East situation the US involvement in i guess even though now that it's all over with you know it's well it is over but i don't think we're out of there by any means and uh and i wonder are we going to set up uh you know peace keeping type forces for long term and you know is that something we should do or shouldn't do i don't know i don't know uh i understand that the US talking about leaving more of its planes and things over there uh i guess they uh they were anti US in that region and now they're you know like Syria and uh um Egypt you know had some had some pressure against the US but now they now and they wouldn't allow us to have a base in the region but now i think they're rethinking that i think that's true because i think they saw the support that came through that's right the other thing that i think is good for like American businesses are to be involved is the the reports that i hear back and of course on the news i i try to listen and and also read between the lines you know uh-huh but uh they said that because the Americans you know took such a proactive stance involvement involvement in the war that like so much of the building business and rebuilding Kuwait and things like that will go to American businesses where as before they may be dealt with Japanese firms or other people they said even though the Japanese um-hum were involved monetarily uh they fill like the first first priority ought to go to American businesses which i guess will be good you know which will be good for our economy right right but i you know when since they have get so much of our money for from oil anyway boy don't you know i mean we don't seem to slow down even when there's a crisis no no um yeah i think that's that's a nice gesture on the Kuwaiti government part to do that and uh but i yeah and a few people i guess will make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth i imagine your oil companies they may see a probably the first big rise in business they've seen in years i'm right go over there and rebuild all those um-hum i think it's such a shame that Iraqis had to just go destroy everything everything i was just i do too i mean what's what good is that i mean if i can't have it you can't have it you know that sounds like something a little kid would do you know yeah but look at their war that was his whole war is is i'm not satisfied with what Iraq has i want what everybody has that's right and and you're right it's like you you you see two little pre school kids fighting over a toy you know um-hum um-hum so i i'm a little concerned about you know i know they're putting President Bush right now in uh awkward position concerning the the the uh the treaty over there right now you know what the what am i trying to say the uh deal with the uh supporting the uh Kurds well supporting the Kurds but um you know where the the cease fire i'm trying i forgot yeah you know because he right right the cease fire he wants he wants them to uh uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease fire but at the same time he's not wanting to go in and say okay i'm gonna fight your war for you which which i think is is right right you know if it's an internal thing i don't think we can walk in and say gee i think you're right you're wrong you know we're not the judge and jury um-hum uh but i know that that's causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like geez you you told us to stand up against him but you're not helping and so i think he's in a pretty awkward position now and i i i think we ought to help got to help us right you know maybe supply some arms or something yeah supply arms support them if they need help but i don't think we ought to be over there fighting it for them and and so i think he's done good on that stance yeah i think Bush handled has handled this uh whole situation quite well he stood up to to the bully and uh yeah didn't back down and uh and uh uh Saddam Hussein miscalculated all along boy i would say thinking that it he wouldn't commit US lives and and forces and and monies to just to liberate a little country that's right and uh and uh then then he underestimated underestimated his ability to uh to uh wage a war with us i mean uh it's one thing when we all came over there and said okay here we are get out and he said no i'm i i can i can win a war with you guys yeah yeah and that and that was a a horrible miscalculation i mean i agree you know they had advertised and and said news that he had the fifth largest army well he may have but you have to well not anymore but you have to have loyalty you have to have people who believe in your cause uh not anymore right you know if i i i i know they tried to turn it into a holy war because to them that is what's honorable you know to to if you die in in a holy cause but but i think they're smart enough see there was nothing holy about it we just wanted their land and took it you know um right yeah right yeah he he is not a Saddam Hussein is not a religious person but he uses it sure when it when he sees it to his advantage sure and uh and i think the people were smart enough to realize that you know Hussein that that i think they're afraid of him is what they are the population is is afraid to speak out against him and uh and uh and i don't think he's going to be there too much longer well i hope that's true uh someone's going to assassinate him you know i mean yeah i would think so i would think that you know it i guess in the back of my mind i think like maybe the Israeli Israeli Massad probably has ideas of going in and you know basically i i thought they uh yeah yeah showed a a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything and but i don't believe for a minute that that means that they don't have ideas and plans of their own um-hum that's right right uh but i do agree with you i think President Bush handled it all politically very smart you know getting the support of of the other Arabs and other nations in the world and and i think that's how you have to go into something like that yeah right right i've heard reports that uh President Bush was staking his future on this uh this war and that uh setting a precedent saying that um this League of Nations uh will will always combine against bullies and and to stop this kind of stuff in the world any any would be bully would think twice if he knew that you know there's this United Nations or world government or whatever they keeps talking about with that that will that the whole world will deal with you well and don't you feel and you can't get away you just can't do it and get away with it and you know hoping that you know because it's a it's a world thing and and and and nations will combine against you that's right a nd uh you can't you know can't just do this and don't you think that long term that's been a big boost for the United Nations i mean the United Nations has been there for years but all of a sudden uh oh yeah had no had no teeth yeah there're some teeth behind it and some fact that when they have sanctions and and we support things like this it means something right and i think that's good for the strength of the United Nations yeah people i uh i guess i feel sorry for just the average you you know Iraqi Iraqi who's had to go through all this and and suffering i'm sure with with no water you know yeah and rebuild from nothing no electricity you know sanitation must be terrible living conditions must be terrible and yes yeah and it's not getting any better the sanctions are still on that's true you know except for a few medical supplies they're allowing through now and uh powdered milk i guess for babies and things and until they i guess yesterday they came out with this uh these these rules i guess or whatever and they for a permanent permanent cease fire and the Kuwaitis right they supported it um-hum Kuwaitis said we don't want to have to go repay Israel for all the bombing we did that was in there you know but that's only fair that's right yeah they did ask that they build up uh Israel and Kuwait and i think they should have to yeah yeah they lost yeah the it's going to be really tough for them to swallow but but we don't want a Kuwait there that's also you know just has no power at all and and and that you know because Iran still isn't too friendly with them well that's true and and we don't want you know it'd be be stabilized to the point where Iran will say now is our chance you know go in and wipe them out and well i don't think Iran's under the same type of madman type leadership yeah yeah but there's always the possibility i guess yeah yeah since Khomeini died over there things have got a little more normalized normalized not quite as radical a stance more moderates are in power now i think so i think i think the person who really maybe at this time has a hard road to tow is uh Jordan's King Hussein because he really yeah kind of tried to straddle the fence you know he he wasn't necessarily for Iraq at the same time he didn't feel like everybody else ought to be going against Iraq was put in the middle yeah well yet so many of the his citizens are the uh the what what Lebanese yeah who who were hoping this would get evolve into a war against Israel right and uh trying to connect with Israel all that time and there really was no connection at all none and uh but boy those Lebanese in in Jordan they were saying you know this whole war is Israel's fault because Israel told the United States to attack Iran it was all you know like like Israel controls our government i know and isn't that amazing the way that they'll find their cause and and and no matter what situation they see they're going to find their cause whether it's truly exists or not uh you know right well one thing i i did learn is is how deep yeah and the the hatred runs toward Israel by a lot of countries i know they just hate i mean anyway anyway they can you know they can see to to to to connect them to something and hate them more i mean just they just i understand most of the land is now Israel they bought that's true actually purchased it and and and then moved in and started a country but but see you're also getting back to the the ages old problem of Arab Israel conflict as far as personalties and who's the selected one of God and it theirs ties in so much to their religion and oh right oh yeah right right and they both have holy holy sanctions so it's very different things than what we face  well how do you think women's roles have changed well that kind of caught me by surprise it's kind i think i think that they have changed drastically i mean i think about people like my mother who you know gave up their careers and stayed home to raise kids and um you know played a really subservient role in the family and i just don't see that anymore at all uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh even women who do stay home to raise families i think that they are still thought of as equals in in the role you know as far as the role in the family and society goes well i i uh just in my lifetime i know that the role of women has changed drastically also my mother when she began having her family she quit her job and stayed home until uh-huh i'm the youngest in my family until i was uh in junior high school old enough to care for myself when i got home from school um but i think that uh the changes in the next twenty years will probably be just as drastic you you'll see more women CEOs and more women holding public offices yeah definitely i think the biggest problem uh the biggest change that needs to be made is the way that women are paid oh i agree i mean you know it's just the statistics are just staggering that when they make like you know sixty cents on the dollar for what men make for the same jobs and that i mean i can get really angry about that yeah it it's probably all it it's the role of women is is in an evolutionary stage so we i'm sure it will eventually evolve to where it is equal it just hasn't reached that point yet because women uh haven't yeah been in positions similar to men for that many years relative to how long men have had those types of positions well that's true but you know i'm a single parent trying to raise a child and it really upsets me not to be paid you know the same for my job now i don't see that so much in my job but i know in other professions um i know that it's true i know you know friends of mine that are affected by that and uh just you know it's just not fair no it's not fair i don't know what to do about it well there's not much you can do except for yourself individually and and stand up for your salary i mean for what you want in your own job and if if it's not going to work out go find some place that will do what you want to do yeah yeah and then too i think that you know i think a lot of women who have been forced into the workplace unwittingly just because it you know to raise a family nowadays it takes two incomes they have to work and then i think the majority of the time they get still get stuck with most of the you know running the house type chores you know taking care of the kids and you know arranging their schedules and being responsible for those types of of things i know that i do know some men that that participate quite actively um you know in in things but i know a lot that don't so it's just a real shame you know i think when you look at the changing role of women you have to look at the changing role of men too because they're directly related uh-huh well i think it during this in this evolutionary theory that i have here that men will eventually evolve around to where they participate more in the home because when it gets to the point to where that the house is dirty and the kids are dirty and and mom's not home she's at work men are going to gradually learn how to do those kinds of things yeah well they may yeah i think eventually but some men don't see some men just don't care well at i the the the generations that are being raised now by working mothers i i are are a little more in touch with yeah the household chores and duties and what has to be done so i think over a couple of generations time it will all change because it's really been uh my generation yeah i i agree with that grew up for the most part with mothers in the home but again my generation plan of women plans on working and not being at home uh-huh yeah so it will be my children who really make big changes i think because that they will probably the majority of children now are at home without their mothers well or in some type of a day care or something because so many women work now right in day care yeah i agree i uh you know it's fun being single it's like i almost have to work right now i'm at home because i am recovering from surgery but uh uh-huh you know i really resent that in that i don't have that choice to be able to stay home with my child but uh i guess as long as you are single you have to support yourself nobody else is going to do it for you yeah yeah so well how do you feel about women in public office do you think that that's going to grow and how far do you think that's going to go in the next ten years or so well i think that that there's more you know there is definitely more women in public office uh i think it's going to be a long time before we see a woman president uh i don't think that's going to happen in the next ten years i don't uh-huh think that's going to happen in the next twenty years but uh you know i think that there's progress and i'm not very political so i don't really know you know any i don't know any statistics on you know how many women run for public office and how often they're defeated yeah i don't know any statistics either but it's it's probably going to be the same type of situation that that uh the black people have gone through it took them well black men long time to to get up to the pay scales of the white man and now i think it it's feasible for a black man to be president yeah yeah i think we will see a black a black man as president before we see a woman president uh-huh and since since this evolution or this this progression of black male salaries and all that was all before women were heavy in the work place i women will probably go through the same type of deal uh-huh same type of battle yeah type of deal it's just further down the road yeah uh i don't know i think a lot of um states are uh do you live in Texas you know because we now we have a woman governor and of course Dallas i do you live in Dallas yes uh-huh no i live in San Antonio in San Antonio well we have a woman mayor do yeah yeah you do now and uh we have a woman mayor now too in Dallas and Houston has had a woman mayor for a long time because i used to live there too yeah yeah well Texas had a woman governor a hundred years ago or whatever Ma Ferguson oh did they oh i didn't know that yeah yeah i think it was Ma Ferguson i know Texas had a woman governor huh was she elected or was it something that i think she was i'm not sure it was a hundred or so years ago so i i don't know i'm not real up on past history or anything uh-huh that's interesting i didn't i i i didn't know that but uh i i'm thinking it might have been the kind of deal where her husband was governor and he died or something yeah that's right why i asked if she was elected or if it if it was something that was passed passed down to her through through the ways that the laws work i'm not sure but uh i'm surprised i really am surprised you know that major cities you know especially in a state like Texas would elect a woman governor yeah and uh like i said i really have no interest in politics it's just not my field but uh you know being a woman i don't know even that i would vote for a woman in the high offic e i wouldn't now because i don't know of one that's that's equipped to handle i certainly i wouldn't have voted for Ann Richards for governor and uh i can't say that i would vote for a woman president now no i why i didn't but uh we might see a woman vice president that wouldn't surprise me and then of course if something happened to be uh i'm sorry yeah if something happened she would be president but it would not be something that she were elected to uh-huh the the problem i'm sorry go ahead i uh i just i don't think a woman president is anywhere in the near future if not just for the just for American prejudice uh-huh the world several major countries in the world that we deal with all the time don't respect women as business people so a woman president would be is that right laughed at by other countries because they wouldn't respect her as a business person nope what about Margaret Thatcher wasn't she fairly she was i thought she was real well real well respected she was but i don't think that England deals as heavily with with like for instance the Arab countries i don't know all the details of it but i i know that for instance in Saudi Arabia women are just uh-huh oh yeah and in uh my mother has done business in Germany and it was very difficult for her going over there because they just don't have very many business women uh-huh and and the men basically see a business woman and ask them to go get coffee or something it's just it's very difficult to be well respected and and Margaret Margaret Thatcher had been in office it was probably very difficult for her at first but yeah well she comes from a a country where the model  i'm not sure i even know where to begin on this mess oh it it is a mess i do believe though a lot of speculative speculative buying and investment on speculation uh too many large deals with too much risk uh uh-huh oh definitely um-hum bad deals with friends and and associates of friends and on it goes over a long period of time and i think yes uh-huh um-hum it i think it's a a type of situation where okay the first investment didn't work but if we throw a little bit more money in on it maybe this one may you know and try to get our money back yeah throw good money after bad you mean exactly exactly those you said it's just not doesn't work that's that is that is some of what some of what i had read is that's part of cause of it now as to the question of what to do about it yeah oh heavens i would uh it has to be government regulation oh yeah it but you know it it's it's i don't know it's not something i know a whole lot about but uh it's such it's such a big huge complicated mess i don't either but the other thing this Dickson that they convicted he only got five years oh uh-huh i know i couldn't believe it so that's going to leave a message to other people that yeah he can be out in twenty months they said well yes but he's in very poor health so you know twenty months may mean a lot longer for him but still yeah but yeah but still i i health and health and everything i mean if yeah it's our money it's our taxes that have to pay for this mess oh that well there are too i think there's too many savings and loans period there's you know you you drive down the street and there's one on every corner this is true this is very true and and it it i think it's too easy to to uh form one that you know because i mean look look in Dallas they're everywhere they were everywhere and then then they started being taken over by bigger bigger ones and then they just the bigger ones took on the little one's debt and then it it just snowballed and that's probably another cause of the problem we are looking at right now yeah it's it it there's just it just seemed like everybody and their brother had a savings and loan this is a very true thing i didn't think about that part of it you know because you know i have never i'm uh we're originally from Missouri and there are you know mostly banks and maybe a couple of savings and loans in the area i mean i have never seen so many as there are down here uh-huh oh really that's interesting they're they're they're just everywhere and and you know set up in trailers i seen one on Preston Road that was set up in a trailer for a while before they built the little building oh yes yes this is true oh how funny and then uh and then uh it went out uh i mean i just wonder how much that cost us yeah and how many people lost money on that lost money in that thing but who but uh who knows it's that is scary i didn't think about that well they need to prosecute the people who are taking the millions and millions a lot a lot better than they are have been Dickson is the only one i even heard of i mean there may be more that they are prosecuting but Dickson is the only one i even heard of they must be getting some on the national level i think i've read various things but i just no names come to mind because if he only stole six stole six hundred thousand dollars that's just a drop in the bucket compared to some of them that were were skimming millions yeah because that's a drop in the bucket to the taxes we're going to have to pay to to make up for this yeah yeah because there are bigger fish i know i mean otherwise it wouldn't be in such a mess that the the stealing because uh stealing and leaving the country probably they can't they probably can't find them what the deal is oh you know you've got a good point there but uh eventually you know the the tax money is getting extremely low on the FSLIC i mean they're in they're getting they're getting so low it it's almost in trouble and and where's where's that going to come from and the and the other thing is they said the insurance the uh insurance agents the insurance industry is beginning to resemble the savings and loan industry so they they say the next big crisis could well be our insurance oh yeah oh yeah that's and that's frightening that is frightening because as another uh my car insurance is frightening right now i cannot believe how much money i pay oh oh our car insurance i can't either for for uh for nothing for almost nothing well and i just carry the absolute minimum required by law right and i'm paying i mean every quarter i'm paying like five hundred dollars a year and that oh well you don't pay we we keep full coverage down here on everything because well it's not it's not that bad but that's getting off the subject uh oh my but uh but the you think that they that they could come up with a better system of regulating these these little bitty uh savings and loans that uh well i you know the problem is who is they and you get they is the government the government yeah that's what i meant Congress but you get you get into when you start getting them to do things you get into a lot of special interest groups again yes exactly exactly and lobbying oh you know there's a big and you know and and would that make it worse or would that make it better or would that offer new opportunities for other people yeah that's true that's true that's what scares me when you get into that type of situation you know if you are going to change it watch out for the person that's changing it they may put another loophole in that um-hum yeah makes it even worse wasn't even there to begin with yeah and and and people like us never hear about about what's really going on and what they what they're really doing and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because they're there to sell newspapers that's the problem with the news both the on television and the paper yeah yeah television is worse television is worse well all they're there to sell you know or to entertain even worse and uh not to transmit information yeah uh-huh yeah that's yeah oh exactly what makes so what we get is so garbled that who knows if we even have the ability to decide anything yeah yeah we got these people up in Washington deciding all this stuff for us and we don't even know what they're deciding so it it's and whose best interests they represent us or someone else and how many of them were invested in just how many of them have invested in a savings and loan in in a savings and loan or own a or has a brother that owns yeah yeah oh yeah it's really a scary scary thing yeah but i'm it's one of those one of those things that i just don't know where the answer lies it's just it's just it's going to uh it it doesn't seem like it's going as badly as it did in the past few years it's kind of slow because the closings has kind of slowed a little bit well now there was an article in the paper this morning in the business section how tough it was to get a loan approved anymore oh really yeah when when you know when you're trying to buy a house how incredibly hard it is to get get a loan approved simply because they're they are tightening down so much uh-huh huh well i can see why i can see why i can see why because they were loan they were loaning money to everybody and anybody that i mean they didn't check up on people they were loaning people ungodly amounts of money that were that that that couldn't pay for it and you wonder how in the world these people got their loans why look at look at the i thirty condos i know somebody at TI that bought one of them things uh back when they first opened uh-huh oh yes you know that big scam and they just they just left town they just they just packed up and left town smart move and i mean i mean they left well yes but no because they uh they left their loan hanging yes they they just oh did they oh that's not and that happened that happened a lot in this area people just packing up and leaving their houses and leaving the the banks and the savings and loans out to dry on the loans on the car on house loans well but they are hurting their own credit that way hey i know people that it does they don't care it wouldn't i am extremely touchy picky picky picky about my credit rating but but i know people that just don't care what they done bankruptcy means nothing to these people and it hurts all of us it when they declare bankruptcy it's you and me that have to pay for it and these people don't care oh absolutely yeah because they can you know they write all that and people that write things off as bad debt um-hum that lowers their threshold of income of what they have to pay taxes on which automatically automatically makes our taxes go up because there is so much that has to be paid um-hum oh yeah uh-huh oh of course and if this guy is exempt from paying it we have to pay more that's exactly right so it's just we got to take up slack and so it's it's it's a lot of people just run running out on loans that they couldn't pay for in this area i mean you just can't imagine how many houses people just run have run out on yeah that is really sad i i know it i know it i don't think it's it's as bad now as it was a couple of years ago when everything just kind of fell apart you know everything just kind of fizzled what because when we moved down here in eighty three i mean there was buildings going up on every corner every week and yes and and the unoccupied  well i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this topic have you been talking to males yeah yeah this is this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female i was afraid we might get into an argument well uh right i guess uh there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations for uh the roles of women um-hum and uh i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now and trying to juggle right job and home and family and all sorts of other possibilities you know they may be going to school or may have elderly parents or you know all sorts of other things yeah it it seems too me like though women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore the women are spreading themselves thinner oh i think so than before absolutely i i i think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that uh we have to these days um-hum sometimes i think i am going crazy trying to do it but do you work outside the home yes do you have children uh yes they are getting older now so they are not quite as much of a responsibility but they are still there you know they still take time and uh-huh oh sure and i you know i still provide most of the the things that go on around the house right so uh yeah and for a while i was going to school to and that it was tough yeah i uh i think that while it's a good change for i think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel you know their expertise may be uh i think sometimes other things suffer and that i think it's hard to find a balance there um-hum but in some ways i think we are expected to do it all you're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things and that's where the problem is really right yeah yeah i have little children four and one and i decided that it was very important to me to stay home um and uh-huh when i i i happen to you know be i'm very active with uh people other people with children my age and most of us do tend to stay home but when i run into people that you know just have recently had had babies or have very young children and are working full time i there's almost a uh friction between us uh-huh um not people that are you know necessarily good friends even though that has happened too uh it it's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence you know when if you decide to go back to work then yeah you feel like you are always having to defend yourself and and if you don't then sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you're just wasting your time at home right yeah yeah it's a tough one i mean i've done some of both i when my kids were real little i was at home for a couple of different periods of time oh i think the longest was less than a year but still um-hum um-hum at least i was able to to spend you know those first months with them right but uh i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things you know the money was the issue yeah but uh even now i would i would like to not have to work in some ways it it's a kind of pull and tug on the other hand right yeah i can't imagine just being at home uh although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like to pursue uh-huh uh still uh there's there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having you know a job and all that goes with that no that that's definitely true in fact i i work out of my home um i'm an accountant and i do taxes and bookkeeping and oh i uh it it was it's a way for me to stay home um-hum and i mean i still unfortunately have to be very disciplined in in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night but yeah uh but but it it's worked out for for my family uh to have my cake and eat it too kind of thing yeah yeah that's a good deal where do you think this is going in the future i mean do you think things are going to change or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this well i i i hope that they will change uh but but i'm i just i know it's going to be a slow change uh i i feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner i mean i'm just thinking of my circle of people that i know i know quite a few people who have decided to not have both both uh couples you know both uh of the parents work and yet um yeah i i well i hope to see employer based you know helping out you know child uh care centers at the place of employment and and things like that that will help out um-hum what do you think do you think we're setting a trend here or i don't yeah i well i see i think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children uh and even those who may not do it seem to be um-hum spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the the family things work right uh but i don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers you know It's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are i don't know if they want to completely give that up right it is a very personal thing but it would be nice if there could be an in-between a middle ground somewhere yeah i think it's hard though when you talk about about families and and raising children because children i think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground i think they uh they need security and yet they i don't know i from speaking from my children they they aren't real flexible when it comes to things like that yeah they uh they they want to know things are going to be a certain way well yeah i think they they like a routine of sorts um-hum right well we'll see i i'm hoping to see more female leadership in in our society well yes i i like the fact that you know gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be oh yes and the the numbers are still very skewed to say the least yeah okay well i enjoyed talking to you all right good-bye okay you too Ellen bye-bye  okay okay well our involvement in our involvement in the Middle East well i don't know how you feel about uh Iraq but i think but i think we did the right thing there i think they stopped too soon though yeah i kind of feel that way too i think they should have just kept right on going into Baghdad uh probably could have struck a deal with the Saudi's and just let them have Iraq well and now the way they're uh treating those Kurds is that what they its terrible and we've just kind of backed off i don't understand that why we um yeah well i don't either and it's certainly foreseeable the Kurds have always been that way and every time they try something they they get the partner my French they get the crap kicked out of them and are they just kind of a nomad tribe type of thing yeah yeah they're scattered all over really you got them in Iran and Turkey and they sort of just meander around but they they hold true that Northern Iraq is theirs and uh i don't know it it was certainly foreseeable right after the war i mean it should have been obvious if it it was obvious to me it should have been obvious to the people in Washington there should have been some plans to try to give them some aid i mean we helped the Afghanistanis there's know reason why we shouldn't have helped the Kurds it didn't have to involve troops could have just given them uh you know supplies yeah but he's just shooting them and they just killing them off oh yeah i mean Lord there's things that we probably never will hear about that he's doing of course he's been doing it all along anyway horrible things yeah well yeah i guess he has i think they should have gotten rid of him that's that's the thing yeah i can't say i mean it's it's easy to understand why he's still there i mean those people over there have nothing i mean you can't you can't drag this guy down with nothing and the only thing that surprised me i really i really expect the army guys to get him out i really expected to have the his own people yeah i expected some of his generals and stuff to quietly do away with him assassinate him but uh it's amazing that they could stand around and watch their forces get decimated that way and not do anything about it yeah it's like he has some sort of a power over them i i can't figure it out yeah it's either that or he's well entrenched and they couldn't get to him or something but he's still running things he's still running things and they're still doing things for him and apparently still has a great deal of control see that's what i don't understand i don't either it's it's tough to understand those Middle Eastern types anyway they they think completely differently the way we from the way we do i've got several Middle Middle Eastern friends uh my my father was stationed in Iran many years ago and i was a little boy there and i have a couple of Iranian friends and i've got a couple Kuwaiti friends so you really know about them no no i don't i you don't no i know i know a little bit more than most people but no where near enough to even talk intelligently about them boy aren't you glad you're not over there or you weren't over there when all this erupted yep yes i am had have you ever gone back nope never have never wanted to how long were you over there uh we were there for four years well that's along time out of a child's life anyway yeah yeah yeah it was it was nice i enjoyed it uh Tehran was a beautiful place i still remember the house we lived in great big old it was almost something out of Ali Baba and the forty thieves you know you oh how neat yeah it was it was really nice we've got some nice uh uh Persian carpets that we still have ugh those are very nice yeah boy and you couldn't get them over hear for well you can you can but they're expensive yeah you'd have to be i went matter of fact i went to a uh Persian carpet auction about three weeks ago and i'm just amazed at some of the prices they're getting and especially now you know because you probably couldn't get anything out of there any more no not out of there but of course these things are made in uh Pakistan and India and Afghanistan and all the Iranian ones are you you know we we don't them anymore but there was loads and loads of them sent over before the embargoes and so they're still floating around oh okay yeah there's a lot there's a lot of them the Afghanistan the Afghani uh carpets are nice too i mean you can't tell the difference if you're not an expert they are all nice i mean yeah they make nice carpet and they probably they do it all by hand probably yeah they do the goods are you can tell the machine made ones but the handmade ones are very easy to spot because you have the same um you have a uh oh i forgot what they call it it's the the um what am i trying to say not the picture it's the uh way it's woved you know weived woven yeah woven how it's woven into the fabric and you know they have pattern pattern that's the word good grief it's been along day um-hum woven uh-huh um and when you turn it over you'll see that very same pattern uh it will be fainter of course but it will be that same way and the machine made ones they don't they don't look like that uh-huh it looks like our carpet where you just have a flat backing and then the thing is knitted into this backing oh okay uh they're nice though i i like them i'm still negotiating i'm trying to get a couple of them for myself your parents have them oh i don't know she yeah they they they keep they keep coming with this well when we die they're yours i i don't want to wait until your dead i mean you'll probably have it in your will that you're going to be buried with them i don't know they're yours wrapped up in their c arpet yeah just to spite us you know well uh my my my ex go go i said go ahead oh oh go ahead i was going to say my ex husband was i was talking for him last night and he was talking about going over to uh uh Iran or wherever their asking he's an electrician he's certified and he's gone to school and all that for it and they're asking for these specialized people to go over there for is a year and he was talking about going over there and i said you really want to do that um-hum i mean i think it's probably still very dangerous over there yeah i i i think it is too there's too many factions running around uh when i was in England uh a lot of uh a lot of Brit's work over in the Middle East um um-hum lots and lots of them and it it it's a it's a real financial boom for them because the the wages are tremendously high i mean they got all that money and they don't have anybody to pay it to um and it's tax free and they get free trips home twice a year things like that so they the Brit's loved it but i i'm not so sure i would want to go over there that's a little being an American you're still i mean you're still is a target over there yeah until they really and and it's not over see that's the thing it's not over and they're sending all these troops back and i think well they're probably going to end up going back over there again no not by a long shot well well you know we're not sending back as many i mean people think we're sending back a lot we're not sending back that many yet there's still a lot of them over there a lot of them a lot of airplanes a lot of ground forces well they're still shooting down planes every now and then yeah honey i uh you what we did i mean you know telling uh telling uh Saddam that well if you use your if you use your uh fighter aircraft against the Kurds we're going to shoot them down okay well wow wee you know why don't we go in there and just wipe out all their airplanes then we don't have to worry about it yeah well you know they don't need the airplanes to wipe out those people evidently they just going through and blasting them but you know from what i you know we don't hear just hear hear bits and pieces but it's pretty gruesome oh yeah yeah um-hum um-hum and probably a lot worse like you said than even know well over there in that part of world anything like this always is i mean their and it will never end they've been fighting no no they've been fighting for thousands of years and it will be they'll fight for thousands of more years it it it's going to go on forever for thousands of years um the thing that surprises me really is that Israel's sitting there in the middle of all this uh i mean i i have some bones to pick with the Israeli's but you've got to admire their tenacity to be sitting there surrounded by hostile Arabs and to maintain this is our homeland you know yeah and and they they're pretty brave a lot of people still coming in from Russia and stuff jews coming in to uh um-hum Israel i saw that on Twenty uh 20/20 or something last week you know the about the migration and it's just and and jeez i don't know what their doing with all the people yeah yeah they have i don't either well um you know they what you don't hear about is how many they turn away oh i didn't even know they were turning any away yeah oh yeah they'll help them relocate somewhere else but but they're not they're they're filling up to fast and they're they're just getting to many diverse groups there and that's something the the Jews didn't really want to happen you know they're they're stuck with the fact that you've got to take in your family your brother Jew but they're also stuck with the fact they don't want to diversify their population that much um they i mean they got a big problem with the Palestinians they don't need any other problems yeah um boy what a mess yeah i'm i'm really surprised that Israel didn't take care of Saddam a long time ago and they just didn't do anything did they they're just kind of sitting there they're sitting there it it it makes me wonder and they've they've got the capability and they've got the people you know  well Amy it's been uh kind of overcast today and cloudy we have a our i have a son in kindergarten he was having a kite day yeah oh boy and i was really worried about it raining because it its has been there been some dark clouds and it's been um and it's been pretty rainy looking yeah i've been trying to put weed spray on the lawn for the whole week and you can't put it on if it's suppose to rain within forty eight hours uh-oh and so i keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain but it really hasn't rained yeah i know it just has that i it looks several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day and not not done anything and we have a lot of trees yeah yeah in our yard and our property and they're pretty old big tall trees and so if it's an overcast day then the weather is pretty blah because i really have to some sunshine or else i feel like i live in a cave all the time um-hum yeah yeah well i get tired with the kid i have two kid preschoolers a three year old and a two year old and when it's you know not nice and they can't go out it's really the pits so i appreciate it when at lately they can at least go play in the backyard for an hour or something you know um-hum oh i bet yeah that makes a big difference but i uh we're kind of new to Plano and i'm yeah yeah working on a carnival that's going to be in a couple of weeks for our school and i'm thinking that this has been a pretty you know rainy season it's been scary it's of kind of been cloudy every day and i thought well i'm just not anxious to have worry about the weather yeah yeah well my three and half year old he really wants to have the pool out in the backyard you know so any day i mean all Winter long he's been wanting a pool in the backyard so i'm hoping you know that oh yeah it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being Winter to you know muggy and hot and it's just you never really have like nice cool sixty five or seventy degree weather with sunshine you know and i really miss that i'm from Chicago originally and i miss some miss seasons that you know that we used to get up there that you just don't have down here um-hum well i know in um i'm from Missouri and we always had pretty nice four seasons and and you know extreme we have some extreme weather in each season but um yeah i like that and we moved here from Houston in in uh July and everyone kept saying oh you're going up north it's not going to be so hot it's not going to be so humid and yeah that has just not been the case it has been oh oh really yeah it's pretty hot here during the Summer gosh oh it was extremely hot i thought i was going to die my car i thought it was going die last summer but do have air conditioning in your car or well the air conditioning was broke but broken i guess it just couldn't handle yeah the stress and the heat the record heat and you know i was worried about every time we came to an intersection that the car started idling rough you know because of the extreme heat oh yeah yeah yeah i know my husband doesn't have air conditioning in his car and he when he comes home from work you know during the Summer he's just well he feels like he's burning like he's been baking for an hour gosh um-hum oh i know that's really awful but but i uh understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year the rainy season yeah what i hate is i hate having to water so much around here you know well we never used to have to water our lawns you know in Chicago it was always enough rain here and there um-hum no sure but here if you don't water it just looks awful and i just hate to spend the money just going down the drain in watering grass you know brown yeah that is that is awful and it it takes time and the and the kids they you have to water your lawn and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy and you know so you're going do i want a dirt a green lawn or a muddy feet in the house yeah we have a dog too so that adds to it you know been tracing in and out with whatever the weather is like out there so oh no well i don't know do the nice thing i'm looking forward to is uh not having a hurricane season oh yeah because Houston was really hurricane alley wasn't it weren't there a lot of hurricanes there or yes we always had to big concern about hurricanes because we're close enough to the coast and you know you had to have a supply like uh emergency supply on hand all the time during the hurricane season and oh boy and it was pretty spooky this yeah that would be gosh they always have to think you know what's the weather doing and keep the weather radio close by and stuff like that right and do we have enough for you know um food storage and enough uh batteries and all the kinds of things yeah yeah really every time i store batteries i wind up going to use them and they're dead they've been stored so long oh boy well then this is a little bit of relief although they still have warnings all the time around here for that's right so you know tornado season hurricanes and stuff so um-hum well i yeah i don't really like tornadoes either but yeah but uh at least there isn't at least i feel like i got rid of something yeah hurricanes so not too much of that yeah well i've been worried about mostly with having little kids now with taking them out in the Summer and getting them burnt up i mean i have to keep the sun screen on them just constantly when they go outside yes because they say it's just so dangerous for little ones to get a bad sunburn and it is and i just i can't believe this the record temperatures that have were here last summer that so yeah a hundred and ten degrees and it was just unbelievably hot and i can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that i just don't even want to go out you know the house to get the mail even leave me in the air conditioning that is pretty bad we had our air conditioning broke break last last Summer the switch got something wrong with the switch and we had to call somebody out to fix it because i couldn't take it more than a few hours without it on but oh i know i can't imagine even well that would it is just pretty bad but so i guess um yeah i guess the weather hasn't changed too much from here to Houston and yeah but it is like you say coming a little bit further up north yeah yeah it's a little bit nicer to have a Spring and a Fall season where you have some pleasant weather everyday where you can feel like you just want to open your windows and no yeah that's really nice i hate having to leave the house closed you know closed up all the time um-hum yeah and get some fresh air in the house and it feels good but yeah but i guess well have you been here during the real heavy heavy rains i mean i can't remember what time of year i think it's usually t his time of year when we get some just torrential down pour gosh there was flooding our neighbors had flooding so badly it was like a foot deep in their house last year no but i remember oh no they had to replace all their carpeting and everything it was miserable now that sounds awful yeah that would not be fun no i have seen those i have driven around in the neighborhoods and seen those little flood gauges that will be there little yellow signs um-hum it's you know has it like from one foot to four foot and i thought i would never buy a house were there is a flood gauge down the street oh really oh gosh no kidding talk about asking for trouble huh yeah that would be awful yeah yeah well i've got some kids out on the trampoline i need to go look and see what they're doing okay well have a good day thanks bye-bye well you too bye-bye  hell air pollution tends to be a a topic that uh some people have a lot to say on and some don't care much for it at all but uh i found that there's there seems to be quite a bit that the individual can do as far as air pollution and one thing it kind of hits the old pocketbook a little bit but if you can just keep the automotives vehicles going properly instead of uh letting them rundown and use a quart a oil a mile like some of these smoke cars do that would uh make quite a difference we all seem to have one or more of those things and then we have a variety of people at least in this part of country that uh love their fireplaces and we burn off an awful lot of uh acreage of wood and put it up in smoke and on a proper day as far as the temperature goes you can have a cloud of smoke hovering other a neighborhood that's just sickening really i mean it may be pleasant inside but it stinks outside so uh little things like that uh an individual can do what what else do you think they can do well you know i i think fireplaces are great but you know you really don't have to have wood yeah that's true you know i mean fireplaces their great but you can get you know one hundred percent clean burning natural gas in your fireplaces and i mean you know most of the fireplaces are for ambience anyway they're not that efficient yeah that's true they they really are but but uh i live in a place where cars are are i mean you know you you you see a picture of the freeway here in the Bay area and you know at anyone given time you'll see you know maybe four out of a hundred will have more than one person in the car um so i'm i'm a real proponent for mass transit there's there's just uh uh you know there's just no reason on a regular basis for someone having you know to uh if if if we just did our mass transit better and longer and more complete you know um-hum around the Bay area here we got uh uh system here called i don't know if you've ever been to the Bay area uh it's called uh no BART Bay Area Rapid Transit and they uh um um-hum uh connect Berkeley with San Francisco with Oakland and and a couple of other cities but if it were to go to complete completely around the Bay and when you ever you get on BART BART's just absolutely wonderful because it's fast it's clean it's really efficient and it's it's actually fun to ride but uh it's just you you know it's its its been half assed and uh they need to completely uh you know um-hum make the system so it goes completely throughout the the Bay area a lot of people would ride BART but a lot more would make it right um-hum if uh and i think that alone that alone would just cut down so immensely on that we've we've also i mean the fact of the matter is is that you know they've just got to find other fuels that's true yeah and and and and go other routes our our our i think basically our air pollution is one of the one of the uh oh uh oh one of main side effects uh or or or or you know one of those visible symptoms of the US energy policy period and our energy policy is just nil just is nonexistent and uh if we had one you know striving to meet certain standards and certain goals and really to push it and uh let the corporations and the yeah you know the the automobile manufactures and stuff it it it just keeps sliding i i think it would make a big big difference it's just it you know it just hasn't hit people yet that we may have crossed the line right and that line being of of uh you know a a a a planet that's going to be able to continue to live or it's gradually already dying and it will not be renewable i mean we may have crossed that line um-hum and it will be up to our kids and maybe their kids to you know to find out right and things will live on this planet but humans may not be able to anymore right it may not be us yeah we have a um they happen to use about the same abbreviation for the Dallas area they use Dallas Area Rapid Transit for DART and uh uh DART's problem here the you know the Metroplex itself suburbs and all it it's a pretty hefty uh distance from one suburb to the southern suburb so they they run uh they gather the monies from the other counties and the other suburbs and and run the DART system throughout the suburbs to downtown Dallas as it were and it's a good forty or so miles in each direction just about and they also try to run city to city with you know around locally the only problem is for me to go to work i live um less than ten miles from the front door of my my uh place of work and for me to get there it would take me an hour and a half of three different bus transfers and that's just ridiculous can't get there from here and it's a large place i mean we're talking about oh that that that's terrible i mean that really is you know yeah Texas Instruments thirty thousand people in the whole area right and then my building inside it's fairly large and there's no reason for me to have to go from point A to point B in an hour and a half yeah when i can roll that old beast of mine down there for a lot less than that sure plus it would cost me oh i think the last time i looked at it was about had a dollar fifty one way and i said no i'm not going to do that fast isn't that bad yet yep so that part's one problem i i wonder about the whole CFC issue i've i've read some papers from some some scientist that don't get published that well because of their opposition to that saying that they're really not sure that the CFC's are the main problem yes we have a ozone problem but is it well i mean it it it is a fact uh the the CFC's do act like i mean it it it's it's like a billiard ball you get a CFC up there high enough you know it's a it's in the ozone layer um-hum it doesn't just breakdown one it's not a one to one reaction it's it's a catalytic thing and it it actually just rumbles around and around and and breaks up every C O you know O O O three molecule it hits um-hum and uh i mean well they weren't negating whether whether it is the main contributor or not it's uh you know i i think no one can doubt the fact that it is you know i mean it's it's a bad thing um-hum it's a real bad thing and it's just you know i think it's so many of these bad things some little really don't contribute that much and some just insignificantly but uh you know i i heard something the other night that absolutely floored me i'm a i'm a i'm a space enthusiast and just absolutely uh am absolutely crazy about the solar you know and think that we ought to put as much money as we can possibly get into the to the space program and i found out the other night from an Australian scientist one of the most respected uh scientist in Australia that every time i the US shuttle goes up it dumps more than what is it a hundred tons of these fluorocarbons into the ozone layer it is probably responsible our US shuttle um that's interesting breaking down the ozone layer each flight could bring it down as much as one tenth that's interesting and it's the solid rocket propellants great parts of the system if if it were to be jettisoned lower you know before it got up that high huh um-hum uh it it it it it really wouldn't have that great of effect but what happens is it goes all the way up through into the ozone layer and then it keeps firing and dumping and i just blew me away yeah that that's an awful lot yeah uh and it's frightening and and and a couple of these scientist down there have been screaming about this for some time now and of course uh Australia is the one that's going to you know suffer the most because uh that main whole that's over the uh Antarctica continent continent you know uh it it expands out over Australia and at certain times of the year right you know there's absolutely no ozone protection whatsoever in Australia in the last in the years of the shuttle the uh uh the skin cancer and and other you know uh cancers in Australia have gone up you know so mething like like six thousand percent yeah it seems like i heard that just this week on either CNN or somewhere that they they were talking about that yeah they're they're they're so they're they're a little bit cross with the US and we could remodel that system you know yeah we don't have to use those as a matter of fact it wasn't designed that way initially at all the solid uh propellant rockets were a uh you know were time saving money saving afterthought right uh and uh i just you know i think it's just been uh uh uh terrible anyway anyway but that that that that that that as an aside but there's another one of those things you know it's like so many of these little things that that that add to it that i i just think this country not only this country but the world has kind of started thinking that uh if we don't get it together here  okay what is your feeling on drug testing well uh i'm i'm for it to be honest with you i think uh that um uh honestly if you feel you have something to hide that would tend to make you be against it but if you don't really have anything to hide even though i know it is sorted of an invasion in one's privacy uh i think as a protection for me and people who do know that we're drug clean if you will that uh it's one way to uh try to uh catch those who might not be and and kinds and the kinds of problems that they can cause in the work environment or even outside the work environment i hate to think about uh the fact that uh i might have someone on the job who takes drugs and could maybe on the way home harm somebody uh if you know um running over them or something like that not even yeah not even on the way home while on the job oh yeah well that that's right i i i i haven't quite thought of that uh uh that's a very good point now limitations i i do i do think there needs to be some sort of limitations to the way you test because my wife who is a nurse tells me that there are a lot of drugs prescription drugs like that the uh medical profession can put people on and which could cause a test to show positive one point in fact uh that was not necessarily the case so it seems to me that uh even though i i personally think it's a good idea that there does need to be some some uh thought given to it some serious thought about how you can do it how you can exempt people at least the serious periods of time short or long periods of time uh um who are on prescription drugs or maybe come up with some other way of being able to test them i i don't know i i'm not in the medical profession so i wouldn't have any idea but what do you think about that well i personally think that uh it should be done also uh my feelings are the same as yours from that standpoint i spent thirty four years in education um-hum as a teacher and administrator right and uh so i saw drugs from uh the early very early fifties uh because um-hum you saw it begin to come into the schooling system absolutely coming into the uh the community more and more and uh-huh oh that's terrible the uh children being introduced to it and giving it you know to get them started on drugs they give them for nothing and uh you know and then i see um um oh yeah it's horrible the uh the problem with testing uh now they test athletes they test horses uh they test uh uh right now they test athletes for uh for steroids yes steroids right yeah and the Olympics that's always that became a common practice several years ago right and yes and so it seems to me the idea of having random and i agree with the idea of random because that way nobody ever knows for sure when it might be their time i i uh agree that uh random checks uh of uh people be it in schooling systems or on the job uh i think the text the uh the topic was suppose to be on the job yes uh uh but i i think that uh that is uh well in in this day and age if the problem ever got under control where it became no longer a problem then maybe you know you could let the rules relax somewhat but yes well now just stop and think of of um um NASA for example all the people who work for NASA are uh of course here in Dayton we have uh Wright Patterson Air Force uh uh base right here where there's so much research going on uh um-hum um-hum um-hum base uh-huh um-hum um-hum if these people uh are on drugs uh it doesn't the test results uh the results which they are uh striving for could definitely be an error or misconstrued or misread or any number of things which could mean peoples lives oh sure absolutely absolutely absolutely and and and just as any work place like you say yourself you have come from the education environment you you know yourself you don't want teachers or principles or administrators on the job yes um-hum that's right who are uh just as guilty of something that we want prevent prevent the student body from taking part in it doesn't doesn't set a good example there's also the matter of the same kinds of problems you get into in terms of handling kids uh kids that's right uh uh teaching kids uh it can cause erratic behavior it can cause all kinds of major problems it can and it does uh-huh i see well it does most most definitely does do they have any kind of random testing in the schooling system over the teachers or students no we we do not have uh we um no i spent uh the first eighteen years on in school um-hum um-hum between two schools on the west side of Dayton which was primarily black and the last fourteen years i spent um um-hum um-hum doing nothing but resolving problems with schools that were assigned to me that couldn't be resolved on a local level which could be a complaint on a principal or a teacher or uh-huh a riot a bus action stabbing taking parents to court kids to court and what have you and i was on the east end of Dayton which is primarily Appalachian um-hum um um um um um-hum um-hum and uh i could by see a tremendous difference between it but we would see uh children um taking uh a product called Toil which is Toluene which is used to clean automobiles motors and what have you i never heard of it oh Lord and they would put this in they have they'd steal a whole gallon of it and we finally found the chemical company from where they were stealing it tapping through the bottom of a a semi trailer because it's so volatile the uh companies could not keep it inside a a uh building and they would tap it from underneath drain off a gallon put a gallon in an abandoned house and the kids would go to the abandoned house wet a cloth with it put the cloth in a plastic bag and then inhale the fumes um and they they they do this like on lunchtime they come back to school and they'd have red marks all around the nose and mouth and we knew immediately what they had been doing and uh then would have to try to take appropriate action but uh you know there are a lot of things we think in terms of drugs we think of crack we think of heroin we think of marijuana we forget that there are other types of um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum of uh uh habituating drugs that are used that are just as dangerous as as the others um-hum uh-huh uh-huh so uh it's i you know it's it's it's terrible um of well don't you agree though that if you do test in a in in a company or a business or in a government agency that random testing is the right way to do it i think so uh i i see nothing wrong with that i think that that it should be uh better accepted than um uh forced testing of everyone uh-huh uh-huh uh it uh perhaps people would accept it better and then they know perhaps of a of future years down the road uh that uh uh mandatory testing if everyone everyone could uh-huh um-hum um-hum um-hum uh would come about just as small pox vaccinations were for years and some of the other types of vaccinations for syphilis and uh gonorrhea what have you right right oh yeah yeah well don't you think the government really in this case should set a good example by maybe doing it first yes absolutely and i think it should start right with our legislatures well i agree i i concur a hundred percent i really do and uh you know and uh it's not the sort of issue the people go and petition the legislatures to do uh uh unfortunately it seems to be the sort of thing that somehow or another legislatures do to pressure from the private sector who maybe having trouble yes have to eventually bring to the legislatures to get them to enact and then it final comes to government and i've always been a little disappointed that we the government sometimes don't initiate certain things like that i mean we we did back in the Kennedy time try to initiate the Civil Rights issue absolutely yes but on on on just hundreds hundreds of other issues it seems like we sort of sit back and react rather than act that's right but we but uh we we do uh legislate uh things now like uh children in the seats in car safety seats seat belts we can legislate them we can legislate say children cannot get into school without having certain immunizations to protect them you would think that we would uh you know take it another step further than the oh you mean uh yeah right um-hum we'd have uh some other kind of protection for them uh uh in for the staff the people you you know and and i understand they they fear as i'm sure your wife will tell you of AIDS um-hum oh yeah right well testing has several things that that uh come along with it it it it enables you to uh uh if you do find someone then it enables you do two things one it enables you to help them not necessarily to fire them oh absolutely it helps but but it should be given in a positive light so that you can try to help them and at the same time you can find out where they're getting the substances from it puts pressure on those who would try to push things illegal like that absolutely because they know the people that they're pushing it to if they're in a work place where they can be randomly checked when it happens then they stand a chance of being turned in and you got ways now of cutting the whole drug traffic trade because of the fact that you've got that kind of pressure right right well that that's very true and it is an immense problem and i think that that perhaps the uh money is spent in the wrong spots uh i think i i uh am very much in favor of the types of programs we're having in our schools here now with uh teaching children we have a program called uh DARE um i wish i could remember what all it stood for but it was against uh ways to uh say no to alcohol and drugs um-hum and the police departments uh in all the communities around in and around the the Dayton area have teams which go into the schools in the first second and third grades um-hum um-hum and they they talking with the children on that level and that's to me the level where you need to have it you can't wait till their already in high school because they've already tried it long before then um-hum and uh but you implant the idea that this is not what not what they need to be doing for themselves and here's how to avoid um-hum  all right well i have a lot of different teams that i like to to keep in touch with of course Texas Rangers being one of them i mean uh you know you can't live in Dallas without you know well what are the others well uh i originally came from Saint Louis so uh the Saint Louis Cardinals are one um i moved to Kansas City see i have i have a tendency to adopt adopt teams when i went go to a team uh go to a town yeah so uh i lived in Kansas City for a couple years and i adopted the Royals i lived in Houston for two and a half years so i adopted the uh well it's helpful uh the Houston Astros so i mean you know i've got quite a few well do you keep up with the statistical stuff no i don't i don't get into that too much every every once in a while i will keep in in touch with maybe like who's in the top five of hitting or something like that but i don't get into you know how many errors somebody has or things like that well there's there's a guy on that was on Norm Hisken's show that i listen to going to work in the morning who does uh uh it's essentially trivial statistics but they've got a statistic it's a statistic that has to do with winning um-hum um-hum and losing one run games i've heard of that one and apparently the Rangers last year won a lot of one run games well i didn't know that that's supposed to be a real good statistic uh well it it it is but it's the it's it's a reverse indicator well that's true they don't have the offense to uh to get out or to have the the more runs so well what the what the argument is and it it it it's one of these statistical gee how can you draw a conclusion from it but they find that that that there's a connection between that and how they do in Spring training the following year um-hum and uh it's strangely enough it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year hum which means that if you have a good year winning one run one run games that the following year you'll have a bad year and they they've got um they've looked at i think twenty three teams uh and and the uh the statistics are something like twenty one out of twenty three it was which means that the Rangers are going to have a terrible year i think which i was kind of leaning toward anyway to tell you the truth well i mean and it's uh i don't know what do you what do you think of Incaviglia's uh loss i kind of think it was necessary i mean i i i i don't i'm not a a big um pure power hitter anyway i mean i don't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time i mean uh i think that uh that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it but when you get two strikes on you you have a tendency you know you should you know shorten your swing a little bit you know if it's a perfect shot go for it but i mean you know the strike outs were a big problem for him and uh plus supposedly what i heard he was not much of a team player anyway so well it it's an interesting concept though when you look at uh of of how baseball how apparently i was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him and uh and the point of of i i guess i don't understand the the strategy of how baseball works but it seems that you know they can sign him tomorrow and he could go in the team the next day and and and they put him in the lineup and he hits a home run and all of a sudden he becomes a hero and and all he has to do is hit the ball i mean it's not um-hum yeah well that's true and and all he has to do is one you know hit it once it doesn't he can he can strike he can swing a couple times if he if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can it's an interesting uh um-hum right an interesting concept of of how they do that but i agree with you i think that i think that's part of what uh baseball needs more of i uh i i guess what bothers me is is that when you go um you wait and wait and wait and finally a guy gets up there and blast a home run and that's all the game is i'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people yeah well there's there's another point to that too they said that um that he was horrible at uh at batting with with men on base now having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you you know gives you one run obviously but i mean if you can't do it with men on base there's something definitely wrong um you know you you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs you know to to be able to yes uh score enough runs to be able win in these uh in this day and age so yeah well how do you think the Royals are going to do i think the Royals will do okay they have they have several pitchers that had badly years last year and they are they're these uh cycle pitchers they they pitch one year bad one year good one beer bad one year good Saberhagen has won uh supposedly the Cy i think he won Cy year uh two out of three years and uh you know so he's very much due for a good year well are they going to beat are they going to beat Oakland well now see that's a good question i that's i don't know how Oakland's going to react to being uh swept in the World Series last year they could very easily uh take that as a challenge which is the way most teams naturally you know naturally do uh and and just go out and and not give anybody a chance to beat them so yeah well i go to Saint Louis from time to time and i watch i i watch their sports up there and they're uh they're they're certainly intense about the Cardinals they um-hum oh yeah baseball is there is there life up there like football is down here i think you did you actually live in Saint Louis i lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis yeah yeah everybody does right yeah that's true too i think that's all that they have i had a friend from college that lives in uh yeah it's well i should say on the west side i mean everything's on the west side Manchester um-hum uh out that way and uh went and visited him but anyway it is interesting well how are the Cardinals do you still keep up with them or something hum yeah oh yeah i i definitely do in fact i've got family that still lives up there um from what i hear from everybody up there they're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go but i've been following Spring training and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far so well is that a good indicator that well it can be it it really kind of depends on on um what they were you know what they were looking for in other words if if in Spring crain training they were looking at all their kids like a lot of them do um then it really doesn't give you any indication but if they were uh playing the people that they're going to play then that might be pretty good indication so you know it's it's it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just you know come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring craning training and then gone on a you know fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season so you know what i think's remarkable is uh it seems that what you really need to do to win though is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have have have really breakthrough years exactly yeah and and the question is how do you forecast that if you had to you know if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series i mean it'd be really tough you can't right the i think the best thing that you can do is go with um the players that are that have the talent to do the best years and um that they hadn't had these uh gigantic uh career years yet and and just kind of assume that you know someone one of them is going to break through eventually so and i i think they said the Reds um this last year i'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years yeah yeah you know and and so they may be even better better this year well well when are the Rangers going to come through with it uh that's a good question i the Rangers have a have a pitching problem and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question they're doing the right thing though uh they are going with their farm system they're letting their farm system uh build up and stuff like that and well is there enough money that's part of it i oh oh that was part of Skip Bayless argument i don't know if you read Skip Bayless but a a a local commentary and um-hum no um-hum his argument is that uh the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to to bring in the big dollars um that's probably true well conside ring what i've seen in the last uh you know two seasons i'm beginning to agree with that yeah but i mean you don't have to spend the big money as far as i'm concerned to uh would you would you agree with that to win you just have to spend it if it's necessary in other words if you've got a player on your team who's helping your team then keep him there don't let him go away you know and i think that's really what's been hurting uh uh the uh Rangers uh yeah well didn't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their pitching staff oh yeah they they spent more money last year than any other team in the in the league and they were you know toward the bottom of the league uh so it's like i said spending money doesn't guarantee you uh winning a pennant it really doesn't so yeah well and that i think that's maybe part of it that that the um and it you know if i owned the team i think you'd like them to do well but the question of losing big big money that what didn't didn't did Steinbrenner actually make money on the uh you got me i you know i think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go and once you do that you lose everything i mean well it it it yeah it's it's a little bit like any other sport you know when it starts costing you fifty to a hundred dollars to go to a game um-hum and uh you know i mean i i guess as we get older if you're probably going if if you if you compare to go to a a sport a a say you go to a rock concert or or even a performance uh um-hum an opera or the symphony or something uh if you know it but how how often do you do that and i i would i would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there you know several times a right that that's the whole point there're so many games in in a year that they've got to have repeat customers they can't afford not to and yeah you know that's one of the things that i think Saint Louis has done um i mean their you know their ticket prices are you know kind i guess as high as anybody else's but what somehow or another they attract uh so many people from some i mean they're a some it's a small market and yet they attract as many if not more than most uh uh most other cities so yeah but don't you think there's a the the there're older fans there i don't i don't mean older um you know the fact that that it's it's a better established and that the the city is is is more of a of a  okay we're gonna talk about the public school system what's wrong with it and or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it what should be done about it okay fantastic one one thing that pops into my mind real quick is uh about the uh funding of the the school system right now evidently uh that's that's a big problem yeah yeah it's amazing um i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough i mean to be doing what they're doing right uh when i was in college i like i enjoyed teaching because i did some teaching part-time and i really enjoyed that but i wouldn't wanna go teach high school or junior high it just you know too many problems oh Lord i mean yeah and you talk about stress and pressure i tell you what it's uh yeah they're putting in fifty sixty hours a week i'm sure because they got to grade papers and get class stuff ready and you know and they're being paid probably half what most people being paid do right exactly and uh hey we're paying basketball people you know millions of dollars a year for for what you know that's right and then they uh poof it off you know just like Tarpley but um yeah i don't know it what gets me is i can't believe that Congress um or our state legislature can't come up with uh some kind of workable means to have funds for the school you know it's uh i just don't understand that yeah it's uh i don't do you have little kids or what no uh sure don't my wife and i have just been married about two years but i have a sister that's a uh school teacher and uh yeah yeah my wife and i have a a three year old almost four and a and a two year old so we're looking at uh the older one going to school next year not not well not this coming fall but the year after that and the year okay okay so it's getting close yeah he's gonna be going to kindergarten so so you know we're we're thinking about that what that what that gonna be like are they gonna be taught nothing are they gonna be taught something we're gonna we're gonna be involved in our child's education we're gonna be teaching him what we can at home of course right right because uh i guess we don't trust the school systems which is really sad um but but it if it doesn't start at home it's not gonna go anywhere exactly right that's true uh and we're gonna try to teach him good values because you know when when when they get to upper level school and they start teaching well hey if you can play football or basketball that's what's important not if you can read or write or do or understand understand some science you know i mean give me a break that's that's that's bogus exactly right right well and uh you know one thing my wife and i've talked about it are uh private schools yeah you know whether uh uh we would want to invest in in private schools as they're growing growing up because you know just in the Dallas area um we're not real comfortable with the with the public schools and Dallas uh school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling i couldn't believe that right right you know the one that's one reason we bought a house here in Plano we were hoping you know well the school district's gonna be good you know for resale value and so on and so forth but yes um i can definitely uh see on down the road you know when we do have kids and are getting to that age that's gonna be a definite concern yeah we talked you talked about before about uh the school funding i think there's only gonna be one solution to school funding which i i don't think will be necessarily the best way but i think what's what's gonna have to happen is there's gonna have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids that's the only way they're gonna fund it because they start raising taxes for property and people are gonna throw a fit that's yeah and you know that's taxes is right now are political suicide you know and i don't think any politician's gonna do that so oh yeah yeah and the only thing they they would would think of would be tuition you know if it works at colleges it'll work down below and you know that's gonna that's gonna affect the people that are having kids in school of course which is probably the only fair thing to do right but it'll be hard for those that people have have in school because they have to pay out even more exactly and you know it's gonna really hurt the the middle class uh people i think because uh they're the ones that'll probably have to uh uh carry the brunt of the load oh yeah that's right so uh and most the problems with kids in school carrying guns and and knives and everything i mean good grief what's with yeah now that's that's just unbelievable to me you know i can't believe that i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened you never heard about that well yeah we didn't we didn't even think about it you know no and now you know what we have now you know got kids that Rusty because he like you know a a Magnum gun in school like good grief right i mean i would i'd be afraid to be in school i mean be teaching or even a being a student and think what's what's it gonna be like for my my youngest and my oldest son when he goes to school what what's gonna happen i mean i i'm afraid for him to go but on the other hand you can't hold them back exactly right well no and you and you wanna encourage them you know to to be active and everything in school but uh you know with all the peer pressure that's going on with all the negative things it is uh it's a tough environment to be growing up in yeah a lot tougher from it was when i was going to school and that was when i was i graduated high school in nineteen seventy nine so that was what twelve years ago i guess okay right so you know it's a lot different now and what's it gonna be like in another twelve years when my uh oldest son's in high school that's right that's right i'm afraid to i'm afraid to even think about it no yeah that is a scary thought but uh i don't know i i guess what you have to do is just uh keep encouraging uh you know encouraging them and and uh uh try to be open with them so that you can deal with the problems as they come up yeah and that's all you can do you got to you got to be your child's best friend i guess even when they're a teenager and they you know are kind of standoffish still you got to be their best friend because when they got problems who they gonna go to their friends that are dealing drugs or or there parents right exactly you know and and if they go to their friends dealing drugs they're gonna be in even worse shape that's right and and the schools don't don't really encourage to stay away from that you know the schools are there teach history and that we fought the civil war etcetera etcetera they don't teach them good values like drugs are bad i don't maybe i'm wrong maybe because i haven't you know been in that kind of environment for a long time but it just is amazing you know need to teach them good values right that's true that's true and uh of course what what if if i say this is a good value someone else is gonna stand up and say oh no and the ACLU's gonna get after them and have a lawsuit which is gonna take twenty years to resolve you know right well and i think uh you touched on it you know you've got to start them at the home yeah you know that's where they that's where they get the the deep-rooted values and and uh and that's about right then you just have to hope and pray that that everything uh works out works out okay that that's all you can do that's right well i got to be going so uh well okay well hey i appreciate the call you too bye-bye nice talking to you Jay hm have a good life uh  family reunions no you just just talk does this give us the signal i guess not okay um we have family reunions about every year with my husband's family uh-huh and generally it's held in the summer and we have it in the state park which has worked out pretty well uh over by Clifton Forge huh which state park huh uh Delford have you ever heard of that no but it's in Virginia oh well it's bound to be beautiful right uh-huh well it's pretty good yeah uh there quite a few children in the family so we have to yeah yeah yeah try to find a time when everybody can be there and we've right been pretty lucky so far yes that that sounds wonderful i we uh we have family reunions not on a regular basis and there's mostly in my wife's family uh my family's very small uh-huh um it's essentially the four of us makes up my family but um when we do get together and and the two families do get together it's usually a wedding or or uh or a uh anniversary uh my wife's uh grandparents are still living and on one side both both are living and on the other side the grandmother is still living so um we do uh occasional get together usually in New Hampshire uh-huh oh at my uh my uh mother-in-law's house and uh where in New Hampshire uh at North Hampton right North Hampton uh-huh i'm from Maine originally i'm sorry i said i'm from Maine originally i'm not i'm a maniac in other words oh really yeah oh we lived in uh we lived in uh New Hampshire for ten years we lived in Dover uh until we moved out here oh uh-huh so uh yeah and i don't know do you do anything special to make it interesting well uh well uh we're we're some of the older ones in the family so the ones with small kids usually have ball games and kick ball things like that oh right yeah uh one of them has made big banners to put on the oh we have one of those isn't that awful shelter a covered shelter and they've had big banners to display across the front of that oh yeah uh-huh right right and it's always a potluck everybody brings food yeah yeah seems to me well the the the uh main event of course is the meal at the end uh right everybody has a specialty and so uh it's sort of it's it's sort of a high class potluck i guess you could say and uh it's wonderful it's uh uh i mean ah get all those good family favorites right i mean and and if somebody didn't make the usually thing they'd be you know everybody else would get all upset you know so if you try something new right and try something new it's not it's not acceptable drum them out of the family uh-huh and uh and then afterwards uh usually uh there's a gathering in the family room to watch a football game or something oh i see so uh and uh and the kids are usually uh playing out in the back she's got uh ten acres of property that go with uh with her house so there's plenty of room for the kids to go crazy and and the parents can oh that's great oh yeah that's great what time of year do you you have it in the fall like after yeah at football games it is it's wonderful uh my next family reunion with my family will be it tends to be in the fall yeah that's that's a beautiful time in New Hampshire yeah a wedding in Atlanta this month so we're looking forward to that yeah oh that will be nice yeah do you have a feel for how many people there are when you get together uh it will be quite a few because one brother has five children and they're all going to be there with their children whoa oh gee well let's see i i don't think i could put a number on it uh i know that uh we have three kids and um my wife has uh two other sisters and one of her sisters has um two kids and then her brother has two kids going on three so there's there's plenty of plenty of that and then her stepfather has uh a daughter and a son and the son has two two children golly so that's pretty that's pretty good yeah a lot of kids kids and the cousins really get along with each other they're all young they're all i yeah uh-huh do they do you organize things or get or do they just no i they're pretty good at it my daughter i guess is the oldest she's ten and uh she is really good at that you know that kind of thing getting everybody together to play games and stuff so they i mean they don't need much uh right they just have a good time probably you know much direction in that area and and then of course Grandma always seems to provide a a lot of things to a lot of toys and things yeah there's a lot of stuff just there to to let your imagination go wild with you know of course the new thing is the Nintendo a lot of things to do huh uh-huh right and uh all the kids seem to enjoy that we we will have an Nintendo somebody have will bring an Nintendo right i well my my i know my sister-in-law who uh is uh engaged to be married uh-huh always bring one huh yeah her husband's an Nintendo uh are her boyfriend i guess her fiance hard to keep track these days um is an Nintendo freak so he'll he'll have a he'll he'll usually bring a few games uh-huh um oh then we always video tape oh uh-huh so we always have the gang on tape and we see how they grow each year yeah yeah that's a lot of fun yeah that's interesting because that's a good idea yeah that's a lot lot there will be times when we'll turn that on instead of instead of watching something on TV uh-huh is her family in Texas no her family is in New Hampshire and in New York and in uh in uh oh in in North Carolina uh-huh oh and one of them is living in Rhode Island now they're all in the northeast part of the country my family's in Virginia and then we're living in Texas oh yeah right well i have two girls and one is in Texas and she's a TI uh employee right now and uh the other one is in New Mexico uh-huh new Mexico wow that's we've seen just a little bit of New Mexico we haven't really traveled that much since we've been here uh but we've seen a little bit of New Mexico and that was very nice and Colorado seemed very nice right uh-huh Colorado is beautiful but everything in between was wasn't very interesting that's kind of what we found she's uh in the northern part of New Mexico it's pretty it's up in the mountains yeah it's beautiful oh yeah up in the mountains yeah that's that's what we miss we miss mountains and trees uh-huh of course you have plenty of uh plenty of uh mountains in Virginia and then in northern and you know up in New Hampshire and Maine too we had uh one of the um right right yeah times that we had sort of a family reunion was when uh was this i think it was last last winter we uh we went up to New Hampshire to go skiing oh great and uh a bunch of us got together it wasn't the whole family it wasn't all the all the uh cousins usually when when we make a trip uh-huh out there somebody else flies in or something because uh my wife's family all have well they have a lot of connections with the airlines my oh i have a brother-in-law who is a pilot my father-in-law is a pilot um and so that makes it great doesn't it yeah a lot of mobile people so the so the uh sister-in-law who lives in North Carolina can usually get up and uh uh-huh but uh and then so we're when we're in New Hampshire everybody else is in that area anyway and usually somebody will drive in from New York so uh it's usually some kind of uh semi reunion right well we go to Maine every fall i have a brother who lives there still and i have a sister-in-law and nieces and nephews so we always have a family family reunion up in Farmington oh yeah and it's usually out on a farm one of the girls has a farm and oh oh gee homesick um have you heard about these uh these businesses these companies that uh i mean their business is planning family reunions for people oh yeah that's i i thought about this and uh it seems like a pretty neat no i haven't huh-uh thing they do uh family reunions and they do um oh what do you call it um oh class reunions oh and they make all the plans they contact everybody and they make sure everybody's got travel arrangements and uh uh-huh and uh i guess it's in fact i think it was started by somebody who was a travel agent and they got this brainstorm that you know they could make a living oh by arranging for different family reunions and class reunions all over the country yeah i always thought that would be kind of might be kind of fun you know especially with a class reunion where uh-huh that's pretty interesting yeah you have to do a little research try to find everybody i guess it's a little easier with a family reunion and they you know and they they're really organized you know they setup they they get the hall and they and they uh right uh-huh yeah uh-huh uh arrange for the catering and they have name tags  hi i don't know much about this topic let me ask you does she spell her name with two Ns and an E uh no she doesn't okay oh okay well then we're all right okay that would have been totally weird yeah i have no idea who listens to this oh yeah that's right well we'll find out later they've got this all reported i guess there you go yeah oh right i didn't know there was a proposal to serve young people to have a year of public service actually i didn't either um uh i really wasn't familiar with that and um i didn't even realize i had put that as you know this must be something fairly new because i don't remember this as even being one of the topics you know had to put have be discussed yeah i didn't i didn't either are you from Pennsylvania yes are you from Pittsburgh oh God close Johnstown ha we're not suppose to do this i i can i'm from originally from Beaver County oh my God oh your kidding no i could smell an accent a mile away oh isn't that fun only people from there can tell everyone else is where did you get that weird accent are you in Pennsylvania or Dallas right now uh no right now i'm in uh Washington DC area oh okay and you're in Dallas yes i'm in Dallas my husband's a TIer okay oh okay well my yeah actually my husband he's with the uh he's with the federal government and uh i'm a civil engineer but i'm taking a year off are you my oh how nice um what uh how do you feel about uh the the young people are they are are they talking uh do you think eighteen years of age like right or during high school i don't know i'd first of all is there a proposal in this i mean is there a legitimate proposal i didn't see that on the list but i guess it's unless yeah i've never heard of such of thing this is this is really a surprise to me i wasn't total i'm glad it was you because i was afraid i'd get some guy on here that knows all about this yeah really i guess i would say that if there is one i would think that they are talking eighteen years or twenty one years of age uh-huh but i personally don't think it's a good idea for a year i would look at it more as a uh internship kind of thing maybe three months through you know ninety days to six months or something um but more than that i would have a problem with it uh-huh yes and and how do how do you think that they would propose to do is far as if uh a person is coming out of high school and going to college how could you know i wonder how they could possibly enforcement uh if this would be a voluntary thing or a mandatory yeah the way the the way the voice might have worded it it sounded almost mandatory as opposed to elected and i would obviously i mean not obviously but i would be against anything like that being mandatory yes it did yeah well i think i would also and i think it it really uh would be very difficult in terms of uh you know people i'm thinking mainly people going to college i don't see how right how with uh the work load kids have nowadays and what often most college students i'm like maybe when we went to school i don't know how long ago you went but thirty something yeah me too and and uh you know i think it it's it's most of them now carry part-time jobs on top of having fifteen or sixteen credits there you go yeah that and thus think i mean i don't know i went to uh even though i'm from that part of the country i did go to high school in uh the Midwest and Chicago and i we had it was mandatory that we took civics every year yeah oh really yeah it was a mandatory and then you had to take a test that showed you had a certain knowledge of state government and state service and they did offer actually certain types of public service internships that i think is a very good idea that that's mandatory yeah i see yeah but i don't know how any i mean the whole thing sounds a little bit ludicrous but that's my word yeah the other thing i think that they could do possibly is with um i don't know when i went to school we had um in our social studies we had it divided into for every report card period like there were five or six six week sessions and we could pick what we wanted uh-huh right to take you know whether you wanted to study American Indians or this or that maybe as one of those six week sessions instead of having a class um or have the class but as part of that or part of the credit would be to do something like that on a voluntary basis and when they're younger not when they're getting into undergraduate and college age yeah yeah i i uh i really i'm bewildered as far as how they could even work something like this in if they try to make it mandatory i don't yeah and i maybe that's not what they meant maybe that's just the way both of us took the wording but i i think it's a good i get idea to get younger people involved in the government in some way or the public you know happenings it's just they they're not aware of why things cost what they do why things operate the way they do but i just right right and in this area there's so much going on volunteer wise like for home life uh i you know i know it's for you mean in the in the area of geographic region you're in uh-huh yeah yeah there there are many organizations uh feed the hungry all these there's a lot of drives in school for this type of thing already you know not neccessarily sometimes um grass roots effort they might even have i know uh with a niece and nephew of mine they're school was uh like uh church school and they even had things where they would have them go to shelters downtown and help for a day uh-huh huh oh my or um what a lot of kids do here is um they have things to school where they have actual they have a holiday game night but every your uh your uh fee if you want to call it or the way you get admitted to going to this show is to uh-huh uh-huh bring a can or two for the hungry oh yeah they do that i mean in in in north Texas they do that quite a bit where you know if you want to go to this particular movie or concert or a discounted thing the big thing down here is rodeos uh if you uh-huh oh yeah that's quite different from up here i guess yes yeah really i'm i'm bite my lip i'm not going to talk Pennsylvania it's just listening to you i just talked to my brother it's like really weird coincidence yeah uh um i really don't think they can do it though i mean i i you know i think that things that your talking about like anything that emphasizes the social services yeah that is this yeah that is pretty wild that is pretty wild yeah with the public service i right right or yeah i think they can integrate maybe a short period of time in with high school students and get them to be aware that you know they're not uh especially teenagers they're not the only ones around and what maybe their uh-huh you know their parents are going through especially i know in an area like this it's uh fairly affluent and and kids here are really out of touch with reality i always call it Disneyland here are they even are you are you in northern Virginia or are you in the District of Columbia uh we're in no we're in uh where they call it now north Potomac it's it's a town but it's close to Potomac yeah okay and um you know you see sixteen year olds driving around in brand new BMWs and it's just unbelievable you know yeah that's we're in a yeah that's we're in a near next to a town called Plano Texas and it's very um it's like Falls Church Alexander i mean Montgomery County i'm familiar with where you're at um and they really that's a good way to put it i know right yeah i went to high school in the city of Chicago at an inner city school although i lived in a different area near a place called Evanston Illinois uh-huh uh-huh and the reason that i stayed at the school i did was because at Evanston township which back then was like one of the three larger schools in the country yes everybody was already doing the um driving the beamers and you know with nothing to think that um they didn't have five hundred dollar wardrobes you know every week that kind of thing yeah yeah yeah i i just i just think the one thing they do so strongly about is what your saying that i don't think kids have a sense of civic responsibility no they don't i think then that's a step away from even duty i don't think they even have a sense of the responsibility right and i think one other area here is that um this is typically what we call in this area yuppie area and people aren't my kids you know other than you know occasionally they're not even aware that there are people over fifty that uh-huh exist you know and and i think it might be another good public service might be to have them help out in geriatric homes or you know this type of thing they are around uh this is true yeah yeah i think the one thing the the there's a program called uh Habitat For Humanity that Jimmy Carter started the former president and i think i think programs like that with what you just talked about going on in your area local area at and something like that would be good uh-huh uh-huh yeah you know but not that specifically but things along that of of activity right and i i in general i feel that um i don't know what this still proposes far as what age or or how they would do this but i feel that reaching the kids when they're younger is better though i think once they're out of high school they're so into their own thing that i think it would be very difficult maybe by that time they're too uh calloused to what is even going on you know where as younger children it's the it's the grade school children when there say no to drugs and that type of thing in school formed yeah they're already right they're the ones that'll come home and tell you you know you shouldn't smoke it's bad for you shouldn't drink it's bad for you uh-huh and i think it's the younger it's the younger uh kids that it reaches more and so if they want to start this type of thing it should be integrated maybe from a young age and and uh-huh yeah i agree with you like pre junior high and and um see and make it you know a curriculum oriented type of proposal as opposed to anything mandated like the old selective service or anything so it sounds like we're in agreement with that yes right right yeah i think so uh anything any else we can we can talk about i don't know i guess that's it say hi to Pittsburgh if you're talk about Pittsburgh yeah your right it's like i mean this is very strange because i'm not in that part of the country i don't care if they listen i'm not in that part of the country i don't want to offend you i and i'm not in their part of the country so what i hear all my best friends are in western Pennsylvania and it's like oh yeah yeah you miss yeah i don't know if you miss it or not but yeah i i do i mean i didn't grow up totally there because of a parent parental divorce in my family but um you know it was always shuttle back and forth so uh it's like two homes but yeah i miss it uh-huh yeah well this is a good area because you're far enough away and yet you're close you know so holidays and things or whatever you wanted to you can be there but yeah um you know i enjoy being here i don't know if i'd ever you know i might go back there eventually one day it's a depressed area uh right now you know yeah really is they've cleaned it up a lot though i mean i don't think we'll get in trouble doing that oh yeah oh Pittsburgh i lived there four years i i liked when i was a teenager and early twenties and i liked it there a lot people didn't but i really enjoyed it yeah i lived there in my early twenties too before i moved oh that's the that's weird i hope we never met  well do you own a PC no i don't i have one at uh the company i work for furnishes so i can work at home oh wow and it's just an old old compact that is super slow and but it does it does it's job so what processor does it have in it um i don't know it's so old oh what kind of work do you do on it it's one of um i do um television ratings and i process some ratings and put do graphics for their television stations those are their clients so oh okay yeah it's basically just data entry and running you know some some software so it doesn't really have to be anything sophisticated you know huh yeah i don't own a PC but i've i've yeah i work for TI and uh they so yeah my husband does too so well i have uh pretty fairly a fairly fancy one it's a TI model it's an S P one thousand which has a it has a fast processor in it a three eighty six uh-huh and i the the job that i do i do a lot of training of our customers for new products uh-huh and i have to develop uh functional specs and desk and desk top publishing and everything so it's uh-huh yeah it's kind of fun i mean i i i always say that i need to buy a computer for the house but i just haven't got around to doing it yet oh yeah i'd like to have one for the house too but sometimes my husband my husband says usually i work on the computer all day at work i don't want to come home and have to work on one too your husband what what group is your husband in um something with the defense uh oh DSEG defense systems and electronics group yeah something like that yeah they've changed their name so many times i've lost track so i see yeah he works up in Plano oh okay yeah i work on uh printers and the peripheral products division basically uh-huh uh i work in the airline marketing marketing group oh so we we do a lot of i didn't even know they had anything like that oh yeah man there's so they're i learned so many things that they they do they're into so many different things so yeah i just kind of in for a while you know he had a he had uh one of those what are they top secret things you know where he couldn't talk about what he did so uh-huh yeah for a while but then he switched jobs i don't understand half the stuff he does and i have uh is he a programmer uh-huh software design engineer so as i see they call it so but i have a degree in information management uh-huh which is computer you know right it's basically the more the business business end of it than the programming end of it you know right so but i've been at it for you know five years so everything's changed so much i probably couldn't even get a job right now it seems like it's changed so much so you know they've made such advances in computers so really so uh does your husband ever use uh a laptop or a notebook does he bring a little one home with him or no huh-uh sometimes he brings he brought home a uh a portable one uh-huh but uh it it quit working so he brought it brought it back and he just hasn't brought another one home but they did give him a new computer at work so oh i see yeah we we build uh laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also oh uh-huh and those are really handy i mean we they they have modems in them you can send a fax from your PC oh how nice no he doesn't have one of those so but they're they're really what's that he doesn't have one of those yeah they're they're pretty handy because you know when i travel it's easy to check messages just you know uh-huh plug in the phone to your computer and dial in and yeah well my husband doesn't have to travel so oh okay yeah i just found out i'm going to Denver Sunday night again oh boy so that kind of reeks havoc with plans well at least you get to but it it's really not enough to become a big hassle uh-huh well that's good some people enjoy the travel but i don't think i'd like it if he traveled a lot so i see yeah i would love to have a computer they but they're so expensive well i don't know there you can get well depends on what you consider expensive i mean you can get real high powered stuff now uh-huh for under two thousand dollars where you know just a few years ago it would have been six seven eight nine thousand dollars yeah yeah guess it's not it's all you know it's inexpensive compared to what it used to be but it's a lot to put into one yeah it's still i mean you know two thousand dollars isn't just just pocket change to a lot of people that's right no it's not it's it's not pocket change so it's major so but maybe when the kids get in school that will be you know when they start needing something you know then that will be different but yeah when i started at uh TI i was a summer development student uh-huh and finishing up at school and so those papers really i mean it was nice having access to the oh yeah equipment to uh yes i remember that i had to do some of my husband's papers because i had access to one but you know he his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing you know so yeah i did a lot of his papers yeah they come in real handy that was a lifesaver well how many different types of packages do you use at home uh-huh um all i the packages i i don't really use them i pictures is what i use that's the only um outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been written in house that i use oh okay yeah golly i've got up up at work anyway i use uh WordPerfect and Lotus and yeah i know those two i worked GemDraw which is a uh uh a a line draw package uh-huh i've just used WordPerfect and Lotus yeah you probably use D base or something like that for your uh data entry stuff that your talking about um the most yeah yeah a lot of the data entr y stuff they used uh survey system and and um you know just in-house programs to do what they needed i work do you get to do you work at home all the time or just well no i worked for this company before i had my first daughter uh-huh and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things so oh that that was that worked out pretty good then yeah it did you know i don't do i don't really don't do basic a lot of what i used to do i just do you know something really minor but uh-huh it's something that nobody else wants to do yeah and it's time consuming so so it keeps you in the company huh that's right you know it gives me a paycheck you know it's only like the works only you know three weeks goes for like three to four weeks three times a year uh-huh you know it's not something that's continual because you know the television ratings don't come out you know all the time they only come out four times a year so yeah but boy i tell you if i could bring a computer home and do stuff here i'd get all kinds of stuff done phone's always ringing and oh uh-huh people always asking me to do something else yeah i've got a lot of especially right now we've got several new products coming out and i've got lots of documentation i need to review and some i need to revise uh-huh will they let you take a computer home to work well yeah but you know i need to be at the office too you know i've just got to deal with all those other things that happen but oh uh-huh a PC at the house would really take a lot of the load off yeah yeah i bet yeah my husband he took one home when they when they had it you know they had a big deadline coming up and it was looking a little touchy to meet so uh-huh well i've i've done that before on a couple times but that would make it just that much easier instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home a few floppy disks you know yeah uh-huh that's right i thought that would be you know because it's real nice with this because i don't even have to go into the office i've maybe been into the office once in the past three years you know oh my they just um they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever so you know man that sounds really nice yeah it is real nice you know i just deal with them on the telephone half the people don't even know who they're talking to uh-huh but i you know worked i know most of them well i can't say that a lot of people changed around there but most people know who i am but i don't know who they are you know uh-huh a lot of them just know me by name and phone voice right yeah i've got a lot of folks that i've worked with like that as well yeah you just know them by the telephone so but well it's been good talking to you i think we've just got the subject yeah we sort of stayed to the topic anyway yeah we tried it's hard to sometimes okay well thanks bye bye okay well we'll talk to you later bye  okay okay that made a nice ugly sound yeah your name is Lynn Linda okay so Linda uh-huh so it sounds like you like to read yeah i i read quite a bit i probably don't read as much as i would like to i don't read as much as i would like to either i'm i'm a single mom but i i've always loved reading what do you like to read uh-huh um well um i'm a i'm a counselor a therapist by trade so most of my books are um i guess what you'd call self-improvement type of books oh well that's what i've been reading lately a lot of um my interests switch around dramatically i used to read just mainly fiction fiction and now i like like a said i've read a lot of self self help books uh-huh what kind of things have you read oh i read all kinds of things for um helping people uh survive a divorce uh The Road Less Traveled was probably one of my favorites have you read that um-hum um-hum i i haven't gotten through it yet you haven't no okay well what would you recommend um as as far as dealing with divorce oh i'm i'm kind of getting that one past me but a good self help book good self help well um probably the best one that i i know of and i work with all the time is called Search for Significance yeah um that sounds good it's by Robert Magee and it's one that that we use in our work uh it's probably one you'd find in in like a Christian book store um uh-huh i don't know what the chains are down there maybe in the mall family book store something like that uh-huh i'm writing it down that does sound that's sound really good um what kind of counseling do you do or should we stay on the topic of books um probably should stay on the topic but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that i read i um um-hum a therapist for Rossa it's a Christian treatment organization oh and because of that i see i work with adolescents specifically so i i see a lot of kids with with various problems right now some of the things i'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse so a lot of the books i've been reading uh have to do with with helping them get through uh those issues oh i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves they're at a bad stage anyway and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible as a teen um-hum that's uh boy uh that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that well sometimes it's rewarding and and sometimes it's a struggle oh i'm sure i'm sure um what other is is that just the only type of reading you've been doing or do you have you read any good novels lately um i guess i i've got so many books like that that i need to read it's it's hard for me to do a lot of uh reading yeah reading just for enjoyment just joy reading yeah i i i hear you there that's for sure in fact um i guess the last book book i've read um my oldest daughter uh-huh uh had to read Lost Horizons for her English class and i just realized i had never read it growing up so i just finished reading that for enjoyment um-hum hum that's neat and it was it was good um she she's not didn't enjoy it much so i didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her but uh i thought it was real interesting yeah i've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um because i enjoyed some of those stories so much but i never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading um-hum um-hum i know yeah um i'm trying to think of some of my other favorite books but uh i i keep lists i must have a list of oh two hundred three hundred books that i want to read it just like oh i want to read that and i write it down oh uh-huh yeah i've got a a stack next to my bed i i tend to get a a little bit of ways in a book and then i i get distracted and or have to start on another one and so do i it's pretty tough to keep up with i was trying to think of of of i've got a copy of The Road Less Traveled but i was trying to think there's another Scott Pack book that i've got that i had read so i was uh he he also wrote People of the Lie and yeah that's the one i was thinking of yeah i i bought that one and i didn't get into involved in that one as well there's another one he wrote that even sounds better and it's kind of uh the whole concept of global peace you know it's like and communities building communities and uh um-hum someone just recently said something really neat about that uh i got involved in uh Beginning Experience Weekends and uh it was one of the people from there that uh that said that his latest book and i don't can't recall the name of it is just excellent and his whole idea is we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects and he did uh mention Beginning Experience Weekends as one of the you know one of the places so i have um hum that's interesting yeah it it really was a a a real fun books bunch of books that i read uh the beginning of last year were um the author of Jonathan Jonathan Livingston Seagull Seagull i can't think of his name right now pardon me um-hum is it Swift Swift uh no uh oh it'll it'll come to me but he wrote he wrote the Illusions the Illusions Illusions and A Bridge Over Time uh uh-huh A Bridge to Forever those are really really mind expanding books his concepts are so different than what i would have ever dreamed of hum i can't think of what his name is right right off the bat though but uh they they they were fun they were real just books for fun um-hum have you been involved on the switchboard long um not very long i i really just started uh-huh how did you get involved my wife has been working for TI oh i see i'm a former uh a former TI'er i just recently quit and so uh i got myself involved in a sales job and right now uh my list of books to be read have to do with uh the art of selling so oh uh-huh yeah i was just i was just thinking at at Rossa they they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks uh-huh just to help us deal with with all the things that we have to deal with so i keep getting stacks of books i need to read and i don't know when i'm going to get to them all there's never there's never going to be enough hours in the day even if you took speed reading huh yeah i don't think so yeah i don't think so so well i'm trying to think of what other kind have do you like to read mysteries yeah a little bit have do you like Ken Follett um trying to think he he writes uh spy novels The Eye of the Needle and uh i i've really i've really have found his books en joyable uh-huh well i like that kind of stuff i think the last novel i read i read in i guess in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year it was a um his last name's Peretti it's called Piercing no it's called This Present Darkness um it's uh it's kind of unusual book it's a lot about uh spiritual warfare and some things like that oh that sounds interesting it sounds really good hey you should make yourself a promise that you'll you'll read one novel in the next six months just just for you you know um-hum it's it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work or you know self improvement and you kind of forget the fun of reading yeah that's true yeah very easily so well i guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly i think so too oh well thank you for calling and uh i'll have to check out that book you told me about okay thank you you take care bye-bye yeah it was nice talking to you Linda okay great hope hope you like it um-hum you too bye-bye  so uh describe your family budget well i've uh for a lot of years i i've pretty much flied without one and uh just recently uh we we set up a budget and and we're trying to stick to it we just bought a new house so we've got everything you know pretty much we know what our uh our fixed expenses are per month and then we've got some ones that are variable that that pretty much stay within a certain range and then uh then there's the ones that you never know anything about and that's the the food budget but that well yeah and to some extent uh utilities i imagine yeah well the utilities they're pretty much uh uh you can pretty much uh figure what they're going to be and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you uh they have that to some extent here but it's not quite as good and um-hum uh transportation expenses i guess you own a car yes sir and you know how much you're going to drive every week well i used to um i used to know uh fairly close to exactly how many miles i drove because i i was very convenient i lived uh uh nine tenths of a mile from work huh so so was uh you know two miles a day to and from work so it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot but now i've just bought a new house and i'm a half hour uh and so my uh transportation costs have gone up by uh five times yeah i understand that we we have a real similar situation ours uh quintupled at least uh so there is a real family budget yeah pretty much um the problem is there never seems to be enough money uh i have three children and uh it seems like the more money you make the more money you have the more things that they seem to need and uh of course nothing ever goes down i mean uh i remember you know i have five children total i have three left in the house yeah and i can remember years ago when uh school would start and i'd go buy all five kids you know shoes and i could get out of the out of the uh shoe store without spending more than thirty five dollars nowadays thirty five dollars buys about one pair of shoes if you're lucky yeah so i mean things have just really gone out of sight in the last uh i guess about the last ten years exempt or nonexempt i'm exempt wow must be nice part of the high price spread uh no uh well we don't we do but we don't have a family budget we have the fixed things that we have to pay um-hum and we have the things that are extras but it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist yeah and well you know the auto budget car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry um-hum and insurance is insurance bad there um i've got uh two older cars there both one's a seventy seven and one's a seventy eight well we've got one eighty nine and uh my insurance is about uh it was running about four hundred dollars a year but when i moved to the new town i live in because it's a different county which has less crime and uh less you know less highways and so it's a cheaper place to live as far as the insurance company's concerned so my my i think my insurance dropped about uh sixty dollars a year wow that's that's not bad four hundred and something a year that's that's well it's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars so that's cheaper than we pay yeah yeah i was down in Texas for two years and i was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance um they well here in Colorado it's even worse because we have uh no fault yeah do you have that there uh in Maryland they uh they have no fault in Maryland also well no fault's rather funny in Colorado because uh it seems that everyone pays all the time yeah instead of just the guilty party pays um-hum yeah it's kind of it's kind of strange here the way things go uh here if you have an accident and no one's injured the police won't even show up you're kidding nope they tell you if nobody's injured you all exchange names and take it up with your insurance company God well if you i don't know how familiar you are with Maryland but uh especially the the center part of Maryland where i ninety five runs through it is really heavily populated not at all and there's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it take another police force just to answer the traffic they don't even try to keep up with it no God so you lived in Texas for a while not a bit yes sir huh i spent uh couple years down there moved down there in eighty seven and moved out in eighty nine are where you from originally uh right here in Maryland huh so you just basically went home when you had a chance and my family yeah my family uh didn't like Texas and i had a chance to uh transfer up TI bought a company about seven months after i moved to Texas right here in Hunt Valley uh that's nice so i got an opportunity to transfer back and i took it God that's great uh no i'm a native Texan yeah um-hum west Texan yeah there is a difference yeah believe me i know there is i lived in Plano and i don't know if you're familiar with Plano but Plano maybe five percent of the Plano actually were from Texas yeah everybody else was an import well i'm i'm a west Texan Lubbock Midland Odessa um-hum yes Amarillo Dumas Panhandle yeah a different world from down there yeah so uh Colorado's been fun but they have a real problem um next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile and every time you look at a look at the mountains yeah or think about looking at the mountains you got to throw in a dollar or or so it seems i i may just be paranoid but that state income tax is just eating me alive yeah yeah they have a state income tax in Maryland but i noticed when i was in the in the in Texas they didn't have a state income tax but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and school taxes and property taxes yeah yeah property taxes and yeah well Colorado oh my God ate you alive inspection you know they have the state income tax um-hum but then they also have property taxes and they also have sales taxes and they just and they just get you every direction they can yeah and i just don't know sir but they it seems like they trying to get you every which way yeah it sure does um there's uh some good books that i've read um that you might be interested in um Charles D Gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night TV and he's got seminars you can go to and they try to hook you into his organization which costs about four hundred bucks oh yeah but he's got a couple of books out one of them is called um Wealth Without Risk i've heard of the book yes it's a very good book it's tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then what to do legally what to do with the money that you save legally cut money on your taxes huh yes yes sir legally legally cut money on your taxes and on your uh insurance and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to uh uh you know be wealthier uh he also has a new book out that i purchased right before i moved and haven't had a chance to uh crack it open yet um Financial Self Defense i believe is the name of it uh the man uh has a lot of good ideas some of them i already knew about some of them i had already practiced but i suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because uh and that includes everyone at TI yes yes i'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety one yes well even the you know the non exempts technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet yet but when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter yeah you know survival is a funny state yeah i know what you mean i uh when i was in Dallas i was supervisor and i had uh four non exempts um under me yes and uh i i was appalled at what the hell they were paying them i just couldn't believe it did well i've been with the company sixteen years now i was a WF for several years um-hum it just never never seems to improve it it and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either unless you're twenty eight or above yeah it's really a shame well i i've this company that they bought they ended up buying a very high payroll oh and uh the you know uh i thought i was making a good wage you know high wage till i came  hum that was twenty minutes twenty minutes yeah i i thought they gave up after a little while but i'm sure glad you were home i think we're going to discuss why we think uh uh so few people vote in national elections and even fewer in local elections that's it yep and that's what we're going to talk about okay and uh uh okay where do you work Karen i don't work my husband works nope i'm just one of those housewives oh okay how did you get how how yeah how did you get in the program uh my husband and my father both work at TI in Sherman so yeah oh that's neat they both work in Sherman yeah i work in TI in Dallas here how many calls have you been in on this year oh goodness um i i can't really say i haven't i haven't listed them or anything oh i don't know i haven't been i i hope the computer keeping track of them because i'm not well yeah i've enjoyed them so it doesn't really matter oh i do too i i just really i i try to get in one a night if somebody doesn't call me i call somebody okay you you about ready yeah okay by the way you don't sound like you're from Dallas that's why i didn't think you don't sound you sound like you're from the north that's why i didn't think you were from oh okay huh oh well it's funny you should say something like that because uh i'm from Dallas for thirty two years i was from New England originally oh really well that's why i picked it up yes you have you have a northern accent but i don't have a New England accent oh my parents have a New England accent but i don't well not i didn't say New England but i could definitely tell your from the north oh it's northern well i've been i've been everywhere i've lived overseas for TI for ten years uh four four years in Malaysia rather seven years and three years in the Philippines and i lived in Pittsburgh before i came here i was raised in New England so it's but i've been here thirty two years so i sort of consider myself a Texan i got a yeah well you never i don't think you ever lose that that that which you which you begin with that accent no i've got a i've got a Texan wife and three Texan children you're still are i myself am a native Texan so you can never as a native Texan you can never become a Texan unless you were born here and have right where where you native Karen where was i i was born in Dallas so i've been i've been in this area for most all my life yeah yeah where what part of Texas oh okay now i i i ask that because my wife is from the Palestine area in East Texas and you can tell she's native too yeah oh yeah they have much more of a twang down in that area okay okay right right well i'm going to push one and let them start recording okay okay Karen uh you know it always has amazed me and in fact i think i wrote a paper on this in college uh that the national elections uh just have so few people voting in them you know uh maybe uh fifty percent or less of the electorate have you ever thought much about it well yes i have um i was in the military for a while and it really bothered me to think that people that are affected so you know so closely by you know that it comes so close to home as far as the government you know that because they are so directly connected with it and yet so few of them were registered to vote did and and it really it really used to bother me and then and then i'd hear complaints about this and that that was you know was happening to those of us in the military the cuts and things like that and i would be like well are you registered to vote have you you know made any uh changes you know as far as your voting habits on you know who who you're voting for and what you're looking for and and uh no they'd say no and i'd be well then shut up you know you don't really have much you don't have much that you can say so how do you vote how do you vote in the military do you vote absentee in your own registered state um-hum yeah you vote absentee yeah you vote you you still connected to your state legally you still you can you still are responsible for paying those taxes they withdraw taxes yeah for for that state if like in Texas we don't have it so yeah but but if you are they withdraw that from your pay and uh you can be you can we don't have a state income tax right you can uh be have suits brought against you as if you were from that state yeah so you are attached to that state from which you came from from that state um-hum um-hum yeah right i'm going to inject a little side anecdote for you back to the to the uh uh the main topic here because it it you might be interested in this uh you know i i've to voting uh-huh uh as i mentioned i've had seven years of expatriate expatriate service with TI and uh you vote in the embassy uh uh from whatever country you're in you go to the United States Embassy and vote there um-hum and uh i was in the Phillipines uh in Portugal not stationed there but i was i was there on business and visiting a family that i knew very well in fact the guy had been my boss when we were in Malaysia and uh it was with with TI and i went to his house for dinner and they had a young son who was probably about in the seventh grade and was attending a British school in uh uh in Portugal and this was in uh this was just nineteen eighty four just uh prior maybe in the summer prior to the eighty four election and i went home for dinner to dinner with this fellow and they were they were Texans and uh they lived there in Portugal and his wife said gee the darndest thing happened today she said i'm so embarrassed she said i was over at Reed's school and Margaret Thatcher came and spoke to the to the uh the parents it was a British school so she was there visiting in Portugal and she visited this British school and spoke to parents and after it was over she said i went up to her and i said Mrs Thatcher i'm a great admirer of yours uh-huh and she said what i wanted to uh uh i've always wanted to meet you and i've enjoyed this opportunity to meet you and uh Margaret Thatcher said oh you're you're an American yes she said well something i want to ask you about she said when you're American and away from home in an election year like this how do you vote and and my friend said oh if nothing changes i'll vote for Reagan and she said oh my goodness no i didn't mean that and poor Janet realized immediately she didn't mean that she meant what was the process of voting and Margaret Thatcher was embarrassed that Janet would think that she was going to ask her how she was going to vote and it was so funny and her husband kept looking at her and said i can't believe you could be so dumb but uh i it's it's interesting though people that do we've had noticed we had been in Malaysia during one election year and the Philippines in another that there seems to be a higher percent of the expatriate population i mean well over fifty percent that do bother to register with the embassy and go vote you'd almost think that you think you're more important when you're out of the country and you're exposed to some things um-hum i think i think sometimes that you um you pick you become more aware of what you have um-hum and how important it is to you you become more loyal so to speak to to the things that you don't have at that time and you realize hey my you know we really have a good thing there so i think you hold more dear the things like democracy and your rights yeah true you know as an American citizen but i think uh the people that i've talked to as far as voting because i've worked you know in in trying to get people to vote when i was in the military i was a uh represented you know i represented people as far as voting and um from what i spoke speaking with people it was mainly that um they felt frustrated that their one vote wasn't going to do any good you know that um and and it was really hard to get across to them that it didn't matter you know it's a matter of that's your right you should go and do it you know and that your one vote can count when you get a whole lot of people if everybody says oh well my vote doesn't count you know then then what do you have you know that's exactly right and they don't realize that that it's it's all onesies and the onesies all add up yeah you know the thing that that i surprised me even more you know if we got a good contest going we do manage to get fifty percent out in national elections and uh but what's even worse is the off year congressional elections uh when there's not a presidential election uh and the local election and it bothers me and i i think that's even more important to vote in those because uh oh sure and yeah well you can make a big difference in those and it's more more to home a lot of the time yeah and it's it's like a school board election you know those of us with children in school are very concerned about what goes on uh in the school system yet school board members are elected with sometimes ten to fifteen percent of the electorate turning out yeah isn't that ridiculous and yeah and and you know the one of the things that i can still remember a college professor standing up pointing his pipe at a class one day while he was lecturing and he said the problem of the vote is that the American uh public is sometimes asked to go to the polls too often and to make too many and too difficult decisions and i think of that every time i go find one of these ballots and you not only get it in the presidential year uh where where you go down through eight or nine judgeships and uh uh yeah but don't you think in a way that's kind of a cop out i mean it still is your responsibility and and and and nowadays they do have more information that you can become aware of and there are things like the League of Women Voters or some of the other groups what oh yeah it it still is your responsibility that you know put give out uh nonbiased information just general information on how the candidates stand on certain issues that you know you can make a decision on how you feel about certain issues and who you want right to represent you and so i really don't i don't agree that you have too many choices that you know it's it's too hard and i think that people are just lazy i think they don't want to get out yeah i yeah i i i think you're right there and i'm glad you mentioned the League of Women Voters i've i don't know how long they've been around maybe a long time but it's only in my more mature years that i have become aware of them oh really and and i make a real effort to go out and read all and particularly read their things about the candidates for lesser offices that you don't you can't read their view in the paper uh and i i think that is tremendously important and yeah yeah  okay what kind of hobbies do you have um mostly what i do i do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing and then i i read a lot um-hum i like to read too i was trying to think of some while while it was uh talking about it and then i it took so long for someone to answer i started reading the newspaper and kind of forgot about it but uh oh yeah i i'd say reading's probably one of my biggest ones because it's the type of thing that you can you can do a little bit at a time whereas i would love to do crafts and stuff if i just had the time to do it and uh-huh or if i had the space i live in a pretty small apartment and uh i would have to you know put stuff away i have two cats so i couldn't really leave it out if i was working on something so reading is a little bit easier to work around yeah um-hum yeah you can pick it up and take it wherever you go that's right fills up any time of space i get too involved in reading sometimes that i neglect what i should be doing so i you get so involved in what you're reading that's true i do the same thing what types of crafts do you do um i do some little bit of woodworking well i used to i i don't have the equipment here we moved to Dallas about a year ago and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment and i did some of that um here i've mostly done things that i can do strictly by hand um sewing um-hum um-hum and quilting and um um-hum what else have i done things to hang on the wall um-hum mostly just stuff that i can you know use right around the house um-hum or give away as gifts right i've been making a lot of quilts well not a lot but several quilts lately uh-huh so i enjoy uh sewing and needlework also i've i've uh made some small things um cross stitch things and um back when i was in high school i worked um-hum at a uh needlework shop and i i used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that and i i still remember how to do it it's just been so long since i've actually sat down and and taken the time to do something like that but i have recently done some cross stitch um-hum and i enjoy doing that it's just the same old thing it's just getting the time to do it yeah i've done some cross um cross stitch but i never count right and i always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered or or something it never has worked it out completely right um-hum yeah it takes a lot of concentration i mean it was the type of thing i was i was making some little things for Christmas and i also made a little thing for a baby gift and uh i thought oh i can do this while i watch TV wrong yeah right no you must pay all attention to what you're doing it's it's it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be it took me uh quite a bit of time i thought oh this won't take long at all but i was wrong it took while it took a while to do but it was fun i enjoyed it um-hum yeah the first project project i started out one was a big one it was uh it was of a lady and she was kneeling and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe oh my gosh and i it was just too much to start with and i still haven't finished it because i stopped i stopped and i thought well i better do some simple things and work up to this because it was just so difficult to to get it done and there were so many different shadings and colors and uh-huh yeah and uh it it was just too much to begin with and i think that kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it yeah that's pretty understandable and i've done some of the crewel and the um um-hum something similar to that but it doesn't have the specific stitches anyway it's a little bit more loose and not uh quite as structured and i like that a little bit better the variety of stitches and stuff in that uh-huh yeah more like embroidery or something but i'm trying to think of anything else i do as a hobby um i don't even watch TV very much i was tonight but yeah i was reading when you called um how about movies do you like to go to movies yeah um yeah i do i do like to go to movies and uh i have a VCR so i like to rent movies and um i have right now i have the movie channel so i've i've recorded quite a few movies off of that um um-hum just i've kind of got a collection going of tapes now and whenever i go visit my parents they're always saying well bring some of your tapes and they they always borrow a few of them i was over there they live in Duncanville and i was over there at Easter uh-huh and they said bring some tapes with you so they they are always borrowing my tapes yeah well we but uh i like to i like to do uh stuff with plants i like um i have a lot of plants in my apartment and i've got a pretty small porch but it's it's uh i've got a few planters out there that i i'll uh you know in the winter time i usually plant some pansies in there and then in the summer i'll plant petunias or something that that's colorful and like that blooms a lot but uh haven't done that yet it i i kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time but i think we're probably past that now i probably should go buy some but um-hum yeah i guess if i had a house i might enjoy gardening some i'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that but yeah the hard work yeah it's yeah i like the planting and and watering is okay it's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers it's so beautiful i mean we don't we live in an apartment also uh-huh but i've got a few plants here but um i'm not really really knowledgeable i i i feel real good if i water them and they continue to grow you know i feel like oh i've accomplished something so i enjoy it but i'm just not experienced enough with it to uh-huh yeah i don't know too much about it either mine's pretty limited to my little uh porch plants and and then the ones in my apartment half of which don't look real healthy but i don't always get direct sun uh-huh oh yeah except in certain spots and so that's probably my problem there but uh have you tried any growing any um like fruits and vegetables or anything i guess vegetables are inside inside like in pots and stuff um-hum no i never have tried that just because i don't have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment um or this little balcony and my my other two pots are they're kind of they're pretty big and and i have enough plants in them that um uh-huh it it takes up a lot of my porch area so between that a nd the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood there's no room for much else but my dad uh excuse me my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house and i'd i think when i was real little i probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to you know be out there and watch and that type of stuff but i've never really tried anything like that since then um-hum well i've considered it last year and this year both but i haven't done anything about it so um-hum i think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch we get lots of sunlight here and the porch is screened in and it's pretty large uh-huh oh wow so u m i think if i just would be if i'd do something be motivated enough to do something i think it would work out well uh-huh but but there there goes that motivation thing again right well i enjoy playing with my cats i don't know if you'd call that a hobby but i have two cats and i gave them a bath tonight so they're a little bit angry at me but uh they didn't like it too much oh do are you can you put them can you put them right in the water or oh that's good yeah oh yeah right in the tub and and it helps because it's the time of the year that they're shedding a lot and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine so i thought well this'll help you know help them shed and yeah and sure enough boy the fur just came off like crazy once i got them in the tub so oh yeah they're pretty content now but they they were mad at me for quite a while they went and hid after they after they got dried off sulked for a while huh well i like animals but we don't have any yet we have a nine month old with another on the way and we thought well maybe when they're a little bit bigger then we'll or get into a house with a little more space yeah uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah i'd i'd love to have have some animals uh-huh but i like dogs and my husband like cats so we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet if we get a place where we can have both it'll be great but until then yeah yeah i like both but since i'm in an apartment i just i don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog dogs to me dogs need a yard even little dogs they just need a yard um-hum yeah cats cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine but i just think dogs need need to be outside so yeah i agree with you i if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat um-hum but or even a bird or a fish tank or something you know yeah now that's an idea with the with the small babies something small that she can watch but won't take too much care yeah because you kind of even even a cat you never know when they might bite or scratch or something there not as likely to as a dog might i guess but so um-hum with little ones i'd be kind of scared to get anything that that has teeth or claws yeah yeah especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting you know that they they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk and oh yeah and if i was a cat or dog i'd respond probably by biting or something i don't know that would be my self-defense but oh yeah um-hum yeah well i i think we probably reached our time limit yeah probably so cause and i'm out of out of good ideas for a hobby anyway so well it was good talking to you okay well thank you for calling bye-bye all right bye-bye  personal computers are are nice i guess if you can afford them the the problem if you happen to use one at work is you tend to get spoiled with the uh maybe a higher grade one maybe the the economics and the payback of having one at a business is a little bit better than having one at home and i've read a few articles that uh where people have nice uh three eighty six machines and nice graphics and the nice software packages and then when they come home they they just can't stand to come down to the X T level and and don't like the the slowness or the in some cases not even having a hard drive and that's pretty much where i fall into i use a a relatively nice array of machines at work for scientific purposes and i have a variety of of uh speeds and complexity of machines depending upon the instrument that it's controlling and then i have one that i do just general purpose work on and then for the house i don't have anything uh not that i wouldn't want one but i would probably not be satisfied with anything less than a really nice one and that's that's a quite an expense and then all the software tends to be uh commercial grade it's all where i guess you know to get something like WordPerfect you're looking at uh five hundred dollars worth or so and some of the accounting packages or the the nicer spreadsheets are somewhat expensive and i don't know it's it's quite a a expense or a luxury for the house i guess and there's not a whole lot i would do other than some word processing i i got a a number of things that i could could be doing on a PC instead of here instead of doing them at the home at work they're for the house but i do them on occasion at work and it's nice to uh it would be nice to have one i guess what do you think i share your your uh sense when you change job to work or job to home uh the way your your image of the machine changes i tend to do slightly different things at home than i do at work um i use One Two Three a lot the Lotus product as a spreadsheet and i have i use a uh uh-huh what you see is what you get editor for almost all of my word processing so i have not although i have access at home to things like Works and WordPerfect uh but i i do not obviously notice it i i think the thing that surprises me most when i change work to home environment is the cursor speed and after i if initially get over the uh the cursor speed in the sense of moving linearly across the screen uh as opposed to tabbing uh-huh uh i'm a touch typer and i haven't ever really noticed uh differences uh the machine tends to react as fast as i can i use an eighty as a matter of fact use an eighty eighty eight at at home uh which is really old iron uh probably ten years or so and and at the office uh i am indeed using a three eighty six um i use a PC for a great deal of things in in private life uh i'm a church treasurer um and i use the machine a lot on a uh uh data base and financial package that that operates at the church office i do some uh volunteer work at home using uh a buttons PC file program that uh is a very simplistic relational data base for labels and things so i guess i would have to say on a home setting i'm probably on the personal computer as much as an hour a day on average at home um well that's good um except i don't have a concern too much about the speed however because most of the applications i find are as fast as i am if not more so and i tend to notice it more when it comes down to an issue of peripherals uh at work i'm used to various batch printing capabilities and uh pretty high-speed output either laser printer uh uh-huh or uh machines like uh IBM thirty eight twenty high speed uh APA printers and so i get frustrated uh watching things slowly come out upon my matrix printer more so than i do over over access speed um right i guess that i have gotten to the point where if if i didn't have the personal computer i would be impacted a great deal on the things that i do in my life i'm i'm sure i would probably find ways to return to what i was doing in nineteen eighty one when i got my first home computer but it it would be i think a dramatic a dramatic sense of loss on on some items on your editor do you do uh does it do spell correcting or any kind of thesaurus work uh no i have access to uh spell correction uh material i seldom i seldom use it although when i'm at the office and i'm producing work correspondence uh i i run about ninety per cent of my office work on a mainframe uh-huh uh i i execute on a three eighty six machine that is attached to the mainframe as a server as a intelligent work station but i use it uh-huh frequently as a dumbhead to get to the mainframe and and there i tend on almost all of my editing and stuff to to be using some fairly powerful right editors and word processors and and wordproof but surprisingly at home and i seldom ever bother uh or worry about it too much uh i guess ultimately i'm not a a horribly bad speller although i have a tendency to lisp when i type so to speak uh nothing that that's particularly horrible and i think most of the work word processing i do since it's somewhat of a personal nature i've probably don't have a sense of vulnerability in this in in the even that i were to send to to send a a misspelled word out the way one might have at the office place right well i tend to that's one thing i notice the speed difference in when i have a darc document that's maybe twenty or thirty pages long and i want to uh search through it for the spelling it takes forever on an old uh X T at at four point seven seven megahertz you know the the old old ones and we're looking at uh several minutes worth of time for it to go through and check everything as opposed to a three eighty six where i can just you know it flashes through there and then even just file copying i i do some of that every once in awhile and you know if you had thirty or forty files to copy from one place to another and you're maybe reorganizing some places on the hard drive i have an X T at work oh excuse me i have an X T at work that takes forever to copy and then i have a three eighty six that just you know they're they're gone they're just over there right away okay and little things like that i i've noticed the speed difference in and i do some graphics uh i haven't done any well i've done a little bit for the for the house at work but uh if i were to bring it home uh or have a machine at home i would like to be able to put together small uh brochure type things with the the front page being a little little bit of graphics and the inside being printed in a uh what i would call a booklet form there are some editors that will produce uh the you know print it sideways and and collate it in such a way that this page comes out right so that you can fold all these eight and a half by elevens and make a little booklet and right my i've done that on occasion at at work and my wife does some uh teaching you know little bitty weekend type teaching for some women in the area and and she likes to work up little outlines and things in this format and so i do all the work for her at work and it would really be nice to be able to do it here and say is this what you want you know instead of going back and forth every day it takes us a little while to get it right but uh i don't know maybe someday we'll uh get around to getting something decent uh that's that's an interesting point i think a the more i as i've thought about to bring home our conversation i realize that one of the things that perhaps causes me not to get a jarring difference between the two locations is that at the office i'm doing work things that in some ways are dissimilar from what i do at home uh and as a result i don't get the comparative feel uh i suspect if i were coming home and trying to do some of the projects i do at the office i would go crazy on my on my machine uh i haven't tended to play the games and and uh do the applications at work that i do at home so i probably have never been in right noticed how wonderful it might be uh i suspect Lotus One Two Three and spreadsheet application might be the one common thread um and there i think that even though i'm on an eighty eighty eight at home that the speed is really quite adequate uh and and i consequently don't even really notice uh the the difference between the the fast machine and and the eighty eighty eight uh-huh yeah unless they're tremendously large they're not going to make that much difference right right i i do have some uh retirement modeling that i've done at home that uh tends to crawl uh which on which i've just turned the calculation off in between and a couple of models that i've uh-huh built uh for for school purposes that i start in the evening and then go to bed and get them the next morning but they would have run an hour and a half even on a thirty three eighty six machine i imagine so um i suspect that what happens is that uh you get to the point where it's so long that uh from a human being perspective there's not much difference between six hours and an hour and a half right um that's interesting i hadn't i hadn't run into anything quite that long or fortunately there  well we haven't really heard that much in the news lately about uh US involvement in Latin America since uh all this Middle East crisis began so i haven't really paid that much attention like since back in August when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on um Iraq and the so the last thing that i remember hearing that much about is the Iran-Contra scandal that happened in the Reagan presidency can you think of anything else that's happened recently no i would agree with you we haven't had too much but uh historically we've always uh almost been like a big brother to in and to the Latin American area and uh almost used them i i i feel um i think something will have to be done down there very soon about uh um-hum about Mexico and and uh some of the other areas but with the Persian Gulf as you said it's just uh been very quiet i i keep pretty close tabs on the paper and you don't hardly see a unless it's there and we're just not seeing it well the only uh references that i have seen lately has been uh in part of the overmilitarization of Iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things and and they made references to in the past um-hum how we have given arms to uh Nicaragua and to other places in Latin America and that those might turn around and haunt us someday i mean not not to this large scale as Iraq but that whenever we give arms to people well it's um-hum as as we did and as we sold arms to pardon me to Iraq when we wanted them to fight Iran and then uh and then it turned around and um-hum um-hum i i agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world and so um there's a lot of money to be made there and it's uh be very difficult to to cut it back to a level where it should be and and then it will come back to haunt us it seems to come in cycles um-hum and i know when i spent the time that i've studied in Mexico uh since Spanish was one of my majors in college that uh there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards America um-hum about uh like you say using them you our interest there is you know what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them and that we weren't normally very interested in them and they have in other in most Latin American countries they right there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries you know that they have corruption and and they don't have um i mean there's just very few really modern cities right and the probably the biggest biggest problem down there is that's where the that's the drug entry points in their economies um-hum of several several of the countries especially Columbia is so built on the on the on the drugs that uh our our little war on drugs has really been laughable it's just a you know such a small amount and it does it just it um cuts off just a trickle and uh if if we can't get a handle on that through some through some uh method i don't know where where that'll be another big problem well that's right because that's just so much of the way that they make their money and so many communities have uh have to have that for farming and they don't look at it so much as you know right right and as long as we're the largest uh consumer then uh this is the market um-hum that's right if we can cut back the usage then uh maybe it'll have to go someplace else and i think it's really very sad that north of the border you know the United States and Canada is so different from the South from South America and Central America there's really a disparity between the um um-hum um-hum yeah what you i would call civilization of the countries you know right yeah we're just so much wealthier and uh and uh there has to be resentment built up and that's where uh leaders can use uh use that whenever the opportune moment arises um-hum yes it's really kind of sad and that we would go all the way to Iraq and that we would be very concerned with the situation between Jerusalem and yeah uh Israel and the Middle East Arab countries and and when we have when we have a lot of problems right right in our own back door that's right our own hemisphere but we've that's been uh that's been the way it's always been hm so i guess we've kind of neglected Latin America so uh very much so except when we need them you know when they found oil in Mexico then we got very friendly with them again right recently yeah fairly recently well that's really sad i hadn't thought about that in a long time yeah hm well i guess then i will go but i made me stop and think a minute about okay sure did not worrying so much about the Middle East crisis i know that it's not settled but there are other areas that we could focus our attention on well thank you you have a good day bye-bye always yes ma'am you too dear bye  so uh Deanna where do you like to fish well we usually go fishing at Toledo Bend um-hum and um my parents they're the fishermen and my brother uh i i usually don't do too much fishing i usually take my raft and float along behind the boat and get a suntan um-hum oh great great but they love to crappie fish my brother likes to bass fish so um uh-huh what what do you what do you use for bait for crappie and bass for crappie they use shiners um-hum and um bass my brother usually puts a jig or something like that on there for it or a top water bait you know sometimes usually artificial bait for bass um-hum um-hum and then um we sometimes get crickets and they they fish for bream and i've never used crickets before do you use them live yeah you haven't what you put put the hooks through their little back and they just jump around under the water um-hum and and and and what are crickets good for bream brim um-hum um-hum uh-huh and um also they have these uh wasp the the um larvae is that what it's called wasp wasp larvae um-hum oh yeah yeah and uh oh anytime we can find those my parents just scoop up on those because they are so good for fishing um-hum um-hum and um they use those a lot but usually it's either shiners or oh just a minute i got to see who that is okay so anyway uh uh do you ever fish for catfish no we usually don't do i mean they catch catfish i keep saying they because i never fish but um they catch catfish you on accident sometimes oh okay and then whenever we do trot lines and stuff they usually get catfish are they are they big ones um uh usually not too big probably maybe two or three pounds you know i've seen some huge catfish um-hum yeah yeah i think you have to go deep for those don't you though don't they kind of just kind of scavenge along the bottom of of wherever they are the bottom yeah um-hum yeah uh what what kind of a boat do y'all have well we used to just have a little aluminum boat but uh my dad has sold it so he's hunting a boat now i think he's looking into Bass Tracker um-hum um-hum he found him one last weekend that he really liked but we haven't gotten it yet so oh yeah yeah well we don't have a boat we usually fish off the shore or off the dock and my i've got a son that's a senior in high school and he just loves he loves fishing i i don't have the patience that he does well oh i agree uh you know it's it's sitting there on the dock and you go a hour and nothing's happened he says no dad i know they're down there let's not go i know they're down there and they're and they're gonna bite anytime and uh that's right we're talking about fishing today daddy uh uh he got into a place where uh we were in there where there was a bunch of sand bass schooling and my goodness oh he was throwing this was one day last summer and he every as often as he could throw that hook out there he'd get one but we don't deplete the fish population because we pull them up and look at them admire them and take them off and throw them back although he went somewhere with some friends last week and fished for catfish and got them and i think it's the first time that he's ever that he's actually prepared and ate what they caught he and some friends of his the first time they've ever done anything but throw them back oh but uh we we you know we we started with just rudimentary things like worms and night crawlers and uh and uh uh gone to uh minnows and can catch just a lot of sandies or even catfish with minnows uh and we take we fish at Lake Texoma oh and and then and then just kind of stop there on the way by and get the uh and and get the and get minnows and uh it's it's pretty lot of fun except i say you got to have a lot of patience because some days it doesn't seem like anything's down there at all yeah and then other other days uh uh you you can pull them in with some degree of regularity it seems as the summer comes when it gets warm and you have calm days without a lot of wind they seem to be uh far more prevalent well i just do not have the patience for it but i mean we usually um keep our fish that are right size you know that are a good eating size because my parents love to eat fish but no yeah oh sure um the little ones we throw back or my dad will bring them home and put them in my fish tank yeah throw throw them back and let them get bigger so you can come get them next year yeah yeah yeah and catch them next time yeah but you know at at Texoma it's such a big lake and we don't have a boat but we're on the dock and people come in there's a lot of sandy islands out in the middle of Texoma uh-huh and they go out and fish around there and people come in with these ice chests just full of of you know twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen inch long fish oh great it's the darndest thing i've ever seen and i don't know we we're probably going to have to get us a boat one of these days soon and go out and see go out and see what's really out there they are so expensive oh yeah i know they are i used to have one that we used to ski ski behind oh i love to ski and and before our our children came along my wife and i used to ski all the time then when the and we kept it on it was an eighteen footer it was kind of big to haul over the road so we kept it at a lake tied up yeah um-hum and then when your children are very little you can't go out and do things like that and it got so the insurance and the and the uh and the tie up fee uh was yeah gigantic compared to what use we were getting out of it so i went and sold it and never bought again and it's too bad now that the kids are teenagers they want they'd love to get out there and learn to ski and do the boating and fishing again so we'll probably do something like that oh yeah do you do you camp at the lake a lot yeah we um we usually do probably usually in the springtime or in the fall in the summer but not in the summer yeah the summer time's a little too hot oh okay um we usually go pitch a tent and we stay out there for the weekend or um for the week matter of fact i think we're going to go again in in May um-hum the middle of May we're uh planning a trip down to Toledo Bend and sometimes we rent a trailer and then oh um-hum where where is Toledo Bend um it's between the Texas and Louisiana border oh okay it's uh it's on that s ide it's on the east east side what's what's the nearest big city um daddy what's the nearest big city to Toledo Bend this lake's huge i mean it's huge yeah and i was i is it out like near Tyler or Texarkana or Parish he says its exactly half way between Shreveport and Dallas oh okay exactly half way between Shreveport and Dallas um how how long does it take you to get there from Shreveport it's um it usually takes us we it takes about an hour or an hour and a half for us to get there daddy yeah and then my brother will meet us half way since he works you you know he lives in Dallas he usually meets us half way and oh do you work in Shreveport or go to school or what i go to school i go to LSU oh what are you majoring in communications oh my goodness i have been on the LSU campus once i took a recruiting trip for TI there about uh uh eight or nine years ago oh and i was oh i was ever so impressed with the campus in fact it was a two day trip and between appointments i got a chance to walk around and see it uh-huh and uh what a what a fabulous darn school it was i was just really really impressed with it well gosh thanks and and i know it's getting off the subject a little bit but i i do you follow a lot of the sports at LSU yeah i sure do i try to i mean um okay well we're we're we're very strong uh women's women's basketball team fans oh so we we follow your basketball team your your women's basketball team a lot and well great yeah i i also try to follow Tech Louisiana Tech the yeah your oh of course they are one of the best uh they didn't do as well this year but we saw them we went down to Austin last year and saw them beat the Longhorns in the regionals yeah they are oh and and uh man they were i guess they went to the final four last year and and didn't make it through but we were just uh uh just really impressed with them what what year are you in at LSU uh-huh i am almost a junior after this semester in May i'll be a junior uh-huh and what do you plan on doing when you get out uh i want to be a cruise director oh gee what a deal on like on Love Boat huh yeah kind of i guess hey that's a neat thing um i'd like to do that for a few years and then whenever i get settled down i would like to go back and teach college i'd like to be a professor uh-huh are you you then plan on maybe getting an advanced degree somewhere yeah i'm gonna um go ahead and go straight in and get my Master's degree oh at LSU you gonna stay there no i'm gonna go to uh i'm gonna send check into the University of Colorado oh because they have a um special program a Master's one year's Master's program where i can get my Master's in one year um-hum so um what would it take about thirty hours or something like that thirty two thirty six i think it's thirty six yeah okay so that would be two long semesters and a summer maybe huh um-hum it i mean it's going to take a lot of hard work but um you need yeah okay oh sure sure well i think i think uh uh the best thing to do is i i got two Masters degrees but they both came years after my Bachelor's degree uh-huh and if i had it to do all over again i would do what you're planning to do like continue um-hum you need to get it while you're still hot that's what everybody has said because once you get out and make that money it's so hard to get back into it it it is it is very hard to go back and and actually the academic part isn't bad when your when you resume because it seems that things come easier because you're more mature and you've got all your life experiences and i thought the academic part would be harder but it really isn't uh because uh it because uh uh i don't know i think the maturity factor uh uh overcomes the fact that you've had a gap yeah but nevertheless it's it's so much it's so hard to get back to it and it's it's so much easier while you've got your academic juices flowing well what were what are your degrees in i have uh my first one's in my Bachelor's in Chemistry and my Master's in Physics and in uh in Management uh uh uh quality management i've been in i've been in quality management with TI and engineering management and and uh oh goodness  okay well what what do you think is the uh the main change in uh what what generation are you i'm i'm thirty years old i'm twenty nine you're twenty nine okay so we're we're we're both uh children of the very early sixties right and i have i mean i've seen some change like i know um when i was young most mothers pretty much were housewives and stayed at home with the kids and to me it seems like um-hum um-hum it's almost the opposite now where the the woman is working and and they you know take the children to child care or maybe they work part-time or something um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum so that seems to be a pretty big change yeah the family structure in general is being really restructured from one income to two incomes which means from one parent to two part-time parents if you're lucky um um-hum yeah right i uh it's it's funny because both of us both of us then were really just adolescents when when i think most of the major changes for adult women were going on uh-huh in America i don't think changes are are still progressing but it seems to me that the uh really the seventies the early seventies was a period of the most change and if i had to be somewhat abstract about it it seems to be the major change has been that woman have acquired more choice um-hum um-hum oh that's true that's true uh i mean that's sort of the overall the meta the meta change as it were uh where that woman really have more of a choice now about what they do um-hum um-hum um of course they find that the choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if it is for your you know you can choose something you really want which is a wonderful thing but it does seem like an awful lot of my uh um-hum my adult women friends are anguishing over over some of these choices um right well i know the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because i think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you you know you protected the children and you um-hum you want to be with the children yet there's so many material things to be had out there that a lot of people think oh but if we both work we can get a really big house and we can get two really nice cars we can take a vacation we can do this and yes yes yes and it's kind of almost expected of you anyway people kind of look down on on a you know the role of a woman as a housewife it's kind of like oh well you know she didn't go to college and she's just a housewife and that's all she does right right she just settled for that yeah right even though there's probably women with MBA's maybe even PhD's that are staying at home with the children um well i only know i have my friends who have had children uh i only know one woman who's decided to go the quote unquote traditional route and i have a lot of respect for her because she made it as a real choice um-hum um-hum she really knew that she didn't have to do that but she decided that was what she wanted to do in her life and she wanted that role she's a she's a marvelous parent and um-hum and i you know i say all power to her because she's an example to me of someone who really does have the choice i feel that a lot of uh women don't well i i said they have the choice but they don't necessarily feel that they do because they no longer feel like if they were to just be a parent um-hum rather than uh you know the sort of super woman success in the business world as well they would somehow be perceived as a failure in their own eyes or in others and and then you see then it's not a choice anymore um-hum right um-hum um and and frankly it's the way that men are um men don't have this choice you know they don't feel this choice um uh um-hum in most subcultures in America that that i've been exposed to if the man were to say uh no i've decided not to work i want to stay home and do the child rearing my wife has a good job and i want her to keep that uh-huh and i'm going to i'm going to be the primary caretaker and you know and then then take care of the children because we don't want to put them in day care and this and that i think most Americans would feel funny about that and maybe sort of feel like he isn't that success that he could have been yeah right so it's um there's some TV show on now and i i i think i've seen it once i don't get to watch much TV but uh um-hum there's a TV show where the man is the one raising the kids and the wife is and i maybe they based it on that Mister Mom movie but uh um-hum i didn't i didn't see that but uh there there is a TV show out there i guess they're trying to gain you know more public acceptance of things like that because i know there are cases where that happens and oh yeah i've i knew people who did it years ago but they they were very apologetic about it because you could tell they were used to people kind of going what are you doing that for you know uh-huh yeah right it's probably getting more and more accepted today in fact it seems like it's kind of almost like anything goes now you you're not too surprised on much of anything when you know the husband's the one at home raising the children the mother works that's not real surprising and yeah yeah i've seen more and more companies that have um parental leave not just maternity leave they can grant paternity leave as well as maternity leave right yeah in fact i'm pretty sure TI has something like that because uh one of the area supervisors uh in my area as a matter of fact took off um for a couple of weeks when his wife had their baby now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby instead of having you know a a nurse or someone come in or whatever midwife or whatever you call it that they have for the first couple of weeks but um-hum yeah um-hum um-hum yeah but i don't know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do have a paternity he put paternity leave up there but it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation days to go be a father for a little while i don't know um-hum um-hum um-hum but i'm not real sure how that goes yeah the other big change i see in in in woman's lives is um to remain biological they uh women are because they have choice are having children much later in life yeah uh i mean my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty um-hum and uh if i'd been a couple of generations ago they would have had kids running around by then right well people they in general are just getting married a lot later i'm still single so i'm sure i'll be one of those parents that's you know one of those women in her thirties when when i get around to to ever getting married and then having kids so yeah yeah that's uh i think i think that's getting a little more common too yeah i actually think i i'm i'm somewhat encouraged by that trend because after all people live long er lives now so it's not like you can you know it's not like you're going to uh you know pass away before your child is an adult i mean barring unforseen you know unforeseen circumstances um-hum right and i think most people make better parents when they're a little bit more mature i really do yeah i agree i agree i think it also gives a woman a chance to if she does have a job a nd a career it gives the man and the wife both a chance to both be working and maybe save up some money and then it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while they're young um-hum and be a mother for awhile and then once they've gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work so she's kind of got that option if if they wait till later they've saved up some money that it's not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income or something yeah yeah yeah that's true so i guess i oh i'm pretty encouraged i really am but then i'm a product of my generation i don't know i if i'd been born a hundred years ago and were looking at this time i might not like it but it sure seems nice to me yeah uh-huh uh-huh uh i mean i have other things to complain about but in terms of uh woman's roles um things really seem a lot more flexible um-hum i seem to see more women in uh in leadership type roles and management positions in politics and yeah i mean it's still still admittedly a a a small minority but but it's an improvement it really is yeah like the Mayor of Dallas is a woman and i'm sure that twenty years ago that never would have happened but yeah she's i think she's in her second term now so oh really uh-huh she's she's yeah this is her second term i think she's going to going to uh not going to run again after this but uh-huh but uh we do and we have several council women that are women but you just start hearing more and more in fact oh the the Governor of Texas is a woman too can't forget that one so Ann Richards yeah oh what what's her name no it we don't get much Texas politics out in California to be honest she used yeah she was inaugurated in January so uh-huh so you're starting to see more of that and i know when i was younger it was all the President and still all the President are men but i'm sure one of these days we will well look at Ferraro ran for Vice President and i guess one of these days we'll we'll eventually have that's right although during during during the uh Presidential debates there was some really nasty patronizing uh-huh stuff toward i mean i don't know if if you saw those but i thought she was treated badly at for being a woman frankly i really did by by uh um-hum the then vice presidential candidates uh who really sort of i thought had a very demeaning attitude towards her uh-huh yeah and it was sort of it was acceptable to say certain types of things to her that she couldn't say back that kind of thing which i i i i found myself getting really quite enraged about uh-huh um-hum but really that's a previous generation i don't like it's harder to imagine people of our age doing that and not feeling really stupid uh-huh right right i agree well i think we've we've gotten our five five minutes or six or seven or whatever so well they've gotten their five minutes worth of us i've enjoyed talking with you it was nice talking to you too okay take care bye-bye you too bye-bye  okay so which uh what basketball teams are you interested in well i guess i'm a big Laker LA Laker fan when it comes to pros um-hum uh uh the college ranks um i guess i really of course i try to follow my alma mater that's uh BYU um-hum in Utah but they don't have much of a team usually no they're more of a football team than they are basketball team yeah yeah they you see them in football on TV once in awhile but you but you never see them on a yeah on nationally basketball you know that's true i don't think i've ever seen them nationally on basketball they uh last year they had a really good team was the year that Danny Aines was there um-hum that's about five six years ago by now hum so they made it to the sweet sixteen once or twice in their history and that's um yeah that's not too bad and they usually lose in the first round what they get um-hum how about you well i'm uh originally from the Saint Louis area so the only basketball team pro anyway in that part of the country is Chicago so i i do pull for Chicago uh-huh uh i mean of course this year is a good year to be a a Chicago Bulls fan i guess because they're doing pretty good isn't the the Bulls you're talking about yeah the pro yeah yeah um as far as college teams uh i know it's really easy to say but i've been pulling for uh Duke for about four years now so uh is that right so i finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams although i've i've really you know again being from Saint Louis i pull for Missouri uh but they're on uh probation this year so you can't do much about that uh-huh no no but um so did you watch the uh final four this year oh yeah i watched every uh i watched all three games of that and uh i was very pleased with all three games because Kansas uh you know i was pulling for Kansas on the other side so it was it was real nice to have the the teams that were there every game right right of course i wasn't really i mean i i UNLV kind of gave me the impression of being a uh um oh i don't know a macho team you know they just didn't seem they seemed to think they were better than everybody else and and maybe they were but um i was real happy to see them get knocked off so yeah that i i watched that game um-hum and uh it was a good game it was a very close game and hard fought game oh yeah and it just i don't know it looked like UNLV may have had more uh talent but as far as playing together as a team that day it didn't Duke seemed to have them off balance yeah um-hum and that uh they didn't just couldn't aren't aren't they more of a running gun team UNLV yeah their their they play the pro style is the way i've always called it and uh you know the fast breaks and and right fast breaks and things and they shut all that down and made them pay half court it seemed and right and uh UNLV wasn't used to that of course i've i knew whenever UNLV went in at half time see i don't know if they were necessarily behind but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are and what right uh and you know that meant that they had to play a second half and they've not they've not had to do that all year and uh right right they didn't have they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year and that and that and so that's the you know it's a terrible time to have to deal with one right in it when when it counts so much yeah that's right i mean Duke's schedule was was so much harder than UNLV's that it uh it just made them a much tougher team overall and uh that had to help them a lot right i think i think that that probably was the difference in that game because it really could have gone any either way down to the end you know um-hum so do i take it you think though that the Lakers will uh will win or well i don't know i mean Portland's pretty good um probably not since Kareem's retired yeah they haven't had a center and uh they've got Perkins yeah but i don't think he's really been a super star for them no well he's uh i don't i he to me is not a center he's more of a a real tall forward uh and yes it's right right so i think Magic does a i uh they'll make it you know i it's it's it's going to be a war between uh between Chicago and uh and uh and uh Boston Celtics oh yeah that's going to be a war it's going to be a great series that sure is if i think that's going to be one of those that's uh that's won by the home team you know whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one i think uh-huh one of those two will probably be um in there um let me see where does Detroit fit in Detroit's in that same uh that that same uh division uh-huh so i don't know those three uh Detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year no but as i heard Isaiah came back this week so uh that might help them uh-huh yeah they have the they have the play-off experience well so does so does Detroit i mean so does Chicago oh yeah so do they all three of them do with Larry Bird back uh you can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird's oh yeah that's true uh starting to click on all cylinders they say he's starting to do starting to play um-hum he's yeah but he's been kind of up and down all year uh you know one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in and then the next time he'll you know he can't seem to hit the side of a barn so i don't know i'm i'm kind of i'm not sure about him this year right right right last i've heard is that he's starting to peak right now um-hum well that's when you do it and he's starting to be more consistent you know right at the right time of the year yeah oh oh any any dark horses i you know well the dark horse yeah that's San Antonio San Antonio the dark horse that could could really flip in there i think somewhere yeah anybody who has Davi d Robinson got to have a chance anyway yeah he's got to be pretty much you know i use to say Akeem Olajuwon was the dominant player you know when against any team he would dominate but um-hum Robinson's getting up there where that's right every game he's just i mean it looks like he's going in for a dunk and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back you know nobody's um-hum got enough beef i guess to challenge him when he's when he's driving hard to the hoop hum he's uh he too bad the Mavericks couldn't get him yeah that's true with Roy Tarpley they're in big trouble yeah well then he's gone now so they're going to have to do something about that well i thought he was gone period i i didn't read the story but i i read that uh yeah for awhile anyways i heard he was suspended well that might have been what it was but i i guess the headlines said something about him you know that the Mavericks you know released him or something i'm maybe i misunderstood what they meant because of his um if they did they'd still have to pay his contract well yeah they may have done it you never know yeah but it was a lot of money he was making like i heard on the radio it was sixty three thousand and change a month that's what he was being paid you know he wasn't even playing yeah oh boy what a good job he had that's what i think he ruined ruined his sweet position yeah yeah i'm looking forward to the the pro play-off uh yeah it's coming up isn't it yeah LA yeah San Antonio who's the other one that's doing so well this year Portland is that Portland Portland i haven't seen them on much TV at all much at all but all i you do is hear about boy they have the scene the you know what do they have Walter Davis and Portland yeah Portland um-hum they've got two the two Johnson brothers or they're not brothers but i mean there's two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good doing good or something i forget exactly how that worked but yeah um-hum um they're like i said they're doing extremely good right now Phoenix isn't doing too bad so it's it ought to be a real interesting play-off yeah right right yeah yeah i don't i don't think there's any clear pick that you know um-hum i guess i guess the two teams that i just you know think you can't count out are the are the Celtics and the well because of Bird and and Lakers because of Magic Johnson they they're two guys that seem to find a way when there's when there's when it's on the line they seem to find a way um-hum when it's on the line um-hum you know uh so those are what makes makes a champion i guess yep that's true yeah well it's been nice talking to you all right well take care bye well nice talking to you take care bye  Colorado Springs oh right up in uh TI out there yeah oh right did you hit one yeah i just hit one then all right uh the savings and loan scandal it i got to uh this is going to be fun are you Republican or Democrat uh kind of neither okay well i'm a i'm a Democrat so i was going to say if you're a Republican boy we would really have a good time i do have some Republican leanings because i am division one you know well i uh to answer that one before we get to our subject you know i always get a kick out of Republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was though when it comes to the budget they say well the Democrats control all the money and they're the ones wasting all the money and i always wondered how they can play the money either way they want you know i get a kick out of that but anyway the subject go ahead you first uh i think it's a stinking shame that that there isn't capital punishment for those assholes that stole our money yeah i uh i don't think it's over i think that uh so many other things have taken over uh in the media but i think it was just plain greed and i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks go ahead loan your money out you know i agree with you i think it had something to do with deregulation but i believe uh more of it was just greed yeah i was talking to someone i can't remember who it was but he was a small businessman and he said that the banks were calling he borrowed some money and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away they just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property and uh yeah there there should be thousands of people in jail as far as i'm concerned well not just a couple you know we've watched and watched TV and seen that a lot of these people were doing things not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit but financing the same property three and four times right you know and the list goes on and on well i i agree a hundred percent you know of of just the crimes committed oh yeah much less for criminals that should be indicted it may have started with HUD too i noticed that HUD was in terrible shape and that was property and uh they lost a lot of money there and then some of these big these rich people started to even uh Murchison here who owned the Cowboys had a lot of property down in Florida this was several years ago and he lost you know all all of his money before he died yeah not all of it i don't know how much he lost but uh they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit and it always would it always would increase you know it always would uh uh be more than what you paid for it and they just never even got conservative with our money at all yeah it everyone forgets whose money it was right and everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny American word yeah i i as far as being a Republican or a Democrat i think no American could stand for criminal action well now the reason that i said that is because i was going to blame all uh Reaganomics for you know you spend your way to prosperity and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls i thought well that was the philosophy you know just keep spending until taxes are lower and i thought that's not going to work you know and i knew that it wasn't going to work originally well and it hasn't worked now you know in theory in theory a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on right no doubt no doubt and and if people are making money people can spend money and it'll generate taxes oh yeah i i i agree with that but there's got to be some control and apparently there was you know well the problem is and the problem with Reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich yeah and for what they would cost and we weren't producing anything yeah we as Americans weren't producing anything it was all inflation yeah and i'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it we agree too closely but yeah i know uh but you you can't say that that was right oh no i no intelligent person can say that we could spend our way rich right remember all we're doing is delivering pizzas to each other and and not high quality ones at that you know yeah well well i do have a lot of confidence in the the American people and the economy and everything else i i feel bad when i see the inefficiency even here at TI you know and i think that the it it still a lot of the workers don't understand that uh they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them you know it is a life and death struggle with Japanese with the Japanese right i know and i when i of course i'm in facilities and i work with a lot of mechanics and i just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce you know and they think that well i'm paid anyway so it doesn't matter you know i i'm very tired of it all pays by the hour right right uh and i'm nonexempt yeah oh really you don't sound like a nonexempt Jim is so what you don't sound like a nonexempt what what does a nonexempt sound like uh you're too informed they're they're very they're very uh not interested they wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're talking about now uh i guess i'm dealing with too many Texas mechanics here i don't know really i'm being a Yankee i guess i'm i'm letting my Yankee come out you know uh that's well i now maybe i'm not the uh typical nonexempt that you deal with the badge is silver yeah and uh i am degreed though nonexempt uh well that's good no that's not good but no right i mean that's good that you're degreed uh uh your time will come we uh i know a few people no i i do not wish my time to come oh really what are you in a tech like do you do technician work or something oh no no no i government tool control is my specialty now i did PC protection control work for uh oh quality okay ten or twelve years uh right now i'm just trying to tool crib and hauling chips yeah times are bad oh yeah well now is is uh really terrible i'm uh management level uh facilities and when the cuts came three of us got uh bounced back and so we're just uh i'm calling you from work i'm i'm covering uh weekends and nights now i'm i'm one of the manager reps there's three of us to cover in Dallas facilities and just we're essentially standby and problems uh all all nights and weekends that's my i only get one weekend off a month right now i call it my recession job it's uh being basically an engineer and liking uh doing installation work well there's not any i mean there literally is no installation work going on they turned all installation up here off yeah they told facilities they could not work yeah i don't care what the jobs are you will not work yeah it it and and as far as our you know our conversation goes i would really be interested to know how much of TI's problems now are related to banking the banking structure i think that not not only TI but a lot of it when they talk about uh there was one point i was going to make i think the last i heard and i i have to admit i'm not as informed uh that much but there's something like about eighty six billion that they admit well i always double that i figure well if they claim that it's going to cost us eighty six billion it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes and so if that's true it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that was that went down the tube somewhere i it really hurts me yeah it's amazing really it's amazing that to realize that a lot of people out there are trying to retire on their home values oh yeah i know what you mean uh one of our senior course your value of homes up there are pretty good i mean here they're not really that high but are they pretty good up there no oh really our economy in Colorado Springs fell completely apart well we're in the metroplex here you know and uh it it i die every time companies like General Dynamics they they lost several contracts and and i don't know if you noticed yesterday right you probably don't pay attention to the Bell Helicopter you know they were going to have big uh award and Secorski got it which was Boeing Secorski this which is up in the north somewhere you know yeah it's northwest Seattle Seattle and also uh they do some of that in Wichita Kansas and i don't know how Bell didn't get it well i i don't they were advertising here that it was Bell TI TI was getting the uh electronics with Bell and so it was a double one that Bell is in the Metroplex and two that TI was doing the electronics for them huh and they they advertised that that it was TI Bell TI Bell and then all of a sudden Secorski got it yeah Secorski Boeing Boeing doesn't need the money Secorski Boeing something i almost think there's some politics around here because the metroplex here in the Dallas Fort Worth area the uh with TI i don't know if TI has lost as much as everybody else but General Dynamics and LTV and Bell have lost project after project you know well you realize  okay do have yep are you there okay okay there okay had to mess with my phone here um do you have children yes i have one oh okay i have three yeah yeah uh do you work how about you oh my goodness yeah i do i do i work and and uh Brian's in a day care center he's uh he was two in December so he's not quite two and a half yet he uh i put him i'm okay oh uh-huh kind of had different different ideas from what probably the majority of people have i put him in a day care center from the very beginning he started in day care when he was eight weeks old uh-huh oh no kidding and i just i don't know i have kind of the opposite opinion of most people i have had this real problem with a a private individual i mean i i kind of looked at it like really uh-huh if you take him to a home with a with private individual when the door shuts yeah that one person has total control and i always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around and if you get one bad apple there's are at least other people that can see it they can watch and i just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less yeah yeah yeah yeah um-hum because there's you know how can you help depending on the day care center you know you got to yeah when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers have you ever noticed they're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it you know kind of thing i mean it's it's a it's like a family thing yeah yeah you never hear about it really in the big ones so that's what i did and i have had just excellent luck i have been just so happy he's yeah oh good oh good i was just going to ask you how it you know if you liked the the but obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there i know but right right well he was in he was in the same center for two years for the first two years and uh it was wonderful and i loved it and i was so happy there and the woman who owned it sold it uh-huh yeah oh gosh but i thought okay i'm going to keep an open mind here and the people who came in it just wasn't it just wasn't the same and their their attitude and philosophy was just completely opposite from mine and i right wasn't the same uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh left him there for about a month and just decided i can't do this anymore and i moved him which was an extremely traumatic experience but but he's done well he's been there a couple of months now and i just feel so lucky yeah yeah was it yeah good oh good that's great that's good well i got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years my oldest one is ten and a half now how about you do you work or do you get to stay home with them wonderful or she's i guess yeah it's was about ten years so i yeah i i was really happy that i was able to do that but i that's what i wanted to because i uh you know i just couldn't wait to have kids and so if i was i was so anxious to have them and i couldn't wait to have them it would be kind of silly you know to go back to work as soon as i had them so so it it it it was really great by the end of the ten years i was really ready right right yeah i bet to go back to work and my youngest was only uh two and a half i mean she was already two and a half so it wasn't you know she wasn't an infant uh-huh uh-huh he didn't leave the baby yeah yeah yeah so i felt real good about that but uh boy i tell you with summer coming up i'm just pulling my hair out in terms of what i'm going to do i i guess i went back to work about a year and a half ago and uh i worked full time all last year and now i'm going to school part time and uh graduate school and i'm working part time and so i'm still yeah i'm still going full time but i only have half time salary i know how it goes uh-huh yeah and uh when school lets out i just don't i haven't i have no idea what i'm going to do because i certainly can't afford what we did last year right right did you have them in a center or something last summer which was well we did we tried we had all different things we sent them to camp one first month in June they went to summer school then the second month they uh one my daughter went home to visit my Mom for a while and my son uh went to camp and there we had uh i don't know some forget what else we did but it was all uh really expensive yeah that stuff is expensive it really is so now they're a year older and i my daughter's eleven going to be eleven this summer and my son will be nine and a half and so i'm not i think i can leave them home for a if i can work part of the day you know i'm going to leave them home right are these yeah yeah i was going to say they're getting to the age where you should be able to trust that a little bit yeah right yes in fact i'm doing that right now with their afternoons when they get home before i do you know that's okay but the four year old now i have i have had her since i went back to work or before i went back to work really in a home day care uh-huh situation and uh we've just been really thrilled with it too we were what actually we it took us two or three different people to find to find the right one that's what we have to do though yeah right but i wasn't embarrassed to shop around you know so the the person we found it through the there's an association here in town of professional home care providers or something like that in Plano no no where do where do you live Plano okay yeah and they have a number you can call and all these people are registered with their association and you know go like our our uh i don't want to call her a baby sitter she's doesn't like to be called that care provider care provider right she goes to seminars and uh she gets home visitations by this state uh uh i don't know the state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association and they oh that's wonderful have weekly meetings and everything and so it's just really really well regulated that's great and she's just great in fact uh she's all upset because Galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall and she says this is it you know i'm not going to have her anymore and i said oh no don't count on that after noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning kindergarten so right right but we we've tried we've tried everything and one year i guess last year when i went back to work i had my son was eight at the time just barely eight and uh we put him in Amrein's Day Care after uh-huh i've heard that they were very good after well that's why we picked it because they were were supposed to be real great and you know i think they were fine but the thing is he was in school all day uh-huh in second grade in in Plano it's open classroom situation where they don't have walls so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders uh-huh oh in the same area with no walls and uh and then he'd get on the Amrein's Bus to go to Amrein's and then there would be a whole ton of other kids all in the same room you know you know what fun they had with these computer games and then they'd go outside for awhile they had snacks and story time and everything but it was just like going to school until five thirty at night yeah poor kid was in school all day yeah yeah instead of being able to get home at two thirty yeah because he was always around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed being able to be by himself and having some peace and quiet or you know uh-huh uh-huh even at that age they need that time we all need that time yes yeah just some quiet time to wind down from the day right that's exactly it so another thing that we tried to do i i know your son's too young right now but we're trying we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and stuff like that and yeah yeah i think that's really important and we've already started about you know i mean how young can they start T ball and soccer you know i mean i just you know we both think of that that as just so important to get him involved in stuff like that and yeah right right yeah it is it is and you could hardly wait i mean he's he's so much fun now he's really he's really starting to get lots of fun and i can't wait until stuff like that starts happening you know and you know we did the Easter egg hunts which was really the first year he was really able to yeah i bet yeah uh-huh and to know what we want know what he was doing you know and enjoy it and it was so much fun and gosh he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant and God he got up on this elephant all by himself and Lord i couldn't believe it they had so much fun yeah right oh my gosh you are kidding you're kidding oh that's great i bought us tickets and stood there in line and i thought i'm going to end up on this elephant with him you know he did it by himself so stuff like that is starting to come along where it's really getting fun you know but well good for him uh-huh uh-huh yeah day care has just done just incredible stuff with him and he like comes home with something new everyday you know and so I know i know they're working with him and he's well that's great that's so good excited to get there in the morning and just doesn't even want to kiss me good-bye it's just like bye and he goes running you know and he's always having fun when i pick him up so you know yeah this this day care is is uh-huh he's out of there yeah uh-huh it's Bright Steps in Louisville and whenever you say Bright Steps everybody goes oh i've heard that's the best day care in town you know and it's it's one of those that's very hard to get into and they have uh-huh yeah good uh-huh this this this woman owns three day cares two in Lewisville and one in Irving and she had to open the second one up in Lewisville because her waiting list was just like uh-huh uh-huh you know like a year old it was ridiculous and she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other yes so its i mean she's oh my gosh no kidding she knows something right that she needs if she knows what she's doing all the teachers like about half the teachers are degreed teachers and oh it makes a huge difference yeah that makes such a difference that's the way it is at my daughter's nursery school too and i think that really makes a difference they're in it because it's a profession not because it's a job they could get because they didn't qualify for anything else you know uh-huh yeah that's right that's right that's right and his old day care as much as i loved it you know and the owner i really liked her and she worked really hard to get good people but the people that she got uh-huh yeah uh-huh were there because they weren't qualified to do anything else you know and and i got lucky and all of his teachers were very good uh-huh right because because right some sometimes that's fine that's great you know sometimes it isn't you just have to well is it real expensive then yeah but then sometimes you know yeah um it just went up the first of this month i'm paying uh seventy nine dollars a week for now uh-huh wow yeah so it's a little high but but it's you know it's like where he was before i was only paying sixty three so there's quite a little jump there but i looked all over Louisville right right i looked in every day care there was in Louisville and you know and there were places that were cheaper but is it uh-huh no yeah you know your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money you know and i have peace of mind where he is and some of those other places i wouldn't have yeah uh-huh that's exactly it see we do the same thing since Galen goes to nursery school we pay our our home care provider for our day care provider full time for a whole week but she she's gone three mornings Galen just doesn't go there three mornings a week but i said to her i said you know it doesn't matter if yeah for whatever reason when school holidays come around i used to have such a problem with that they wouldn't have anything to do i'd either have to uh-huh uh  well um yes let me see let me see uh interesting subject i was i was a law student for a year and a half so i've got uh slight bit of expertise in that area not much well explain this to me i okay why do we have sometimes a petit jury isn't it um-hum and a grand jury uh okay it depends on the kind of action it is and also depends on the state um you don't have to have a jury of twelve and that's true in just about all states um it just depends on which ever state statue governs on the uh selection of juries now the the term petit usually applies applies to grand juries you have a uh a grand jury and a petit grand jury um sometimes in some states they also call a uh less than twelve member jury a petit jury uh did that sufficiently confuse you all right now when do we have them just in criminal big criminal cases um uh when when do you have what a jury when you have both like i was called for a murder trial a few weeks ago um-hum and they had had already had one trial and determined that there was enough evidence to go on and have the second one um okay so is it just murder or what where you have both uh okay i i still i still don't get it both what both juries uh at the same time no they didn't have they had had one oh okay yeah and decided that there was enough evidence and then okay uh well well what they do is on a criminal indictment first they go to the grand jury okay the grand jury will either indite or not once a person is indicted then they generally have an evidentiary hearing um and it's strange strange that there would have been a jury there because evidentiary hearings are usually are just before the judge now it's possible they had another trial in which now i i i don't know enough about it to to really to really say uh uh say how long did the other trial go do you know huh-uh i don't know and like you said maybe it was just with the judge i don't know yeah yeah yeah uh the thing is in almost almost every case when there's a question about uh the evidence against the the person there's there's what's called an evidentiary hearing and the both sides get up there and the judge decides whether or not the evidence is good yeah and if the evidence is good then they go ahead and go to trial so you were probably probably being tapped for the jury for the trial yeah well i'll tell you something i think ought to be changed what's that well they sent out eight hundred summons um-hum and about four hundred people showed up right all the others had gotten out of it um-hum um-hum then the judge went on for several hours explaining to us how the law goes um-hum and some of the particulars of the case and then all these people got to stand up if they wanted to get out of it well that was about half of us right stood up and tried to get out um-hum well i mean that took like an hour and a half at least for him to listen to everybody um-hum and then he he didn't let hardly let anybody off you know it was just like we wasted a prayer i didn't go up there because i knew i didn't have a leg to stand on um-hum yeah well it's it's hard to get out of jury duty i mean it's uh it's an obligation on on each citizen and short of uh any of the special circumstances then they generally won't let you out yeah i've been getting out of it the last few years because i was going to school um-hum you know you can plead that and i had small children but then i found out that you're not supposed to plead that unless you're the care taker you know and i'm not because i have to go to work and then they were going to day care so i shouldn't have been doing that right uh yeah but anyway well as long as they didn't question you too closely i mean the thing is uh the easiest way to get out of one of these things is uh uh uh they'll ask you questions like do you know the defendant have you heard anything about the case do you have any uh specially if it's a murder case they may be asking for uh for a capital uh a capital's capital punishment punishment um-hum uh you can always say that you object to that and they'll let you off there well i certainly i believed in it in some situations you know cases but i would feel that it would be very hard for me to impose it on somebody yeah uh that i think yeah that's that won't get you off that you you have to be you have to be dead set against it okay um the fact that you're willing the fact that you believe in it doesn't uh doesn't matter of course they're going to ask you can do you think you could impose it in this case um-hum and you know i that that to me that's always been a stupid question i i mean i don't know i haven't heard the evidence yet um-hum i mean if if if he did something really really gross then yeah well this guy that was sitting in in front of me said that he was a private investigator and he had been tailing the woman that was murdered and as far as he was concerned that this guy was guiltier than hell now listen to what he supposedly did he supposedly stuffed paper toweling up this women's nostrils and down her throat and strangled her ugh now how this happened was this rich little socialite in Plano down here in Texas decided that she was going to bump off her husband's girlfriend because he didn't want to divorce her oh God and she wanted to get a stab at more money right by knocking him off yeah right so she hired four guys to do it and this guy actually did it oh God now she uh in the mean time took off with one of her lawyers who was also under indictment for attempting drug among them they ought to make this into a TV show yeah among them cocaine right so they split anyway they got the lawyer and he's now going to side with the cate with the state so that he'll get a lesser sentence yeah he's going to turn states evidence yeah God pretty interesting huh now that that would have been fun to sit in on well now they're going to call people up after they've gone through this five page thing that we had to fill out um-hum and decide to call in people two to three at a time um-hum they're going to do this let's see all through April and May and the trials not supposed to start until June well that's the beginning of my vacation um that i don't want to be picked nothing like taking your vacation what you ought to do is reschedule your vacation real quick i can't i'm a teacher it's then or never oh yeah um gosh anyway what a way to spend your your vacation i'm not going to be summoned i mean out of four hundred i'm not going to be one of the twelve especially see i put that down that that guy had told me that but then i've heard that won't make a difference either yeah that that's well it may because it it's something that could have influenced your your your uh uh your uh your bias yeah so well there's a good chance if they if they ask you about it you know i would i wouldn't just come out and say i think the guys guilty but i i would say that i've heard enough about this that i i really have a preconceived notion of of what the guy did uh-huh and i think that you know in in other words if you if you can just show that you're not going to be that you can't be uh unbiased that's going to be enough well what do you think can we change the system well there's been all kinds of talk about it but quite honestly i don't think there's anything else that we could put in place that would work as well i mean i i realize it's cumbersome and uh uh it's time consuming and at times even ridiculous but it the that nobody's come up with any better solution but something ought to be done because if you have money you get a good lawyer and you get off well that that is that's a that's one of those things i think's sort sort of a preconceived notion on the part of the public they you can have a whole bunch of money and you can have the best lawyers but you you know if you've got if you've got a reasonable jury who will look at the evidence i mean you see that's what it all comes down to it's the jury uh if they are i mean there's no doubt that you you can pick a jury okay in some in some respects you can get the kind of jury you want but short of that i mean if people are reasonable and they'll look at the evidence and decide on that basis then then you know supposedly money doesn't count but on the other hand what can you do about it i mean what what solution is there but if you've got a good lawyer he's going to be able to get more persuasive evidence than a poor lawyer would to present and a lawyer that's you know chosen by the state that really doesn't even want to do it uh oh you mean a court appointed lawyer uh-huh yeah there's there's little doubt that i mean obviously a court appointed lawyer doesn't have the time or the resources to do as much but on the other hand i mean again what what can be done about it you know it's it's one of those i i think unsolvable sort of things i mean we we make the motions of  uh so you have children i take it no i don't you don't no huh-uh so it's not a very valid topic no it's not do you have children uh yes uh-huh one one stepdaughter uh-huh ten ten and uh you know how they are at that age i guess you having been ten once yeah once upon a time i was well i have two dogs those are my kids yourself oh we have one what kind is it uh Keeshonden oh really yeah fuzzy little thing uh-huh a what a fuzzy little dog yeah yeah they're cute rather rather odd personality he he he's fun uh-huh anyway uh time we spend with our children um-hum it seems almost as though children hate it do they yes time spent with mom and dad is uh next is that's probably one of the worst punishments on earth to them yeah especially when they get like into the teenage stage and yeah i guess i yeah i remember when i was that age they you know parents are a curse that they just have to live with uh-huh so it it's interesting yeah we do spend time driving in the mountains uh-huh oh how nice i would love to live up there no do you work for TI uh-huh uh-huh you're working then yeah with every passing day we wonder if we will be that's what i heard i've always thought about maybe transferring up there and i thought if i do that i might not have a job so it's it's better to to be employed um-hum um-hum especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner um-hum i know it and that creates family tensions yeah yeah i'm sure it does so you only have the you only have the stepdaughter at home you all don't have any other children around there yes no no i don't have any any children uh-huh so how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all uh well it varies what it is of course but usually mom and dad are a curse um-hum um-hum you know they they'd much rather be with friends friends are cool parents aren't oh yeah no huh-uh but i remember well i'm sure part of it is a male female thing you know i i remember whenever i was growing up um-hum often times spent with my Dad was oh just wonderful you know go uh-huh go hunting or go to the races or um-hum or oh any number of things um-hum and we'd have um great times oh yeah and it seems that well now the bank's not available yeah and entirely too much time is spent my wife and i were wondering what if um-hum and and what if's always rough oh yeah yeah but you know we do have our trips and we do have our fun and um-hum i don't know little girls aren't interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were like fishing and hunting and and yeah looking for arrowheads and my husband'll say that he'd like to have a little boy to take hunting and fishing and i'd say well you can take a little girl hunting and fishing just as easily uh but they don't like it that's probably right there there there is a difference there um-hum um-hum and the and yeah well if my dad had done that when i was a kid i probably wouldn't have liked it i go now with my husband and i enjoy it but well girls at that age um-hum video games boys and malls yeah yeah not necessarily in that order and friends of course uh-huh and that's a little tough for fathers um-hum i imagine fathers don't even like malls they despise shopping uh so is that quality time huh no i think not yeah if but there is camping and we both enjoy that uh-huh she likes to do that somewhat yeah yeah yeah yeah well that's good getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all and uh-huh that's somewhat fun um-hum it's she huh so what do you think about child rearing is how how would you spend time with kids probably doing outdoorsie stuff and keep them trying to keep them away from the TV i guess and McDonald's i i've always said that if i had a kid they wouldn't know what McDonald's is oh yeah but i guess they learn from their friends don't they yeah but well yeah and amazingly a lot of times it's real easy uh-huh you know a lot of times whenever we head out of town on a trip or something um-hum it's real easy to swing in there for breakfast yeah breakfast and run and yeah breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway yeah and uh it is kids eat funny this lady in our bass club we had a tournament yesterday and she was talking about her daughter said one week her daughter won't uh will be on a no meat kick and one week she'll eat nothing but Twix candy bars you know it's she just eats weird and little girls are worse about it than little boys yeah yeah they they're always wanting to go on a diet or something or or something yeah go on a diet or they um-hum they have a well to some extent the public schools or the schools in general um-hum influence them um-hum the eating meat kick yeah you know it like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something i i'm not sure um-hum of course that's not the way i was raised being raised in West Texas yeah oh is that where you're from oh yeah um-hum born in Denton raised in Lubbock oh so i understand about bass um yeah uh but it but it is interesting um-hum i i will tell you yeah every person out there should have kids at least once or or have some that they can borrow for a time that's the kind i like because everyone needs some torture in their lives my mother used to put that curse on my sister i hope you have kids just like yourself and my grandmother must have put that on my dad because he got my sister she's just like him uh but Jenny is a sweet kid yeah i'm sure she is and and yeah we do do things and yeah it it's funny it's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children um-hum to go do um-hum the money's not available um-hum i know i don't know how people can afford kids you know i mean what we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land uh-huh golly a couple three hundred dollars oh yeah you know for just just a day not including you know a day or two not including lodging and food and all that uh-huh uh-huh it's i don't see how anyone can afford it oh and i understand Six Flags is real expensive now it's uh i heard it's twenty bucks a whack for adults oh yeah yeah that is awful high oh twenty bucks a whack now yeah or twenty one but at least once you pay your way in there at Six Flags uh-huh yeah everything's free except for the food and stuff yeah yeah food and junk to carry out so that's that's not as bad yeah yeah but golly you know Disney World or Disney Land uh-huh well our problem is that you know a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or uh Disney Land or God forbid Disney World would take forever really or you'd have to pay air fare and uh-huh oh for a family you know for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick and rent a car when you get there and all that yeah oh yeah that's why i lucked out my dad worked for Braniff when i was a kid so we got you know our air fare free and we got discounts  hello hello hi uh my name's Nicole hi Nicole i'm Mary Ann uh where are you Mary Ann uh i'm in McKinney oh you're i'm in Dallas not very long distance i see okay no not at all and yet long enough if we were calling back and forth it would be a toll call it would yes it would okay are you uh do you know about the topic uh if if i understood correctly it was what what changes we might uh suggest or whatever for the justice system is that perhaps above my head yeah uh justice system or and what we think about the uh judge changing it to so the the judge would do the conviction or no sentencing sentencing sentencing and would all the jurors have to agree on okay that'd be a good place to start okay all right i'm going to push one all right have you ever served on a on a jury trial yes one time one time but we found him innocent so uh was it was it a criminal yes it was this guy bit another guy's finger off okay oh oh but he deserved it i probably would have bit his finger off too if he was trying to strangle me or beat me up you know if i could have gotten his hand in my mouth i'd have bit him just like this guy did he was scared he was a kid oh my you know and the guy was trying to beat him up this older teenager was shacking up with this guy's ex-wife or something they were uh uh huh they were really in a mess and there were children involved and it was just terrible but i didn't think anybody you know they all deserved to go to jail not just the one guy you know uh it really does sound like it was a self defense kind of thing it really was he was trying to beat him up so you know we found him innocent so i really don't know what happens after you find them guilty i thought that the judge did do the sentencing no i served on on both a criminal and a a civil um jury and in my criminal trial he pled guilty um to the first to to kidnapping and so we went through the second part of the trial because in Texas there are two parts first of all to find if they are guilty or innocent he already said he's guilty so then then we go through the trial to determine what uh punishment should be meted out oh so we still went through three days of of uh testimony and so forth and and witnesses saying oh he's an upstanding young man just weak and was led by another guy and so forth so we were the ones that that came up with the sentence and the judge gave us some parameters and said you know according to the law it can be no more or no less uh no more or less than and he gave the the number of years and he said it would also include a a possible fine up to ten thousand dollars and and we had that's that took us six hours just to agree on what we thought was appropriate for this young man good grief that would be hard to do you know um it wasn't the easiest thing i've done but no nor was it hard to to us the young man had kind of taken care of it when he said he was guilty so we did not yeah we didn't have to struggle at all with that it was now what's fitting and and we'd gone through you know all that so i i don't know i thought that was easier than than trying to decide his guilt or innocence yeah yeah whether he's guilty or not yeah that's true i i probably would not mind letting the judge do the sentencing as long as the jury of of peers were determining guilt or innocence for one thing we didn't know that the others involved in the trial had uh or i or i mean had i mean involved in the crime had already come up for trial we couldn't know what had come of their uh sentencing um-hum and and we couldn't know that until after we'd made our findings so it turned out we had done about what the other juries had done and so it you know we felt a little better but i think if that could be in the hands of of someone who knew the law and could be privy to that information seems like it would be fairer is it different in different states do you know since it's state uh laws yes because i know on some at times the news you know and they say the judge gives the sentencing and so that's what i guess i thought it was that way everywhere being as i hadn't been all the way through you know anything like that it now now it may be on some Federal Laws you know it it this was a we were dealing with uh with the state laws not necessarily not necessarily federal that may have something to do with it and it may be too that if it were um a capital crime state yeah uh capital murder or something like that that it may be different yeah well i wouldn't oh that would be hard yes it would it would be hard to sentence somebody to death if you weren't really really really sure you'd have to be really really really sure that he did it i mean really sure well i had a friend who sat in on a or who was on a jury recently for a murder but the man was not being tried for capital murder and so that was not even an option uh the death penalty was not an option so and in in this case everyone on the jury felt that it should have been and they were very convinced the man had no redeeming uh qualities and couldn't be rehabilitated and they were they were really upset that he was getting off so lightly for the heinous crime that he had been involved in oh i'm real glad that i don't that i don't work in that kind of a uh a background background i'll take my job any day yeah think of the pressures you know i don't work with perfect people anymore than anybody else does but i can handle the imperfections that i'm around i i could not work in the in the uh criminal area for very long as a as a police officer as uh someone who works for the court system or whatever yeah so anyway back to the original question i really think i if if we were still allowed to choose guilt or innocence well i'd be more than happy to let the judge determine the uh the sentencing the sentencing yeah i agree i agree with you right i do agree with you i i figure that it's been a couple of years now since i've served now so i'm i've been looking lately for mine it's about time for me to get called up down there again um so i enjoy doing it i do too as long as i get paid well now before i worked for TI and i didn't get days uh time off for jury duty you know it was difficult oh i bet because there are a lot of places that don't give you time i mean they give you the time but not the pay i see okay so you know you lose a day's pay and you well you make about eight dollars or whatever it is you know big deal oh you make eight dollars now in Dallas County huh it's only seven fifty here in Collin i think it's eight it might i i don't remember it probably is which is about what it costs you to park your car right well they send you a free bus ticket and i use it oh do they oh okay so you know i come out pretty good on it i mean i get and plus my TI money i come out real good on it now the last one i served on i was working at TI and so i got time off for it but i was working third shift and that made it a little difficult yeah oh to decide yeah i i can see how that would be difficult yeah to decide which day to take off and you know do you take off the day before you go oh that would be tough after you go or before you go so it was tough so but anyway well i don't have much more to say about it um what about the other suggestion that they had that uh about the jury all the jury agreeing on the sentencing do you feel that that is a requirement i think if anybody has a doubt you need to yeah i do feel that yes i really do that there there should be agreement agreement yeah i think i do too because someone might see something that you don't see i mean you know they may have they may have picked up on something that gave them that doubt that um-hum you know yeah i really think everybody needs to agree it's it's it's so easy anyway for everybody to just kind of become a yes man and get carried up along with the emotions and so if there's somebody who's strong enough to stand up with a specific doubt i would a whole lot rather go through the expense of another trial because of a hung jury than that a justice not be meted out correctly yeah so yeah i agree with boy it's really easy to discuss something when you both agree yeah well you know that i mean i uh you have to agree on this almost i would think i can't imagine not agreeing that everybody should agree on a jury i i i don't know on ours when we we all really agreed on this did you all have any disagreements when you were doing the sentencing well it took us six hours to reach agreement yeah i can't remember how many it didn't take us but an hour i think or an hour and a half we were all pretty i think we had one man in there that uh wanted to find him guilty because he kept saying he did it then we kept saying he did it but the other guy you know yeah we had to convince him that um you know that yes he did it but he wasn't guilty he didn't need to go to jail for doing it that was you know he did it he admitted it that he bit that guys finger but he did it in self defense so you know we just didn't feel that he needed yeah apparently you all were successful in uh convincing him at last yes finally we did it didn't take  okay well have you ever had uh had a family reunion oh yes and uh let me tell you this is really neat thing to do too that they did i didn't do it some of the other people the older people organized it and what they did was they had uh a book made up uh-huh oh and it was like when our ancestors first came over no kidding and then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family huh and like how many kids you had and who you had married and you know it went through like and it showed who my uh well who my husband's parents were you know and who he married and then how many children we had and then like his brothers and sisters and it went through the whole family and stuff uh-huh oh that's so neat and it was so good oh great yeah but it it really did you know and plus plus it got a lot more people interested in it because you got to participate sort of um-hum yeah so so did everybody send in their information then they made a book up about it and then you could get it at the reunion right um-hum right and everybody got a book that came to the reunion and it told like uh you know where the first Connally's came over and um oh nice um-hum um-hum it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had and it just kept coming on up through the generations so it was really that was really neat and wow that is neat so do you have a big family well he does he does i don't but uh he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any oh he does yeah that's kind of how my husband and i are i have a kind of a big family and he just has himself and his brother and his parents and that's it so he had to kind of get used to us when we first started going together uh-huh yeah that's what that's what happened when i when i first uh met my husband i said this can't be you know nobody can have this many relatives because a lot of them lived in like a group you know down one highway uh-huh uh-huh and there was a lake and they all lived down there by it oh how nice and so we were going down the highway you know and he kept saying this is where my uncle and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle you know and we and i kept thinking oh my gosh this guy is putting me on nobody has this many relatives you know so but they really were all there and another thing that's real good about um yeah how funny family reunion is having everybody just cook whatever is their specialty and bring it at because nobody it seemed like liked the same thing um-hum um-hum um-hum oh but you had a choice and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too and got get a lot of good recipes where if you set a certain thing and say okay we're going all going to have fried fish or we're all going to have fried chicken yeah yeah yeah yeah everybody might not like that not be able to do it so did people come like from out of town to the reunion or they did did you put them up in other peoples houses or did you have hotel rooms or how'd you do it oh yeah yeah they came from all over um they just stayed with different ones of them they just came down and like say okay this aunt and uncle Kip uh all their kids and their grand kids and everything and then they had it it it gotten so big that they had it at the church they did um-hum um-hum oh really and they had a church service ahead of it you know and then they had uh how nice then they ate out on the ground and they just brought food with them um-hum um-hum did they just have like over a weekend is that how they did it uh-huh well i'm real curious because my family i didn't sound i don't think my family is as big as your husband's i don't think we'd need a whole church but um yeah um-hum the problem is we are all really scattered around there isn't any one place where most of us live so if we ever had a reunion we'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel i mean you know there'd be one person who lived there that would have a house but they couldn't put everybody up so it i think it would get kind of expensive but you know what you can do at a lot of these lakes and things if you could find a centrally located like uh say it's about the same distance for all of y'all to come they have these places where you can rent them um uh-huh and it you know like on a lake and it's like uh it's a big place i mean you know it got and it got little rooms that separate off of it and stuff and it's not very expensive that a way uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh you mean so oh i see so everybody could stay together yeah a house or something right it's like a they have like a a convention type thing and then it has little rooms off of it where you know you'd go and sleep at night time but then it has like a kitchenette and things like that but you uh-huh oh see that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together than if you all were in your own hotels or something and then every time you wanted to go eat right and another with somebody you'd probably have to go to out eat or something it would run into a lot of money so yeah but they had that was you know that that sounds like fun what you can do is you can uh write different places the Chamber of Commerce and tell them what you're interested in and ask them what they have you know at area lakes and all um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah if they have something like that because now every time we plan anything just about we write to the Chamber of Commerce of where we're going because you can find out so much easier that a way than try to locate it you know um-hum you get a yeah calling different places can really really run you up a bill but uh if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance i mean you can't get it exact you know usually yeah oh yeah but uh and then everybody goes that place and me it's not bad at all uh-huh uh-huh but they have lot of times they'll have like uh little cabins and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have you know just the single bunk beds and stuff um-hum uh-huh and they can all stay in those cabins and then you know you can have cookouts and stuff like that that doesn't cost you as much that'd be great that'd be really nice yeah but that's uh you know that's the best way i found because whenever you have something where you go and now we had one yeah that soun d good this was before i lost a lot more of my family but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway because i didn't have any of them left but um they had uh uh uh-huh uh-huh thing where you could everybody could come and meet and go out to eat um-hum but i didn't think that was as good because it was like you know you couldn't really talk and stuff like you could when you was at the lake or somewhere you know where you were out this was like ev erybody came into town and went to this restaurant yeah yeah yeah yeah right and you have to sit at a table and just yeah yeah and it just i didn't like that one as well well um did you was it hard to decide what who to invite and who not to invite i mean did you have to draw a line or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line like they just whoever wanted to come no what they did was well see what they did was okay they uh wrote they wrote to all the initial people you know the the oldest ones uh-huh right okay then those in turn got a hold of these other ones and they had like i think there was four or five different people that would call um-hum um-hum um-hum you know some of them if they didn't have their addresses and all on and you know they told them that what we had to do was when we sent back in our information we had to tell them how many people were going to be coming yeah you know and then when they when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter it uh you know to get the information and all it asked you know will you be willing to bring and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring right right uh-huh oh i see and so really there wasn't any problem with that's the reason it ended up in a church because i mean there was just so many of them there yeah yeah but it turned out so much better like that because everybody knew they knew ahead of time how many people to expect yeah right now if there was a sickness or something like that i mean you know you're not going to lose that many sure sure no that would just be a few but how about like because of divorce and stuff like that like my parents are divorced and they're both remarried and you know there i mean there's i don't know right okay well well see then okay if you wanted them both to come then you would put you would have put that down on the list and you would have sent you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them and ask for their information yeah yeah yeah so then i i'm kind of like in control over who comes of just from my family to send back to those other people right because once it went to the the oldest people and then they knew who they wanted to invite then they sent their little things to us okay it was up to me yeah yeah um-hum who i was going to you know whether i wanted my kids and you know my any of my family to come right right i see i see that's a pretty good idea to do it that way so and then you know it never did like if i didn't want somebody to come then i just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires um-hum right right right well that's a real good idea huh so there really wasn't a problem that a way well but i tell you what that's the neatest book we've got course we've got well you know we've still got it and they charged us i think it was like i bet it was like five or six dollars i can't remember exactly you know that we paid for the book to be printed and it's not uh it's not a hard back book it's just a um-hum yeah yeah um-hum oh like a you know folder type thing but it has the entire you know it has everybody that you could ever imagine and some you couldn't uh-huh how neat yeah i know that's really neat that's really neat and it'll be something my kids will have you know just like i was just thinking of that what you could tell your kids yeah because if you stop and think i don't know if you're like me but i know very little about before my grandparents i mean very very little about it um-hum um-hum i just the thing is i know a lot of stories but i can't remember who it was about my grandparents told us when i was growing up and even when i was an adult they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their friends best friends because they all grew up in New York City but i can't you know so i remember these stories but i have no idea who it was that was in those stories yeah so i i mean i couldn't give an accurate i couldn't tell my kids what you know those people were like i just remember they have some funny stories but i don't know who it was maybe what you could do if you couldn't get into a full family reunion and you wanted to go back some but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents um-hum um-hum yeah then you can find out from you know you can find somebody else that can tell you something else about these the rest yeah  okay what do you usually wear to work well uh i am basically retired now i was a member i was in education and in administration so basically i wore uh-huh uh-huh dresses and uh heels and i was never one uh because my work often took me into court uh never was one that got uh accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work uh-huh uh-huh but that was just me i know many people are comfortable very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants uh it i guess i was just old enough not to uh be very comfortable in it how about you uh-huh well i work at TI and they don't really have uh dress code so to speak there it's pretty lax about um you know we you can pretty much wear whatever you want to and i wear anything from jeans when i'm feeling really casual to uh suits and dresses when i'm meeting with a customer or i i teach training classes oh and so when i'm teaching a class obviously i wear a suit or dress so um-hum it it uh definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is and when it's raining i'm more likely to wear jeans and and when it's really cold i'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing um-hum um but it just really depends on the weather and my mood and then you know obviously when i'm doing anything that i'm in front of people or or making presentations teaching whatever i'm going to dress up more yes and i think that does make a difference because when you do have to be in front of people uh i think you the the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and and uh more classical style of clothing uh-huh uh-huh what about the miniskirt there are a few people every now and then that wear those to work there pretty strict about that though um i've never worn i just wouldn't i mean even to well jeans aren't exactly professional but for some reason a mini skirt is to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans just because it's maybe it's just because of the sexist views and everything but you just feel like you're you're being showing too much leg i don't know i wouldn't want to wear a mini skirt to work i have seen a few people do it though but they they weren't overly short and they weren't overly revealing they were pretty much in good taste but um for me i just um-hum for me i just i just couldn't wouldn't want to do that well there are miniskirts and there are miniskirts there are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person yeah uh-huh that's what i've seen uh-huh as well as the shape of the person's legs uh-huh now i also uh even though i retired from education i uh i do modeling and i teach at a modeling agency here uh-huh and uh so when we are doing wardrobing and we have uh two two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the miniskirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job uh-huh uh even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through uh grandmothers uh-huh in my class and uh when i always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad uh-huh because maybe they those are not the clothes that are the most uh appealing to you or the most uh complimentary to you right but uh the miniskirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want right and and then uh then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy uh-huh well i feel like too on the job when you know there's men around and some of the managers are men you just you know you don't want them looking at your legs necessarily and uh to me i just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work that's right well i i uh i have to agree with that even when they was very very popular in the early sixties uh i uh uh-huh uh again maybe because i was at the school there were still many teachers who wore miniskirts uh we had no regulation against it and a lot of the kids did of course and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers uh-huh right because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those miniskirts right and so i think uh uh of course now i go the other extreme i do not like to see in the corporate areas uh all the women dressed like men uh-huh with the suits and uh white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same uh-huh uh i don't like that i don't i think there should be individuality in dressing uh-huh even with the very tailored look of a suit sometimes i like to have something a little just a little something that's feminine yes not you know you don't want to over do it but just a little a touch of it just to say yes i am a woman but i can be professional too right well i and i don't think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to to look professional right uh-huh i think that you you make of that what you wish and you can go the opposite direction and uh overdo all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which don't belong in the uh at least in my opinion in the workplace uh but that that you can have a classical look without a lot of a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine because that was one thing i always fought against i started out as a physical education teacher right uh-huh uh-huh so i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or mannish uh and people would never ever guess that i was phys ed and um and that pleased me right uh-huh uh and uh so then i of course just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work and uh and i find even even at home here now i i will wear blue jeans or i'll wear shorts and what have you uh and be very comfortable but when i go out somewhere then uh unless i have a pair of dress slacks i don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans uh-huh i have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how and so uh uh i just feel that uh you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort uh-huh uh-huh but uh there are certain norms that companies should be able to uh put out as guidelines for their employees right that's what i one thing i like about TI is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear and they don't you know your boss doesn't come up to you and say now remember tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit i mean they they leave it up to you and your judgment to to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have right yes the only real restrictions they have are uh no halter tops and no shorts even the long walking short of the squirts the the split skirts anything that that could be considered shorts they don't allow and they don't allow um yes yes that's good and they don't allow uh any sweat any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar or you know anything like that on it but yeah um-hum other than that it's pretty pretty lax and i think that's good because it does allow people to be individual and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day or you know if you want to be comfortable and casual you can and sometimes i think you yes may be more productive if you're comfortable with what your wearing and can be be feel more relaxed whereas uh right sometimes when your in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and you're not you know maybe you don't uh can't get as comfortable to sit down and you know like when i'm writing training material i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day right right so that's i think that is good that they're like that i do know there's a lot of companies that are very strict about what the employees wear and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and you know no variation and i don't i don't quite agree with that yeah yeah well i don't either unfortunately i don't have to work in those companies but uh i i uh right did have a group come over from one of the banks over the children's hospital where i was volunteering and uh they were doing a presentation and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly alike men and women they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or slacks or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie i mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants uh right and one was a skirt and one was a pant and uh and i think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality yeah uh-huh that's uh can stifle creativity right i agree so well it i guess we've talked probably long enough nice talking to you too i enjoyed it bye-bye i guess so well it's been nice talking with you uh-huh bye-bye  are you in the new car market right now no i'm not uh and i won't be for a while it's kind of called not having the money but i always like to look at what's out there are you looking at cars right now i'm not looking right now but i have been considering what i would purchase uh in the near future what have what are you thinking about um well i'm getting in the in my mid thirties now i'm looking more for a uh kind of a luxury sedan i guess i'm driving a two door coupe sport coupe right now and i'm getting a little tired of it um-hum so you're looking at uh luxury luxury cars a little bit bigger yeah a little bigger and have you looked at uh the Buick Riviera i haven't uh really been out looking at cars uh uh it's something i would possibly consider it is well i happen to drive that one just because i think it looks nice and um i owned a Buick for a while and it it performed real well uh-huh um um i don't i have a lot of friends that have bought cars recently and it just seems like there's and epidemic um a million people who that buy Honda Civic uh Honda Accords its like everybody buys a Honda Accord right and i really don't know what makes them select that over any other car i don't know i've been told to check out the uh Acura Legend first though and i guess they're made by Honda as well that's oh are they i didn't know that i didn't know that it's the uh luxury line of the Hondas i think uh and i uh i've read some articles too about oh i think the last one that got me going i don't know much about it at all but those little Geos uh-huh they're kind of cute and they get excellent gas mileage i mean they're like the top rated gas mileage car out there yeah i do need something that gets a little better mileage than what i'm getting getting right now um-hum i get about thirteen miles per gallon whoa now i've been uh leaning more towards looking at uh Mercedes Benzes say four or five years old oh that sounds nice not the new cars but uh ones that are more affordable um-hum they tend to be very reliable and uh people that uh own them uh typically have them serviced on a regular maintenance schedule i think they're kept in uh better condition than uh most other cars i agree with you there i have uh a friend who has one and you know another thing is is they don't age they always look the same so you really don't know what what year it is uh uh-huh yeah they don't change style very often i like that they don't and uh they you know they're a quality car they uh-huh if you were to buy uh a new car right now what factors would do you consider uh looking at to make you decision well i would definitely have to look at price uh-huh uh and i would look at what i could afford uh i definitely would chose a car on on what appeals to me as far as looks but it'd have to be dependable uh i find that price is always the governing governing governing factor uh regardless of what else you're looking at so it it'd have to be it's difficult to buy something that's out of your price range something that you can't afford exactly and there there's such a range of prices prices in the car market that if you don't start by narrowing it down by that factor i mean that really gets you into just one little slot and then there are many many options to go to go to from there uh i'd one thing that always interests me is whether or not to buy an American car or a foreign car uh-huh well i yeah i drive a Pontiac right now and i've had very good luck with it uh no problems i'm just changing my preference for what type of car i'd like to drive in the future um-hum so you're going to uh something a little bit bigger and and having better gas mileage too yeah eventually i'd like to do something like that uh-huh get out out of uh uh driving this uh teenage teenage automobile well you make me laugh because right now i what i did is i i acquired a car through my folks which is a nineteen eighty four LTD and my teenage daughter hates it because it's an old persons car sure well there are cars that teens absolutely will refuse to drive oh well absolutely and uh it's it's a nineteen eighty four car and it has eighteen thousand miles on it actual miles so it's kind of thing like i'm going to drive this car until it dies you know i mean it's just too good to and then maybe when i go out and look in in the car market i'll be able to get what i really want and uh-huh do you prefer buying uh cars new from uh dealerships or uh buying used cars from individuals oh i think i'm going to fall in to the category of most women uh in saying that i feel better going to a dealership because i don't know anything about a car mechanically right but don't you feel intimidated by talking to a car salesman oh that was an experiment i did last year was i went and and talk and drove a few cars and talked with the the salesman and i found that uh i had matured a little bit in that they don't intimidate me at all okay well that's great if they can make you feel at ease that's pretty good uh oh they well they they make you they don't make you feel at ease but i've come to the point where i know that i'm the one they charge and that they can't you know right talk me into something um i think they're intimidating to both men and women they certainly are and they try to take advantage of uh the consumer's ignorance towards automobiles and exactly and once you once they sense that you really like something then you're really in trouble yeah if they sense that you're really interested and that's the car for you they're when they're negotiating position is that they're going to get as much money out of you as they can um-hum exactly with as many options piled on yeah the uh i had also had a had a nineteen eighty four uh Bronco too which uh my ex-husband had purchased i paid it off and and when i acquired this LTD i thought well i'm going to sell this car while i can get some money out of it yet so i was the selling a car and that was interesting because i had to kind of research well what is it worth um and kind of understand what someone would ask me about it sure well you tend to do a lot better on selling a used car as an individual placing an ad in the paper as opposed to trading it in at a dealership oh yes absolutely and yet at the same time it's it's a matter of like selling anything else you have to find someone who wants that pa rticular item sure well i've found that any car that runs is basically in demand uh-huh uh-huh and uh you can go pretty much by the blue book value or by uh comparison uh listings that's what i did is i kind of did a little bit of both Blue book is kind of a dream it's kind of like if you can attain it you're doing well yeah um-hum but if you go by what the other cars are listing for then you can rest assured that you're going to get right in that ball park Honda so yeah uh yeah i agree with you on that how so how soon do you think you'll be purchasing a car well i'm not sure i'm i'm just uh kind of thinking about it and haven't really made any uh decisions or commitments on it do you think of colors at all when you well i drive a black car right now and i've always liked black but uh i maybe uh interested in other colors uh i'm not really interested in yellow or white uh-huh but i've always had a preference for red uh-huh and black and uh well it's just something i'd have to think about depended on it depends on which uh what cars are available that's right would you order it or would you uh oh no i would uh go to the want ads in the paper and uh find one that would meet my uh needs uh-huh well that sounds exciting it really does so well maybe maybe sometime soon i don't know probably not this year i think i need to concentrate more on getting a paint job for the car that i have right now uh-huh and just keeping it in uh good operating condition well that sounds like a good plan you might as well just you know get it enjoy it for one more year and get it in good shape shape for selling it or trading it in yeah well that's the point it isn't costing me any money right now it's running uh very well and i haven't had car payments for seven years i enjoy that immensely uh-huh my goodness what type of car do you are you driving i'm driving a nineteen eighty Trans AM uh-huh the only trouble i have with it is with insurance companies oh i'm sure they don't want to insure it uh-huh because it has such uh just because it's a sporty model powerful enough right right has nothing to do with driving record i have no accidents or tickets and uh they're very reluctant uh yet even to insure that car uh-huh i can understand that they're i mean they're just very difficult to work with and they can they can see a potential for a problem even if your record is good yeah well my insurance agent told me that uh when when i uh bought a new car or when when i more specifically when i bought my Honda to give him a call because then he would he would make me a good deal on an insurance policy well that's good but i haven't really no intention of buying a Honda they don't really appeal to me that much i it uh well it's it's more like an economy car right right and uh i'd be looking more of uh more for a luxury sedan something with a little more status you seem to put a lot of um image into your selection of a car which lots of people do i really don't consider it to be a status symbol uh it's just i'm interested i know people who have cars of that nature and uh they tend to hold their quality that's true and hold their value uh-huh uh-huh uh and they're just very attractive automobiles as far as i'm concerned and i liked what you said also about when people have cars that are uh that are quality cars  okay Diana uh on capital punishment in our state they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman uh-huh and i believe also in shooting of uh rape i mean killing a rape victim or i mean someone in the process of rape uh-huh uh-huh and i don't know what else i don't really remember what else uh-huh but how do you feel what what do you think about it i think it's justified uh yeah yeah very much so i agree i i agree you know i i think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman yeah oh i do too i do too i mean i think they're doing their duty but i think if they're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it they ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman yeah i agree i don't know i heard something on the news the other night they were talking about that's right i agree uh oh i know what it was it was in our in our little local paper our little Lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week uh there's a little thing at the bottom that it's like a call in survey that says you know do you think so and so and then you call this number and you press like one for yes and two for no right uh-huh and one of the things the questions the other day uh this last paper and i haven't seen the results of it i'm anxious to was do you think that um capital punishment ought to apply to drug dealers oh i think which i thought was a real interesting question right right did you see Sixty Minutes tonight by any chance no i didn't huh-uh well they were showing a segment on a man in Philadelphia that's going after the drug dealers he's just a civilian he's a black man and he just got fed up with it uh-huh uh-huh and he said he's had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything trying to keep keep him quiet but he's organizing people uh-huh and they're going out and marching on the corners and taking taking back their territory you know i think that's what it's going to take though i think so i think i really do i yeah it's going to take uh you know the the police i i think i don't think can do it uh can do it alone you know that's right i think you're right it's going to take uh it's going to take all of us getting together i'm sorry i'm trying to my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed it's going to take all of us you know getting together and just saying we are not going to take it any more right we won't allow this in our neighborhood and it said they're going to other neighborhoods from there that's right that's right uh-huh and then quite often they'll get shot because uh they're horning in on somebody else's territory that's right that's right uh i think they said forty one had been shot out of one church in the last year my gosh the only thing about the death penalty and and i know that that they try to be careful and they try to be sure but these people are on death row for like twenty years you know and you know if if right i know it you know i i think to be you know convicted being convicted is one thing you know and that's and that's great if they're convicted if they're sentenced to death to me you could not sentence them to death unless the case was for sure i mean it had well it goes all through the state it goes all through the state supreme court system before they're right right and and by the time it gets there and they've been convicted and then they've been sentenced to death uh-huh then it should happen yeah they're sure i mean there's no doubt i mean i there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty so once they've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt do it that's right you know just right i don't i guess i mean that's may sound that sounds cold but gosh you know we're keeping you know we're we're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row uh-huh that's right and not doing anything with them and it's costing us a heck of a lot of money and that's terrible to look at it that way but yeah it is i know but that that's the way it is yeah if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death then do it you know uh we had one in Virginia that was sentenced to death and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago i don't know if there was anything in your paper about it i didn't notice it huh-uh and there was a lot of protest even Robert Redford you know was protesting this guy's execution so the governor backed down and i was so mad the crime was horrible his crime was just horrible gosh yeah oh man yeah and those kind of people i'm sorry you don't reform them you know i really believe you don't no i don't think huh-uh if they're the kind of people that commit these excuse me grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again you don't reform those kind of people hum-um and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me no no and i don't know the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas you know well if you're insane enough that you can go right yeah cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard then are you can can you be helped you know i have i have my doubts you know that's right yeah yeah i do too i you know i don't know i think there's a point some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do it's just it just gets out of hand and i understand that you know that you know my husband and i right wasn't it Lewisburg that had a lot of uh bad things happening just in the last couple of weeks or was it not no no huh-uh no maybe it was i think it was the South East area from Dallas my daughter my daughter lives down in Rowlett and she was telling me about it yeah i can't remember what the town was some little area oh really yeah oh really yeah we've had several here lately and it there were several of them in North Dallas and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in South Dallas and that's maybe what you were talking about men breaking in uh to houses and taking or a man they they think it's the same person taking uh little girls right straight out of their beds at night an d you know breaking in obviously watching them in the house because they're breaking into the right window oh gosh and that's the last they saw yeah you know the little girls bedrooms and taking them out putting them in a car and driving them out and taking them out and molesting them and then bringing them back and throwing them back in their own front yards oh gee is that right i hadn't heard about that yes that is happened i think there's been i think there's been like six or seven of them over the last like probably eight eight or nine months gosh they don't kill them they just molest they don't kill them no they've taken and they're all like um like nine anywhere from nine to twelve years old i think is what they've been gosh gosh and he's taken them and and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard and boy that's scary isn't it oh can you imagine because it it happens in the middle of the night so the parent yeah you know these parents didn't know this the the kid was gone until the kid is knocking on the door screaming let me in you know can you imagine yeah oh boy yeah you wouldn't even dare put these signs in the window little emblems in the window saying child in this room in case of fire you know have you seen those shoot i you know i've got one of those in Brian's room i never even thought about that yeah yeah God maybe i'll take it out i hadn't even thought about it yeah it is that's terrible well it's really bad that you have to be you know we we were over at a neighbors tonight and and Brian my little boy is only is just a little over two and their little boy is like five you know so there's a big difference and they were playing in the back yard and we were getting ready to leave and i went out in the back yard to get Brian and the boys were gone and the back fence was open you know uh-huh oh gosh oh gosh yeah and she didn't act like it bothered her at all oh this happens all the time and we walked through the fence out the alleys or come to the back of the house you know and walked and i looked down both directions of the alley and i saw neither one of them and uh uh-huh yeah and oh and she was like oh God he does this all the time you know where are you you know screaming J D and you know my heart was in my throat you know and uh he Brian was two houses down oh oh boy and he's five shoot i guess so gee you know and he you know i don't know i know parents around here just let their kids run everywhere and i just can't do that yeah there was a little girl picked up in Rowlett from uh from her front yard and her dad was working in the back yard and had just left her few minutes in the front yard and somebody apparently drove up and took her and they never saw her again oh God oh man this is too scary that is just too scary you know i let Brian play here in the back yard and we've got yeah there's two gates that go into the back yard and we've got one of those big eight foot privacy fences and one of the gates has a padlock on it and then the other gate just has one of those slide bar things but it's on the inside it's right uh-huh uh-huh you know you'd have to climb like come over they'd have to come over the fence they could not open a gate you know and i still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there you know i mean if i don't hear him playing i mean i i get up and come out and look out the window real often you know so uh-huh right yeah watch yeah yeah i don't blame you it's really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids but i mean you do better safe than sorry um-hum and if they find who's doing that to those little girls as far as i'm concerned he could he could fry yes to put it very bluntly he could fry yes yes because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder fry yeah right you know i and i believe that and this is one of them because these little girls will never be the same yeah yeah huh-uh that's terrible never be the same so i don't know it's it's really scary and i don't know what to and i don't know what needs to be done you know it seems like there's no room in jails to put them in jail and when they do put them in there you know were i'm taking a business law class at night and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney and oh gosh so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases you know and he said you can pretty much you know if you ever get on a jury you know you're not told this but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess whatever you sentence them to they're going to serve about a quarter it's going to be reduced right uh-huh they they'll serve they'll serve a quarter of it so if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years don't sentence them to fifteen years sentence them to a hundred you know because then they'll serve fifteen or twenty so which is really i don't know yeah yeah yeah it's just not it just doesn't seem right no it doesn't it doesn't they just get out you know there was a thing on well what are we going to do about it How i mean how can it be changed well i don't know unless the legislature will do something and they don't seem to that's the thing and you know we're just going to have to adopt a a completely different attitude uh-huh and we're going to have to say if you commit this crime and if we're sure you commit this crime you are going to be sentenced to death period yeah period and do it you know and if you commit this crime you will be in prison for the rest of your life we're not going to say we're going to put you there for the rest of your life and let you out in fifteen years we're really going to do it you know it's just the system has just yeah right and and i understand they're doing it because the prisons are full but somewhere we've got to come up with some money to build to build more you know and keep these people in them you know right i think so yeah yeah i think it would be worth it everybody would they were i was watching a show about this the other night and you know they were like in i think it was on Forty Eight Hours or Morning  well what's uh what's the best experience you can come up with uh as far as camping oh gee the first one that comes to my mind is uh camping outside the river at the uh at New Braunfels there oh man that sounds like a blast yeah we've gone down there many a year is that right camping riding the river rapids yeah that that's where you just float down the river right yeah well they have some you know half way decent rapids there on tubes an i see it's not Deliverance but it's pretty good well that sounds pretty neat i guess i guess for me um um probably the last time i went camping was uh back in high school with Boy Scouts we always took an annual trip up to uh Colorado and went fly fishing oh really and uh we had we had a blast up there yeah i never tried that it it was nice going up there and see that scenery well i uh we've done quite a bit of camping we uh used to uh throw everything in we had some old Volkswagen buses in our years early days when we had kids and they uh we'd uh you know go uh drive up into the hill country around uh oh New Braunfels and i see San Marcus around in through there right Austin up around Austin area i see just camp out did they have some pretty good campsites up there yeah uh usually we'd go uh like the state parks a lot of the state parks up in through there i see there's quite a few of them up there uh We started off pretty rough you know pretty much roughing it and we had like i say the Volkswagen bus we'd pull up and just i had fixed up the thing where you could just open up the doors i'd hooked on a little extension and made a tarp for the side and and and uh then we were set up in about five minutes ten minutes that was a regular party machine huh out by the side of the river yeah then we uh later on we started using a tent when we'd go to uh you know tent camping i see that sounds pretty neat we enjoyed it uh we had three kids and uh they've done a lot of camping with us and right they just seemed to like it yeah i remember uh going with my parents uh we weren't very good campers it seemed like we were never prepared and uh we i grew up right around Amarillo up in the very northern part of Texas um-hum and uh we had a couple of lakes out there that we'd go and and go fishing and then camp out and uh seemed like it always rain or something you know something had to go wrong and uh we were never prepared for it ha so uh it wasn't it wasn't until Boy Scouts that i really started enjoying uh going out and camping pretty uh pretty rough up around Amarillo isn't it it sure is uh in fact we went up there for Easter and and we we had uh a beautiful day we had a day where it snowed and then uh it rained the next day and you know you just never can tell what the weather's going to do that's my uh one of my wife's favorite stories to tell about Easter camping trips it the coldest Easter ever we left here uh we left here it was shorts weather in uh on Easter and right we went up and were going to spend on the Blanco River and we got there and a front come through and it was it was freezing oh Lord we didn't of course weren't prepared for it so right oh and there's nothing worse when you're out camping if you get wet you know it we sat there my brother-in-law cooked chicken bless and he was don't know how in heck he managed to do it but he did he stood out there and cooked that and we had something hot to eat that's hilarious we got up the next morning and she said i don't know about you but she said i'm going into town and we're going to buy some long johns i'm surprised you didn't just pack up and go home i tell so i was ready i was ready to go back to Houston that's right that's right oh Lord i guess everybody's got those experiences when uh when things just didn't didn't go right for them yeah that's uh sometimes turns into fun i think another similar one was when we'd go uh up to Bastrop Strate State Park there in uh kind of got caught by the cold weather and we uh gathered what firewood we could and built us a campfire you know and sat around there right into the wee hours and uh ran out of firewood so we uh each took turns going out and gathering up big bundles of pine needles and throwing them on the fire and they didn't last very long but they burned hot oh Lord oh Lord i remember that that was a lot of fun that is funny but we uh most recently we still go camping every well not as much anymore we our kids are pretty near grown and uh really i uh we had uh we've used a tent you know pop up trailer right we've done some camping in that we still go down to the river at least try to get down there once a year i see Braunfels do they have uh actual camp sites there where you can go and yeah uh-huh i see they're some they're some they're some what you'd call primitive i mean there are no uh real facilities and then others that have uh facilities or yeah there's a few that have hot and cold uh you know electricity and and hot water and so forth there's a few of those and you have to make your reservations pretty well in advance oh you do have to make reservations there yeah because it's you know it is so nice and there limited space so uh-huh right we usually if we're going we usually try and make them by March or so anyway oh i see huh i didn't realize that so it's uh yeah it's uh pretty nice since it's so popular it's best to to have the reservations huh well if you want to get a good camp site yeah you can go down and get a camp site pretty near any weekend they get prett y crowded on the uh you know the main July Fourth of July and right right Memorial Day and whatever yeah and Labor Day yeah that water can get pretty cold though if you go too early oh is that right yeah when's the best time to go down there for the water we try not to go before uh July because uh it takes uh it takes that long to get it heat up gets warmed up yeah it comes out of the Canyon Lake up there and it's uh comes out of that deep lake and it's pretty cold water you know i see huh because my wife and i had thought about going down there uh you know just for a weekend um-hum because we have some friends from uh that went to school in San Marcus at South Texas yeah and uh they're always talking about how they rode the uh those inner tubes down the river and that sounded like a fun that'd be a fun weekend well in addition to to the river what we call it's the Guadalupe River it's uh has campsites all along the river uh but then there's also Camp Warnicke where you can get cabins you know it's right on the River hum downtown New Braunfels i see and then they have the uh what they call the shoot which is uh it's a bypass around the dam where they have uh the comes right through the downtown part of New Braunfels huh that's a lot of fun yeah so you can actually rent cabins there yeah um-hum at uh Camp Warnicke and that's in that's in New Braunfels property right in yeah right in uh almost right in downtown huh and uh that's a lot of fun then they have a uh there's a commercial water park they're called the Schlitterbahn which is a barrel of fun i see especially if you've got kids yeah yeah they have tube ride tube shoots and just and so many rides you can't almost can't do them all in a day you know God that sounds like a blast yeah it's uh it's a uh all day event well that sounds like that might be a fun fun place to visit then yeah we'll have to give that a shot well i tell you what i guess uh i need to head out but i i appreciate the the conversation yeah well i'm uh you have a good you have a good week hit one of my topics huh oh good deal good deal well you have a good one you too all right bye-bye bye  okay well what do you think do you well i'm kind of leaning towards i don't know i'm thinking about what from one to ten what my number would be it'd probably be somewhere closer to uh less control because i don't see i'm not a member of the NRA although my father is but uh-huh i i guess i believe i i think the NRA has gone overboard the wrong way you know they're sitting there on number ten saying they're saying absolutely no gun control we don't even want to think about it and yeah and i think that's a dumb situation because there has got to be some kind of background check to see that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose you know if if if you're going to hunt with it if you're going to do sport shooting you can wait a week yeah um-hum right that's true it's not a big deal for them to go if they can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket you know i mean they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record armed you know felony record you know right that's true any of that kind of stuff and it seems to me right now that there's not there's not that much of a check i i'm not really sure what Texas law i think there's a check for felonies for felonies on your record if the gun shop owner does it you know but right but um-hum yeah but he has to go out and do it that's true i think that yeah if you and if it's a private sale of course then there's nothing right and see that's my only problem with uh making you um you know get the check and everything is is i guess bad guys if you want to call them bad guys they are going to get a gun no matter what um-hum they're not i don't think they're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check i think they're going to go out and find it someway individual sale or something like that yes but but maybe well prevent a few John Hinkleys yeah i hope that's true you know i i that's that's the kind of people i like i say i don't think the guy who's going to rob a 7-Eleven is going to rob a 7-Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife baseball bat or you know whatever yeah right knives exactly he's going to do what he wants to do that's true i i just think it makes the honest people more honest and but you know yeah and and the people who want it it's not that big a deal like i said to wait right right and if you have to have it in a hurry something's wrong yeah yeah it makes you wonder what they need it for all of a sudden here hum that's right that's right well i'm married to a policeman so we we talk about this a lot yeah i imagine i imagine his his opinion is a little bit towards the one there on the scale of one to ten he needs some more gosh if i was a cop i'd be yeah yeah yeah i was watching a worried about that too many people have too many too much access yeah they do they do and i i guess i think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of gun i mean some of these Saturday night specials that these companies put out that are a piece of i mean they're they're basically it says here buy me and go rob a 7-Eleven that's right right or even even the um the little um toy guns look real i mean i've heard so much about that on TV and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one yes they that's really gotten bad or your child accidently if your child is old enough to i mean there're a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve or fourteen or yeah yeah right and and especially some of the minority children whether you know a racist or not that's the truth and and if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands and a cop comes up um-hum right i mean you can't blame them it looks like they've got a weapon you can't jeez jeez and you can't take the chances the that's right because there's been kids that age who have killed people and you know you know there was a law in exactly i think it's in Oregon where they've now made all toy guns they're they're making them like neon colors you know yeah and the kids don't care my kid doesn't care he picks up a stick and goes bang so it doesn't make any difference to him right and i think that's a good idea that's right i know right right a gun's a gun to them they can play with anything make it a gun that's exactly right yeah yeah so you ought to do i think they ought to do that with toy guns they ought to make them very reasonably do something outrageous to them you know so that they're not so that they're very distinguishable from a real gun right right exactly that's right that's a good idea well i was uh watching TV yesterday and there's a town in Georgia yes and it's the law that you have a gun every adult you know uh is able to carry a gun and and they encourage it yeah and the police love it which really surprised me and i and i think and that's what they were going after um that's kind of they encourage it hum they went to interview this town i mean it's a little dinky town they went to interview them about the gun control laws and uh the police said you all the people said that's fine we care less you know we're all honest and everything like that we we all carry them but we we don't mind being checked and uh and i think it kind of took that um hum neatness away from it you know like well heck everybody's got one you know and i don't know i so it was it was it was quite unusual to see the people in that town that's kind of an odd thing i don't know i have a gun and i mean my folks have always had i learned to shoot when i was real little i think that's a lot of it too is that people um-hum need to teach their kids what not to what to do and what not to do because i started shooting my dad right exactly started letting me shoot like a little air BB gun when i was probably five or six years old but um-hum yeah you know it was this is how you hold it this is the only place that you do it which was you know out far and away and you don't ever touch it unless i'm here and you don't point it at at people and then they had then i went to the Texas right that's what we're doing exactly Parks and Recreation i guess but anyway the safety hunter safety program that you have to do now i think it started in about nineteen seventy if you want if you want to go deer hunting and your birthday's after oh yeah oh nineteen something fifty five or something then you have to go attend one of these hunter safety courses or you can't get a deer license um-hum well that's neat well that's real neat and it and it's basic stuff it's like it's don't you know when you're climbi ng over a barbed wire fence don't point you don't lean your gun against it you know and you and then you crawl over it and have it shoot yourself and uh it yeah right well that's real good those things happen it it it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people right right and it's and they usually are real basic yeah put the safety on the gun don't assume always assume it's loaded that's that's got to be the most common thing that people yeah it's oh it's empty it's empty boom you know common sense things i know and people don't want to believe that yeah it was fair i took the clip out or whatever and yeah and i forgot about the one in the chamber oh in the chamber that's exactly right yeah well we we're trying to teach our daughter she knows real well about um about her daddy's guns what not to do and what to do around them oh yeah does he got them locked up all the time too when he's home yeah um and and and she and she's real um and she'll know she'll even tell her little friends don't ever you know touch my daddy's guns or something like that so she's real she's real good about it and she's never been curious don't even think about it yeah yeah hum i mean because he's always you know if he's has them out cleaning them you know she can be there and he'll tell her how he's doing it or you know show her the insides and stuff like that um-hum yeah if you make it where it's not something to be feared and curious yeah not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared of if it if it's just one more piece of something but but they've got to understand like you said never touch it but yeah right exactly right they have to have that respect for what it does and what it can do ours is a we have a shotgun and it's up in the closet um-hum and then the shells are in another part and it's sometimes i think about it and and i got it because my husband used to travel and be out of he was out of country one time for three months oh yeah and i was like uh you know we're in a nice neighborhood but still and you and then i've got it so far sometimes i think i i wonder if i still i'm not about to load it because i you know i assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there and it's in a case and it's you know it's put up and it's away and all that but i don't want to take the chance and i think if somebody ever does break in it's going to take me a year to find the shells and then get it don't come in the um-hum right he's got to go to a lot of trouble yeah hold on hold on it's in here somewhere i know it is yeah well i know i know how to use them we go we go hunting every once in a while and he showed me how to use his guns and i really enjoy it but hum boy if someone did break in i don't i don't know that i could or would even grab it i know i i used to think about that it was a lot easier when i was when i was when i was single it was one thing and when i was married just married with no kids when it was just me um-hum that's true it was an easy decision yeah yeah it was like you you come after me you're going to get it you know and now there's so many other things where are the kids what are they doing you know where is this person coming in from uh you've got and and if if you if you manage to get it out yeah right yes right and then you know what how how can you even afford to to think about what what you're going to do with it because you don't know where your kids are at the same time ugh true true well we have dogs that are pretty very protective so if they're if they're stupid yeah if they're stupid enough to come through then yeah we do too yeah i figure they'll make enough noise but yeah it's it's i kind of think we we have two big dogs in the backyard i always kind of thought that too kind of an extra buffer yeah yeah they've got to be pretty stupid and and most people uh uh that uh break in or whatever go to houses without the dogs luckily yeah anything that the well any any advantage they can take right and that's one of them so well unfortunately yeah guess it makes them worth the dog food over the years yeah yeah really does well do you think we've yeah i i think that's about all i can me too on gun control we're we're in pretty good agreement actually on it it would be an interesting it would be even more interesting you you to to meet some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum that's opposite yeah i think we are right right but i'm glad you're not so me too it's nice to find there's another reasonable person in Garland well it's been nice talking to you bye-bye right well good you too thanks bye-bye  we built our home in what was a brand new subdivision in nineteen sixty five and we were the fourth lot in this subdivision to be built on um-hum uh finally just last year the last home of the last lot was sold and the home a home was built on it so the subdivision is now full but we're in a community of five thousand people oh that's pretty nice i did mine i built my own home in nineteen sixty one oh that's pretty much about the same time and i i built on two acres of land in a town called Cumberland Rhode Island yes um-hum and it was it's uh it's just a private uh piece of property i mean there's no you know there's no other well there's other houses in the area but at that time there were just individual homes scattered throughout um-hum the town and i guess the town of Cumberland's probably got thirty five thousand people in it or so um-hum which is right on on the Massachusetts Rhode Island state line that's that's why i work in Massachusetts it's only it's only a twenty minute ride um-hum and uh i did the whole house myself as a matter of fact i had the foundation poured the concrete poured and the rest of all the building i did entirely on my own which was quite a project uh i don't um-hum would you do it again oh i see well we wouldn't have done it the first time so no no i i i don't think so uh i i would i would probably i would act as a contractor and subcontract everything out i think um-hum i but i would not physically do the work because i worked every night after after working all day in the in the plant and then weekends all your weekends were tied up and it took me about oh a little over seven months to finish it which i thought was pretty good did you finish it yes i i completely finished the house so you do not have any place that has a mop board off or a a piece uh we have a friend who uh rents rents homes redoes homes and rents them no uh-huh and he never quite has finished any one of the houses that he's done i mean there's always just one little detail that well i i had uh when i moved in i did not have my garage built and my breezeway and the concrete stairs upstairs the stairs the stairs were were made out of wood and the reason i did that it was getting late in November and the winter was coming um-hum and i just i ran out of time really and i i waited until the house was completely finished in the interior and the exterior exterior of the house short of the breezeway and the and the attached garage um-hum um-hum and i did that and the driveway the following spring which uh i needed a break from the work and i i needed a break to get a little more money ahead stuff like that so i waited sure oh probably November December until March or April i guess around April and then i went ahead and built the breezeway and the garage because i thought it was too cold to be pouring concrete outside in the winter time um-hum um-hum did do you find that uh the area has changed since you built your home or has or has the area mainly it are the rest of the homes in keeping with the decor or in the style of yours uh sure yeah they they that area has managed to maintain itself very well the people are um-hum real proud of their homes and they've managed to take care of them um-hum but i noticed now that several of the homes where the elderly folks that live there have either gone on or or moved or whatever um-hum and their children are now living there okay um-hum and they just don't team seem to tend as much to them as their parents did does that make sense um-hum well it's a little bit surprising because uh the older we get my husband retired a little over a year ago and um-hum we still of course are maintaining our home and he keeps up the painting and and all of this and we did remodel we have a large uh den i suppose it is kitchen den combination and we did remodel that after oh i yeah yeah i've done the i after uh he retired but as far as doing anything uh major to it we at this point would rather travel and i uh i've done the same i did the same thing but what i'm saying is that some of the people that i know they have moved on to Florida or retired you know similar to your you know your situation um-hum um-hum but their homes have passed on to their uh children or or to younger younger families and they don't seem to maintain it as well as the original people did i or or like you would or i would and perhaps its just it's right oh yeah um-hum you know some of them homes were given to them and some of them the young people had to buy and perhaps they don't have the money to spend on them yes somehow we don't think of a gift as being quite as dear to us as something that we've had to work for i mean yeah yeah i think you're right i think you're right uh we i i look at our home though and i think well gosh you know if we don't do this then the next person who owns this home for instance is going to probably remodel the kitchen put in new cabinets that kind of thing you know after oh twenty six years uh things get a little scuffed up and it's not something that i'm not interested in the mess anymore sure sure yeah uh the style of our neighborhood uh we're certainly not the smallest home and we're not the largest home but it has maintained itself in that the homes that were built afterwards uh have come up some of them are a little smaller because at one point they wanted to put some two thirty five housing in what is what is two thirty five housing i'm not familiar with that term here in Rhode Island well it it it's a law it was quite some time ago when the neighborhood was very new and we had some very very restrictive covenants uh in the subdivision and they were attempting to put seven houses in an area that was originally set aside for five oh okay and i think the two thirty five came because they could people could get into them for a down payment of something like two hundred and thirty five dollars i see and of course we were involved with an attorney and were able to stop that before it got off the ground and so the some of the homes on that side of the street are a little bit smaller but they were um-hum i built a i built a three bedroom Colonial home with one and a half baths up and down uh-huh and a and an attached two car garage and a breezeway and it was a it's a pretty substantial home i yeah uh-huh i i i like the roominess of it uh and and i actually the only thing i've done other than you know wallpaper and painting paint over the years in the in the interior is i did refinish all the kitchen cabinets and i put a kitchen in the basement uh-huh um um-hum which was probably the best move i ever did um-hum okay and uh we have a rock base here and it's very difficult excuse me Verna for just a second can you hang on just a second okay sure okay there's your report okay and that's everything would would you give this to Barbara Rashad for me please would you carry that over okay if you want to hang on a minute you got a minute okay hang on a minute and i'll i'll uh finish up with this lady yes ma'am we have a rock base here and it's very difficult to put in a basement our home is all brick and with the two yeah are you are you on a flat on a slab like no no we're build you do you have a basement no we do not have a basement because we would had to have built up instead of down because uh there's the rock is so close to the surface here that it's difficult to to do basements so we didn't do that but um i see okay we have an attached two car garage and etcetera typical family the family home well it sounds it sounds it sounds like you have it sounds like yeah sounds like you have a real nice home and it's uh it sounds like what part of Indiana or is is we're uh two miles we're between Indianapolis and Chicago on Interstate I sixty five and we're just now being found by the north end of the state and getting a lot of okay you know there were homes on the market for ten years that sold in the last year because there's a lot of people coming down from is your real estate market uh slowed down there like it is here in the northeast it just it just went crazy this last year everything sold absolutely everything i mean we had someone come knock on our door the other day and offer us a price which i thought was absolutely ridiculous for our home the problem is there's nothing else to buy it did is that right you know well if you sell it for that sure if you sell it for that price whatever you have to buy is going to be inflated by that same amount so there's really not an advantage to it that yeah well and our children are all here and we want to stay here so sure we have no reason to sell so nice talking with you sounds like you're busy well okay Verna yeah well i'm in my office and i have someone here with me and uh it's really been a pleasure i enjoyed it and uh if you ever get to New England look me up thank you bye-bye thank you ma'am  what kind of lawn and garden work do you do well right now the place where i'm living the yard was basically neglected for the about the last twenty five years so i've been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn and after three years of working at it i've i've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back instead instead of mowing it the same direction every time changing one day you'll or one one one time you'll cut it cut the lawn the long way then you'll go the opposite way instead of going lengthways you go width and it helps the grass come back oh does it really i didn't know that did um you've been working on it for three years for for three years really what have you done killing lots of fire ants i was firmly convinced the entire front yard was nothing but one gigantic ant mound uh-huh because it was like you couldn't you couldn't even stand still out there without ants starting you know i can barely hear you is this better yeah a little bit yeah it was like you'd go out in the yard to water something you'd just be standing still uh-huh and the ants would start crawling up your legs and it's like i'm not standing in a mound though oh wow how did you get rid of them uh Dursban Two pardon a chemical called Dursban Two it's a crystal oh Dursban Two yeah Dursban will get rid of just about anything i think but um so you haven't had a problem with that since um not bad every once in a while you'll have a mound pop up but that's yeah gonna to be expected what else did it kill did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to um as far as i can tell it hasn't killed anything it wasn't supposed to the even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds it didn't kill it not really yeah really well that's pretty wild we yeah we used it for fleas we had fleas in our yard real bad last year and we did that um i just i'm not basically i like to mow the lawn believe it or not but i sometimes have problems starting the mower so a lot of times i don't get out and do it but my husband basically does most of it and he does the you know edging and all that kind of thing and we're renting and so we don't really put a lot of money into the uh you know this like this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt and some Saint Augustine we just we have winter rye out back and we have i don't even know what it is out front but um we this is the first house we've ever lived in and we're just not real into the lawn probably because we rent i guess huh but anyway well well you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard right uh-huh we get uh i found one thing that it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out in the lawn but every time i've done it it's got it it drives the fleas completely out of the area what powdered sulphur oh really hm i wonder why it does you don't you don't have to put a whole lot out just if you've got a broadcast spreader uh-huh i think it comes in a forty pound bag and it's real fine like flour uh-huh and you just sift yeah go out and do the entire yard and you i mean you don't have to put clumps of it just very lightly cover the entire yard really well i'll have to remember that because uh hopefully we won't have them this year but we have a cat that comes in and out and the cat was getting um fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house so we had a real problem last year with fleas and it was uh quite a drag because um we got them in our house and we're Christians and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas and we got rid of them believe it or not with smoke bombs which is just about impossible to do but we did and so we don't want them back this year you know so i'll remember that if we see it's a problem in the yard we almost they were so bad last year even ticks it i don't know we've had ticks before a lot and we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that i think we used Dursban we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing you know and spread it all out everywhere but that's about the extent of our lawn care so i don't know do you enjoy doing it oh i love it my wife can't understand it'd be a hundred degrees outside i'll be out there but it's too hot to be working in the yard i'm under the trees i'm having fun and i'm stopping to drink water so what's the problem yeah well that's well that's funny yeah not everybody enjoys it though everybody has a different things i kind of enjoy it and my husband doesn't i kind of have to sometimes i'm too busy to get out there and do it and he you know he doesn't really enjoy doing it but he'll do it and he doesn't gripe about it or anything but you know i'm kind of like you and he's kind of like your wife and you know in that he doesn't really enjoy it but i would like to have a garden though that's my thing but right now where we're living we have the trees where the uh roots are at the top of the ground everywhere all over the ground i don't know what kind of trees they are but you can't have a garden you can't till it or it'll it'll tear up a nice tiller so we're going to wait until we move we don't have a lot of sun either because it big trees back there so we're going to wait and when we move that's one of our priorities is to get a house where we can have a um garden and so i'd like to do that i have a feeling i'll be out there all the time taking care of that but that's our next thing do you have a garden i've got the this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at i'm sitting on about a two acre lot now and uh half of it's the back half is my garden um-hum oh are you kidding that sounds fun where do y'all live uh in Missouri City southwest southwest side of Houston oh really what southwest where southwest Houston oh really oh because we're in Dallas i guess i assumed you were here well that's neat and um yeah that's what we want we have a yeah that's really what we want but we just haven't been able to do that yet so one day we'll be able to do it and i'm excited about it and then i don't know anything about it and i'll have to learn and maybe i'll give you a on gardening what do you do in your garden and i'll go nothing what is should i do but anyway i guess that's about it though it sounds like we've covered all the bases so i guess we'll let you go and um do you have anything else you wanted to say uh no enjoyable very enjoyable conversation with you okay i know you too i hope you have a nice day and we'll talk to you later bye okay you too okay bye-bye  okay what kind of TV shows do you like well uh i don't have a lot of time to watch TV unfortunately this is not a good subject um i uh-huh when the little bit of time i do get to spend because i'm in school in the evenings um uh i like to watch movies and comedies and uh i watch the news i see uh-huh the news and the only game type shows that i ever watch are Wheel Of Fortune okay how about you um i don't i don't care for Wheel Of Fortune very much i don't care for game shows in general i guess uh they're not usually there's usually not that many on in the evening anyway so about the Wheel Of Fortune is about the only one that's on in the evening times well yeah i know oh i haven't watched it in ages but uh you know yeah yeah um i do like uh uh well they had a good TV movie on last night called Separate But Equal oh yes i didn't get a chance to see that it's a General Motors hall of fame type presentation uh it's a two-parter the other part's on tonight but it was about the uh the uh the well it's supposed to be a true story you know a dramatization the true story of the legal struggle that uh uh-huh ended up in the Supreme Court decision Brown versus the Board of Education which ended up um oh saying that separate and equal is not constitutional as far as you know schools it was talking about and it was interesting it was a uh-huh it's it's it's really a high one of these high drama type you know uh shows that's also true any of those things i like Hall Mark Hall Of Fame and those kind of shows are always so good i like i like to watch those oh yes yes they are they i love those but they unfortunately they don't have nearly enough of those those and the National Geographic ones specials those those are great too right right oh yeah i can watch those National Geographic ones over and over again yeah i know what you mean and they're they're good they're they're i like news shows too like uh Sixty Minutes or Twenty Twenty uh-huh uh when i have a chance i watch those on uh i guess Sixty Minutes is usually on Sundays and uh i just like to see you know who they are raking over the coals yes well you know it interesting they have a new one out have you ever watched Expose Expose i haven't caught that one yet uh that's kind of one along the line of Sixty Sixty i mean that excuse me Twenty Twenty and uh yeah Sixty Minutes but uh Twenty Twenty uh i've only watched it once uh like i said i've been in class and uh so during the week uh i don't have much time and i spend a lot of time with uh my daughter on the weekend and she lives uh-huh a way away so uh i'm you we're not usually watching TV but uh but it is interesting uh they this time of year unfortunately it gets right right right kind of most of them are reruns and you know stuff like that that's why i kind of stick to the movies if they're good uh that one sounds good though that was on last night i didn't get a chance to i didn't get home till ten so yeah right uh-huh yeah yeah it's like right well that makes it hard yeah that was a good show um what else do i enjoy oh my wife and i have been into this uh uh LA Law have you ever heard of that show yeah uh-huh i've heard of it i haven't watched it uh uh-huh it's getting pretty you know it's kind of like a Dallas type thing you know but it's more of it it takes place in LA and it's this law office and all the cases they take and the and the uh interoffice uh uh politics and so forth people trying to maneuver and get power and back stabbing and also helping each other and you know if you know all the love interoffice love affairs and uh all that all that kind of stuff and you know power struggles to see who's going to be the next uh uh oh uh-huh president of the law firm or whatever and that kind of thing and uh and then of course they always have a lot of court cases and they show where they actually have courtroom drama yeah uh-huh type thing where they're trying to you know you're always sitting there trying to guess at the end of the show you know and they always have the verdicts you know and you're always trying to out guess is he going to be guilty or innocent or whatever and they always put you know twists and turns twists i was just going to say yeah usually twist it you know it's hard oh yeah they throw a lot of twists and turns in like like one of the recent shows there was this really uh a young woman who uh was accused of killing her millionaire husband who was you know much older than she was like you know in her early twenties and he was in his sixties and he was she was accused of killing him for his money and she said no she wasn't and the and this law firm took on the case and got her off uh-huh um and uh and you know you think she's innocent all along you know and just you know because because of her circumstances that you know that's why people thought she had done it you know because it just looked so obvious that she had done it and that's why everybody assumed she had right and so they get her off and at the very end of the case after it's over he's talking with her and he figures out that she really did do it after all a uh after after he got after he got her off oh my gracious so what did he do then ooh yeah well then they couldn't retry her oh well that's how the show that's how the show ended it just left you hanging there like you know like you set me up you fed me all this information information you know that made it look like this other person was guilty you know and oh uh-huh and that's how he basically got her off by by casting a shadow of doubt saying well this other his daughter did it you know and because this other will was had her name on it you know and all this kind of stuff but actually she had done it after all and he figured it out after he made her innocent and then that was right before he was going out to the big news conference you know to oh my good to talk to the reporters and stuff you know and how does it feel be you know to get her off the hook and this and that and they he went out there knowing that she was really guilty so that kind of thing so it's a fun show then i like comedies also like uh yeah oh there's a show call i watch Roseanne once in a while uh you you've heard of her probably yeah yeah oh yes i don't watch her anymore not after that Star Spangled Banned thing yeah yeah i don't watch her that often i watch sometimes i watch The Simpsons that's that cartoon show uh-huh i've never watched that either Bart Simpson's or a Coach is another one it's a sports comedy where the guy is a coach of a a football team a team Minnesota State where they're never have a good team you know but he's always trying to i have watched that yeah that's good always try ing to pull it off and he has his a girlfriend a a broadcasts anchor at the local news station and she's always trying to get him out of jams and she so you know whatever whenever i have time i just turn it on basically and see what's on yeah it's a nice way to relax i mean in a way i mean i find it anyway although sometimes watching the news isn't very relaxing i get home from from it is no no class and everything and turn on the TV and watch the news early news and it's like uh i i didn't really need to watch that before i go to bed you know right yeah so but i enjoy taking in a movie when i can i'm going to try to watch the second half of this one tonight yeah well see that was that's another if i would have been home probably wouldn't have watched it because i have class tonight and i would have missed the second half and that's the most frustrating because that's you know you can if you missed the first half yeah yeah yeah yeah you can kind of catch up they catch you up you know with the second one but if you miss the second half you've missed the whole you know outcome and oh it's frustrating they catch you up and the right do you have like a a VCR where you could tape it or something on the record mode or on the time yeah no i don't unfortunately we have cable but that's one thing i need to we had one but it broke down so uh i haven't gotten another one because i haven't you know i haven't even hm it broke down yeah yeah right rented movies to watch because yeah yeah but uh but perhaps perhaps when it's over i will you you know i of course so little so little time to do that yeah have a chance more chance to relax right well that's it i but i have gotten we have cable and so um that's right there's always a movie on yeah sometimes i spend a lot of time on that some movies that i would never have gone and seen uh you know have turned out to be really good movies uh you know you hate to spend the money on them especially as expensive as movie theaters are today you right right how much are they out there uh movies oh uh it costs you six fifty to go to a movie each a piece to go to uh a movie unless you catch a good matinee yeah six fifty yeah hm out here i it's i think out here they are still about five fifty about a dollar less uh-huh well uh everything's high priced out here but uh uh things are going up all over too yeah yeah yeah uh but i'd rather you know watch it on of course the only problem with cable though is it's it's is that they show the same one over about five hundred times before you know you don't get that many new ones in but uh uh right they have a lot of good uh my son likes to watch uh the sports station you know and uh specials uh-huh yeah the all sports station yeah right uh you know things like that so uh that's what makes it worth it uh because he's handicapped and he's at home all the time so so uh uh-huh right i see uh you know he enjoys that but uh um i i like i said TV isn't my best subject because but i i do enjoy a good comedy a good movie is a comedy if i can you know sit down and and watch or if they have a good uh right you know show on that's a good comedy i'm not real much for the sitcoms because of their they need to have a new twist or something in some of those you know they're getting all kind of the same but um uh uh-huh the same yeah yeah it's just well i think we've probably talked long enough about this subject uh yes uh okay well it was nice talking to you and uh well it was nice talking to you and you have a nice day okay you too bye-bye now okay bye  today as i understand it is less than half of all eligible voters participate in national elections um-hum and less than that in local elections and do you think that's a problem and do you have any or do we can we can come come up with any solutions for that so if you're ready we'll start um-hum okay i participate in all of the national you know elections and the state elections that you know that affect me i'm sometimes not too good in local elections i do i do vote you know in bond matters and uh things like that but i don't i no longer have children in school so school board elections you know doesn't really um-hum you know i don't really get terribly interested in that um-hum but i do try to i don't just vote for to be voting you know i try to have you know educate myself a little bit you know on the on the issues rather than just voting blindly you know right um-hum but that's what i do i always i vote in the national elections and i vote pretty much i i've been pretty good about voting in um most of um for like the for for mayor and for governor and and things like that and try to try to um-hum right um-hum you know go through and figure out because most of the people you don't a lot of them you don't have any knowledge of and just go in and just arbitrarily voting all Republican or all Democrat i try to i try to find out a little bit about them that's true um-hum yeah yeah i do too but i understand why i i know one problem is uh why people don't don't register to vote i i know some personally because in the past and i think that's been changed that that's how they get the jury uh rolls from from voter registration but i think that's going to be changed yeah right uh-huh um-hum um-hum so i don't know if with that changing if uh you know if the voting will pick up but i think it's just like you say when you're if you're if you don't have an interest in something and you don't really care you may not go and vote uh-huh yeah that's true but uh that's true but uh what what is it what was the percentage for national elections less than half less than half less than half i was kind of surprised to hear that that that surprises me too yeah i thought it would have been higher than that hm do you ever or have you ever do you ever actively work for a candidate um no i haven't well i've only done it one time way back when uh John Connally was running for Governor State of Texas many years ago uh-hum um-hum my wife and i were pretty heavily involved in working in his campaign it's really interesting to do it's hard work but it it's interesting to do but i haven't done any of it done any of it lately so uh the campaign that you worked when he was running for governor and that and he was elected that time uh-huh right uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah it's i i would imagine it would be pretty i have uh a friend of mine whose her son-in-law is a judge and i've gone to a a few things with her um-hum uh-huh and uh it's it's just like a different different world getting involved with those kinds with those with those people in politics so it is interesting very interesting it really is yeah yeah it yeah it's interesting to do yeah we did mailings put up signs you know and things like that um-hum went to a few dinners things like it was interesting it really was of course it was all volunteer we weren't paid members it was interesting to do so what so do you think there's any what what could be done to improve the percent of voters i don't know maybe it's you know better education i don't know i do believe that you know if you don't educate yourself vote in this these elections whether it's you know local or national you pretty well you know deserve whatever you get you know if you don't if you don't participate in it right i really don't know what the solution would be everybody or a lot of people thought when they ended the poll tax you know many years ago that that would bring out you know a lot of voters um-hum i don't know maybe it maybe it should be stressed through you know public education in schools you know or something i don't know i don't know well i know for for you know my son who is of voting age and um-hum um he didn't want to he did he said he couldn't afford to be off from work because they did not pay pay them for being off from work and that's why he didn't register but um-hum um-hum i i wonder if that was really you know the real reason and then i know my daughter uh well she's twenty now but i got her a Voter Registration and gave it to her um-hum and i really don't think she ever turned it in but you know um-hum i just don't think it's important to to some people and maybe thing you know circumstances may change and um-hum but to get them interested in doing it i don't know yeah i don't know really know what a solution would be i really don't you know like you say if you if you do everything but fill out the card for them that's really about all you can do uh-huh maybe maybe a real campaign and you know just go vote instead of uh um-hum yeah that maybe it you know just just to really really encourage people to to do it so maybe that's maybe that would help i'm sure um-hum um-hum yeah some sort of educational process i'm not quite sure what unless a lot of the people who who who are eligible to vote have no transportation and and and that's true yeah you know not able to get there or or for whatever reason so uh i don't know uh-huh um-hum yeah i don't know either it's kind of a tough question um-hum don't really know what a what a real solution would be for it except like you say some sort sort of an educational process yeah um-hum something to generate interest i don't know quite what yeah i really don't know well maybe some other genius can figure this out i don't know well maybe maybe we'll get this question again and can get some thoughts in the meantime if i had some you know think about it ahead of time maybe so yeah right yeah well it's nice talking to you nice talking to you Charles bye take care bye-bye  so what is your latest experience with painting well i don't i haven't done any painting since i was a child and my father would be painting and i'd ask him if i could you know take a turn or something but uh when we bought our home it was recently uh-huh updated they did that maybe improvements so they could sell it and things so we didn't have to do any painting right and the condominium we moved in before my husband went over and painted but i the experience that i've had is that um whatever time he gave said oh it would take me about just about four hours because it was only about like eleven or twelve hundred square feet over there and he said oh it's going to be just about four hours well he was gone the whole day and he said well all i got done was the taping around isn't that amazing it it looks so easy just slapping paint on i had an addition put on uh-huh and um we and i decided because my inner room looked so dingy because i put these beautiful French doors in uh-huh and so i decided okay i'll just you know have them paint this little room you know a little ten by ten dining area it took four days uh-huh and even the painter couldn't give me a good estimate he said well i'll be done this afternoon you know uh-huh and pretty soon before you know it you know he's run into so many problems and it's just there's nothing there to be a problem i thought but um it just took him so much longer and uh-huh and he was there to paint the French doors also um and if you've ever painted French doors which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do because it looked so formidable um then then just yeah we we got this painter and i just called him because i got a little ad out of the you know the adcose or whatever in the mail and uh you know just got this painter person over here and he said yeah i can finish it in a day oh right so the whole project basically took a week oh i know it's just awful funny and i go what makes you a professional you know how much you know more do you know than i know about this whole situation but he just kept painting on those French doors you know and each little um paint stroke you know the paint wasn't going on right is what it was pane uh-huh so he had to redo them like three times before i was happy with them before he was happy you know that they even looked halfway decent and um so it's just been painting yeah i mean hire a professional but that doesn't guarantee anything no and it really like you said always takes way longer than anyone um is able to guess because i know my husband he he painted when he it was just the preparation time was so long that when he actually got down to the painting part right he it was like ten times longer than he already thought he would be done and and uh he did part of the in the at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in and um and he didn't notice until the next morning that the shades of paint between the two paint cans he had finished one can off and started another one oh no and then when we went in there you know one was blue they were white but one had more blue to it oh and that can make a difference too i mean uh-huh and they bring the uh you know little samples and you've got like maybe five hundred well that's an exaggeration uh-huh but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints and you don't know what you to want to put up there and by the time it's on i i selected a what i thought was white and it was like you said you know it was blue blue cast to it and it looked awful on uh-huh uh-huh so that was the next problem he had to redo that too i yeah this was a and it was a major project getting the money together to do it too by the end of the whole project but right you know we worked something out because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long he really came over here to paint i think because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house i don't think he did the interiors very well oh boy and yeah well i don't recall my parents having that much trouble with their's i mean you know they painted our rooms all the time and we had a a wooden we hardly we just had brick on like as accent no uh-huh on a certain area of our home growing up and so he had to paint the outside all the time and um i just don't think you know that there was that big problem it wasn't a big deal for them i don't know no but to us you know we're going oh we're so glad we have a brick home all we have is like trim around the windows or something and i think my husband's really glad about that no uh no painting to have to do i i don't know that we for sure like uh say we're freshly graduated from school and things so we haven't gotten to the point where we're hiring professionals to do too much of our needs do you you just you just get in there and do it yourself we've been trying to you know we've done that the whole time we were in school like trying to repair our own cars and things and yeah uh-huh yeah so i i want to get to the point where i could feel like i could just hire someone well it's it's not that easy it's like it's uh i don't even know if i you know i would not even recommend this person again to anybody i don't know uh-huh a i guess you get i i don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say well i'll accept something or you just really have to get on their back i mean about things and and working with what they say are professional painters i mean uh-huh i tell you what the fumes that the the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do anyway that's true i mean the fumes are amazing and i i don't think i could stay sane you know and no working with all that so i mean i know it's not lead based any more paints but my goodness but still it's harmful and they have to live with that every day i well yeah i think so in in their clothes and everything oh it does the only painting job that was really painless for us was in this condominium that the um association that manages it they have to take care of like the structural damage there was a roof leak and that was not something that we had to pay for so they sent their painters in to to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then you know repaint the whole ceiling in a certain room but they came in and um oh yeah they came in and did it and left in just no time at all and i think it's because they you know they were accustomed to working in that environment in those particular condominiums and i don't i didn't watch them but i couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it the whole ceiling you know just within a couple of hours ri ght and uh well maybe there are some professionals out there it makes you wonder uh-huh really it does uh for all that well um i hope you have a nice day today um well you too i guess it's getting getting to be lunch time i need to go take care of the kids but you have a good day and you take care okay okay bye Kay bye  okay Maureen uh could you tell me what type of uh dining out that you like to do well we're probably different from you folks down here we're into uh Mexican or Tex-Mex or something like that that tends to be one of my favorites is to go out to uh have some Mexican food we have like um El Chico's and one new place uh that's pretty good is uh Pappasito's so when i go out and i like to splurge on eating i usually like to go out and get some Mexican food and make sure there's a basket of chips keeps being replenished on the table is that that's because you're you're natives there and that's what you're used to you you've grown up that way no i'm not a native here actually um from Philadelphia originally and lived in uh Ohio for you know a good portion of time going to high school and college there so i've been down here for about eight years but uh i don't know that's just something that i really picked up on i really did like the Mexican food the other thing i like i guess um i don't eat it as often is maybe Italian food we don't have as many places around here to eat Italian food but um yeah right i like Italian food yeah we've got a place down at Providence that's that's called Federal Hill and it's all the old old Italians and they've got some real nice restaurants down there but what uh-huh we usually like to do is is go out and and have something that we normally don't have at home uh-huh like you can have uh naturally we've got a lot of fish up here you know and shellfish and because we live right on the coast yeah but that's readily available and we can usually have that at home or we usually throw a steak on our on the grill or something um but when we go out to to eat we like to go to a better restaurant i like i like jacket and tie um you know when you go out to dine it's we kind of make a night of it uh-huh uh-huh but we try to order something that we don't usually have around the house uh-huh and as far as um Mexican type we've got the only thing up here that we have anywhere close to that is Taco Bell that's not too close to the real thing yeah that's what i say because i i just last month i spent a week in Dallas oh yeah yeah that i hate you know and laser seminar that they had i don't know if you've seen the book uh-huh and then some of the local guys down there they they took me out to all of these places you know and it's it's really uh it's unique and i think i don't know if it's psychological or not but i think the beef down there is out out of this world we we just don't get the quality up here like like you have where did you go for it did you go like to Hoffbrau Steaks no we went to uh uh uh i we stayed at the Park Park Plaza Park Suites Park Suite yeah right across the street yeah yeah so we ate there one night and then we went to uh Picci's one night and had Italian you know where that is um over in um can't really tell you what part of the what part of the town it was in but it was it's supposedly known it was up by one of the colleges anyhow uh-huh um and that was in the middle of the week and it was it was you had to wait in line to get in um like i said it was noted for you know it's food and what was the name of it Picci's um okay and then uh oh no let's see i went someplace i can't remember the name of it some other place we went um but we went to one and they serve you i mean the hamburger was a pound of meat and the hamburger i know it was it was a huge loaf of bread i couldn't believe it i thought if this is the size of a hamburger down here I'll order hamburger and then we went to some fast food places that you know during during lunch we went out to some of those and it was good it was um right like Mexican food i like the burritos and all that but i don't like the spice the hot i i like it spicy but i don't like it i don't like it hot you know where you your yeah roof of your head's blown off last night we went out and people we were with she uh had fajitas and she had this pepper on the plate and maybe she thought it was a sweet pepper but it wasn't and she ate it and i was wondering why her eyes were watering she and she had drank all her iced tea and she right and and it doesn't make any difference either if you if you eat some of that stuff and you can drink a gallon and it doesn't seem to put out the fire but and some people like that me it it seems like i don't know how about you do you like the extremely hot yeah no no i i can maybe eat some jalapenos but i really don't you know ask for those on there i'm more like into the enchiladas and and stuff like that but no i don't really like it hot um i remember meeting somebody a long time ago before i ever moved to Texas and he put hot sauce on everything he ate i mean Tabasco's and that kind of stuff on everything he ate i think he must've just had a a stomach that was iron or something uh yeah yeah that's incredible that and um i'm afraid to take the chance when i go down there to eat a meal like that uh-huh because once you get it what are you going to do with it if it if it's too hot and i'm not sure if you know if when they cook down there if they automatically just do that they throw a couple of red peppers in it and you know in the the sauce because that's what they're used to yeah and up here we're not really well some people are i guess up here i mean they'll eat fire but i'm just not i'm not i don't mind the spices i love garlic and all the rest of that but uh-huh the hot stuff oh and that's all you mainly do t hen right Italians how about uh Chinese well those are my two favorites yeah you go out for Chinese at all you know uh yeah yeah there's one favorite place that we have called August Moon that's that's pretty good and uh i've got one thing on the menu that i really love but um we don't do that probably as often we used to do a a quick take out kind of place that wasn't real great Chinese but we used to do we just liked vegetable fried rice quite a bit oh yeah yeah just you know as a quick kind of dinner thing that's you know it's not real filling but you know get some veggies and rice and stuff every once in a while we go out to a little bit nicer Chinese place yeah that's what we'll do we'll take some we'll take take out like sometimes on the weekend um like snacks yeah you know like uh beef teriyaki or or chicken fingers or that type of thing uh egg rolls uh-huh or fried rice because it's easier to get out than to make it uh we'll do that occasionally um do you go out as much now as uh because the economy being such has that put a damper on you or does it make any difference well recently we've both been trying to do some diet so we haven't gone out because when they tell you about how much fat is in all that food you know it really kind of crimps your style there but um we probably you know maybe go out like once a week on the weekend usually with friends or something we kind of go out um not always you know sometimes we cook the meal at home and have people in oh yeah but i haven't really thought about you know the economy all that much and and eating out we we never really did it a lot but you know we do maybe go out a couple of times a month at least to eat out yeah you know up here it's it's the restaurant business has fallen off um uh pretty substantially because the the unemployment rate is pretty high uh-huh it's uh in Massachusetts it's almost ten percent now uh so people don't have the discretionary incomes that they had you know overtime has been cut back a lot in certain areas yeah but us i mean we still we live more or less like you and our kids are grown up and they're gone so it's just the two of us and uh we tend to go out maybe once a week maybe once every other week something like that but we'll we'll go out for uh uh-huh uh take out uh-huh and bring it home um but it hasn't it hasn't it uh it hasn't stopped us yet uh-huh and i was just wondering down there it hasn't done anything to you either so your economy is a little bit better though i think down there now well though you know TI has laid off quite a few in this area and then General Dynamics has its woes too so that it seems like there's been well oh okay so there's a lot of people recently you know when big companies uh change their programs and and such that there's been an influx of some unemployed but probably when you spread it out over everybody in Dallas it maybe has not changed the percentage all that much you know maybe one or two percent possibly it's hard to say yeah yeah it just seems like a lot when you hear about companies that keep continually advertising or stating that they're you know you know cutting out so many thousands of employees it sounds like big numbers of people out there right yeah that's true and it depends on life styles too down there i'm not sure if you all tend to go out more down there than we do up here or or if we tend to go out more i think the people down here must shop for entertainment because we have more shopping malls within close proximity i mean it's like we could have shopping malls even across the road from each other there must be a lot of people with a lot of money who just like to go out and shop because we have plentitude of shopping malls within like a five mile radius i  i think my daughter talked to somebody in Carolina what is that is it a school up there that uh yeah North Carolina State oh great great that's wonderful yeah yeah yeah i i didn't know that we were going to be talking to mostly TI folks i thought it was all scattered out among graduate schools or something yeah is that right yeah we uh we thought the opposite we thought well it's going to be TI people and i think they went to customers you know people that use TI computers and everything which is fine yeah yeah one of one of our professors went down to a seminar you guys had uh sometime last year and got the information and brought it back and uh-huh actually they don't talk about much uh of what it's for but my wife keeps keeps ask asking me and i'm saying well your computer is eventually going to just answer your voice you know they're they're of course it's very obvious for people with handicaps but in general i guess it would be faster that's right sure yeah you you yeah you could just sit there and talk than typing and everything so oh yeah it's it's uh around the corner reminds me of something i read in an Isaac Asimov science fiction thing one time uh-huh right well i mean it's so uh TI's uh been the pioneer on a little advertising for TI not that i know that much about the uh voice synthesis but they've been working on it for years and years you know they have the Speak and Spell and all of that of course but they're yeah yeah they're going to take it much further and i guess in aircraft and all that a lot of it is going to be like you talk to the computer like two thousand one or two thousand ten ten when you talk to the computer and yeah yeah yeah like Hal yeah Hal right that was great well what do you think about the metric system you well what do you do out there are you a professor you say no i'm a i'm a student here um yeah i think we should adopt it i i think we're a little bit backward as far as the rest of the world's concerned okay um i know it causes a problem for industry in a little in a small way but nothing that won't be overcome in a little bit of time yeah well we're not going to have much to fight over because i do too uh being an engineer most General Motors have pretty much and i'm not too sure about the rest of the cars i'm sure all the Japanese cars oh yeah i'm somewhat of a car buff almost all of it is metric uh-huh what what what bothers the heck out of me is uh one of these so-called American made cars where part of it's put together in Japan and what you've got is you've got standard and metric uh-huh you know you go in there with a wrench and you know oh golly it's not a metric it's a standard right right well i i work on GM cars only and i haven't noticed that that much usually the metrics will fit they're so close there's an overlap uh-huh uh you know there's something funny that i haven't really resolved with metric i've got to really go to the store and see if it's true i can't remember the size i think it's uh eighteen or something like that i have a set of metric and and the old wrenches too and i think that's an exact size of the three-quarters and they don't make it in metric they just skip over it and it yeah you're right you're right because mine goes from seventeen to nineteen yeah right and i was thinking i've got to get an eighteen because i don't i don't like i'm so used to when i'm grabbing tools for my car to grab for the number you know uh-huh because i don't even bother with the unless i'm working on a bumper or something but the engine parts and all are all metric you know yeah a friend of mine's got a a Colt and i was doing something to it and golly half of it was standard and half of it was metric it was the most irritating thing i haven't noticed it mostly being yeah well i mean well on General Motors cars it was all metric i use my metrics essentially when i work on the cars i don't well i guess uh in changing the oil i guess that's uh i don't even know a nine sixteenths or something like that i don't even remember yeah i don't either i can't convert them i'm hope uh but i was thinking i just had a cheap set of metrics in fact uh i thought well i guess either i lost the eighteen and then i i started to see it in stores and i noticed that the cheaper sets again i'm calling it cheaper sets minus the eighteen i thought well i've got to go to an expensive place go to Sears and get Craftsman tools there and see if i can't get that eighteen i want a full set you know yeah i still haven't checked out to see if they do make the eighteen i i'm sure they do they don't uh you think so i've i've i've never seen one i've never seen one i've never seen one well i guess they do i don't know why they wouldn't oh you haven't really i just thought it was my set so i just didn't have a a good quality set you know no as a matter of fact i don't think is there a sixteen i don't think there's a sixteen either uh i think it's what number did i just say eighteen something that is the same as a three-quarter and it that i i'd rather have it all metric yeah i would too i mean we we're just about the last holdout in the world to to hold on to this old archaic system i mean even England's gone metric right Texas uh Texas Instruments makes equipment for the semiconductor business you know we make not a lot of but we make we were making a lot of our own manufacturing equipment and i bet they have a lot of metrics there i think that uh the only emotional part might be in miles you know mile signs but that that's could be last anyway maybe pick a year two thousand say okay we'll slowly change but i think yeah yeah and and even changing the things i mean first off i i mean you need to address do you even need to change the signs because for so long people are going are going to be able to equate miles to kilometers i mean when you drive around Europe you do the same thing right right well i think the speedometers don't the cars have them both now am i not mistaken i i i look at mine i don't even know i read it yeah most of them do they have the uh yeah they have the the kilometer inside and the and of course the miles per hour great big so you can see it um upper and lower yeah right yeah i i i it's silly i don't i don't think that we ought to be any different it causes a lot of problems a lot of times between uh different countries in their manufacturing stuff and oh no i don't think so either i don't even know how many businesses are actually doing it without an order i'm not too sure that the government needs to order it although i guess they would have to in again mileage signs but uh it well you know even even uh interstate signs and stuff you you can reprint the number of kilometers on on that reflective uh stick on tape stuff that they use to uh yeah yeah right uh stick on those things and they can just all that's all they have to do i mean that wouldn't cost a great deal of money and uh uh-huh i i i just don't see any problems with it i think it's just uh obstinate Americanism oh yeah i think that i i guess it was uh five years ago or more than when they it failed and i guess people just got tired of talking about it i'm not too sure i guess there was no one really pushing it and no one saying that it was going to mean business to us i think nowadays uh-huh we all would say who are in industry and everything we'd say hey this means business we ought to that's right uh make everything metric and i just and i see no problem with it at all that's right exactly right i mean uh i i i can think of one for instance you take a you take a textile industry and they're selling stuff by the by the yard you know now now there's a big difference between a yard and a meter when you're talking about fabric uh-huh right yeah right and i don't well i i i'm ready to convert i i we probably all thought it was strange you know again five years ago but i don't think there's that many people with reservations anymore i don't know if uh no i mean look at all the all the food containers are labeled uh with both systems i mean that's no problem sure right in fact they said it failed and then i guess it has failed but i in in general there was still a lot of people that i i i'm not sure it's a total failure because so much has converted you know yeah well and i'm not too sure that it's actually not a success more than a failure you know i don't know what percent has actually converted yeah i i i just i just chock it up to this obstinate Americanism because they sit there and and they just don't want to learn a new system you know it's just like they they won't learn foreign languages they go some you know they expect everybody to speak English yeah uh-huh oh you're absolutely right you that that's a pet of mine too i just wish we all and us down here in Texas of course should all speak Spanish yeah we should have six and eight years automatically of Spanish and i i push my daughters i've got two daughters and sure uh one is taking Latin and one has taken Spanish but not enough of it and uh i think we we down here especially should speak and California New Mexico and all that really sure sure i mean you you look around at all these other countries i mean i mean you look at Japan not only do they learn the metric system they also learn the our system you know and and they also take three languages right right i mean well i mean it's no wonder that we're getting beat out on everything in the world because those people those other people out there are working oh yeah yeah they're working they're out they're studying harder and they're working harder yeah i mean look who's taking the the engineering jobs and the and the math jobs and the science jobs you know they're all Orientals uh-huh i mean we've got loads of uh Asians here in school just like we do at every other school around this country yeah what are you taking in school by the way you say you're in school uh what am i taking uh Master's in public administration yeah oh well you know my wife's uh a well i have a daughter in college you know and uh who's got down at UT University of Texas i mean and my wife also has gone back for a teaching and English and English as a second language uh which is you know just teaching kids that are have have their native language and not English right yeah and so she's going back for that and so i i i've got three people i'm supporting in in school now and i guess i ought to go back myself i'm getting enthusiastic because they they're having so much fun you know uh i i don't hold out much hope for anything coming out of this Master's i i'm taking it more or less just because i'm interested in it but i'm i'm also taking a uh paralegal course and i i really want to oh that's great do that more than anything else i i went to law school for a year and a half and uh decided well i don't really want to be a lawyer i mean i knew that going in i just wanted a law degree because it would open all kinds of doors but uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh it's just too much work for a uh a degree you're going to hang on the wall and never use so i said well maybe i ought to save some money here yeah so i got out of that and got back into the Master's and then decided well paralegal is really the nuts and bolts of the law and that's what i really like yeah sure politics and everything you ought to do what you like uh you i'm an engineer and even when i was going through engineering school halfway through they said up don't need any more engineers we've got too many they go through this phase all the time but i think you still should do what you want because uh sure if you're good at whatever you are you know and there's employment yeah i mean  you can go ahead and start if you want uh well um the budget's an interesting issue uh particularly since i'm pretty much a libertarian and an anachro libertarian at that uh so i would basically say the way to fix the budget is to uh cut and eliminate taxes charge user fees for things that uh are absolutely necessary and to be allocated fairly that way and um i'd say ninety percent of the budget has no business being there i can agree with that and uh i know one thing we we need to do a lot of spending cuts instead a lot of raising taxes because that's what's really hurting everybody's goat uh-huh uh yeah i think i think a lot of people fail to realize but you know the government doesn't generate money you know they may print it but that's not really the way money is made it's it's made from people working and doing things that are productive and government's the net cost and government doesn't produce anything that's right so uh a dollar tax isn't isn't a dollar that can be you know that that makes more bread or anything else it's uh it's lost correct that uh i guess the uh the big thing about that is the fact that they're spending someone else's money it's not like it's they're out of their own savings account uh-huh uh-huh and that's another quagmire that really hurts us absolutely yeah yeah i mean it's it's real easy when you go home and and you think gee you know i'd like to have a mansion and a yacht isn't it nice i can make my neighbors pay for it uh-huh but but uh you know i mean the real world doesn't work like that or at least it shouldn't but it seems to in government isn't the basic needs of the government in the first place is to protect and what is the other one basic services is to protect and i don't know about providing all the other services that they do i mean even i i guess the uh the latest uh fire they came under was whenever they were providing a uh a tribute to um Lawrence Welk hum oh that's right contributing five hundred thousand to that's right restoration to his home i think that was called back because of all the flack they received but but that's the another one of the big examples of why we're in such dilemma uh-huh well even just the general funding for the arts uh in humanities and then you know they get into these censorship issues and everything else i mean right the art's in humanity should be privately funded i agree um a lot of these social welfare programs i mean that's why they're things like United Way is when you and i think that those are important but we give our dollars to them and it shouldn't be a government responsibility uh-huh but the government i think is supposed to be doing is is defending our rights right no more and no less and the power given to the IRS is just astronomical and oh yeah that's awful when you sign your ten forty form you're signing a away you're rights i mean your your rights to uh uh protect yourself uh-huh and that shouldn't be that way either uh the power given to those people is just well beyond it should be uh-huh and uh the really what given it was given to them by Congress yeah but Congress never really had the right to give it to them is the is the real argument right um yeah it's it's so i don't know i mean so it i mean getting back to the budget it's i guess the the fundamental thing is to give people a concrete get people to agree on a concrete idea of just exactly what government is supposed to be doing for them no more no less and cut government back down to that size yeah it's it's it's an enormous enormous bureaucracy though it's going to take probably years to really get that in to order too uh-huh because everybody will want that pet project oh sure and and there's going to be a lot of you know cover your ass and you know well you can cut his program but not mine and and entrenched bureaucrats that don't want to loose their jobs correct and all the uh unnecessary military installations yep yep will have to be probably scrapped uh-huh but that's going to be difficult uh-huh but we may we may need a constitutional convention really the biggest way yeah uh probably will it's the only way it's going to change is for us to have a better budget for running this country is for everybody to get involved and right now i don't see that happening yep not at the moment uh-huh or not at this short time period right i agree so my you have some pretty good ideas there um well it's been nice talking to somebody with who uh basically agrees with me yeah well i'm um i voted libertarian this last election i mean in most uh did you some of the boxes you know uh-huh i'm really am interested in getting most of the incumbents out yeah absolutely i think the republic rats have uh driven this country downhill for too long yeah well all parties too are responsible it's not just one particular one right that's why i said republic rat oh i see i see yeah well now that we have aired our views in such an open way yeah well it was good talking to you you too have fun up there you too hope to talk to you again maybe okeydoke bye-bye  and all right what have you seen okay the latest movie i've seen that i thought was fantastic was Dances With Wolves that's i knew you were going to say that i wanted i want to go see that oh man i i just finally ended up going to see it uh and one day my husband had the kids and i just went because we couldn't we could never get to go see it together because it's so long by the time we had a babysitter for that long gosh so i finally just went to see it and i just thought it was fantastic yeah i i i watched uh Costner on the Academy Awards i was really happy that he got i was hoping he was going to get Best Actor uh but he he he did pretty good on that one yeah yeah that was quite a the buffalo scene in that thing was so real it's like i mean it just blew me away yeah yeah i'd i bet yeah there several of them that are out right now that i want to see uh Dances uh Silence of the Lambs yeah uh i'm i'm afraid to go see that one that one looks so scary just from the previews i thought gosh i'd probably have nightmares for the next six months nah nah nah i mean that's what people it's supposed to be good though i know some friends who went to see it yeah they said it was really riveting yeah well you know they they that's what they said about The Exorcist you know no no it's terrible you'll have nightmares you know i watched last weekend me and my roommate we we laughed about it well you're not a thirteen year old i don't know i saw it when i was a kid and i thought oh man well i'll tell well i guess i i guess it was because i'd read the book before i saw the movie oh uh-huh and the book to me was far more frightening than the movie was yeah he's a very good writer and he had a way of putting you in that scene you know it was oh really huh gosh oh boy yeah and of course i was i was living alone at the time and it was late at night and scary and you know you start hearing noises you know oh gosh call the crisis line yeah i bet and there's rats in the attic you know oh gosh uh let's see there was a couple of others that are out and i can't remember i saw one i thought was crummy with that new uh Michael J Fox movie The Hard Way where he plays a a actor that's uh like the huh yeah i i didn't i didn't even like the previews on that oh i know it was well i ended up at the theater and there was didn't seem to be anything else on i wanted to see so i'll try that but it wasn't worth anything i didn't care for that at all no i i don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway yeah well the last two i saw him in one of those Back to the Future Part Three deals and that was crummy also i didn't think that was any good so yeah i saw the original Back to the Future and then i i know i hardly ever go see a sequel yeah i mean i think i think the only i've ever seen a sequel was Two Thousand and One oh boy uh Two Thousand and Ten was far better yeah yeah Two Thousand and One was a good movie if you had read the book well i hadn't read it and i couldn't figure what was going on half the time so yeah no nobody could figure it out i mean the the book was so much uh there's just things all you can do is put it in words you can't put it in pictures and a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you could say what is this yeah yeah yeah you know what's the significance of the apes you know yeah yeah i should probably go back and read the book now that i just saw the movie again not too long ago oh the book is really good i mean i i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again and that's one of them it's it's so well written wow huh huh huh well i have one i bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids Otis and Milo oh you're right i haven't oh that is that is the most precious movie it has was to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life and it's all this it's the story of this little cat and dog and it's not like cutesy it's just uh it's just so realistic everything they do you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things and it was huh oh those a real dog and cat huh a real dog and cat and all the other animals they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised and then the cat gets um on this treacherous journey he climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river and he winds up all over creation i don't know where in the world it is somewhere in China somewhere i think that it was filmed huh but uh it's just really an incredible thing sounds sounds sort of like The Incredible Journey yeah it was pretty wild and of course the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it uh-huh but there's no you know nothing else to keep it going but it really keeps huh keeps me going i i've seen it twice now yeah that that sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film huh yeah it was like the best of the Walt Disney ones Walt Disney's kind of gotten worse in my opinion in the past few years oh yeah not anymore i mean i i i was raised on Walt Disney films you know yeah Old Yeller uh Big Red yeah all those old good ones that you you know wish they had on more now but yeah when i was a little kid i saw The Incredible Journey on Christmas Eve and it was so good oh boy hm it was so good that i had forgotten that it was Christmas Eve i mean that's something for a kid that's pretty good really and that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time i'll tell you let's see what are some other ones i've seen lately i'm trying to remember i can't oh i just saw one on the video oh um have you seen The Gods Must Be Crazy Part Two no that is a riot yeah the first one was really good but the second one is really good too i was really surprised is it yeah i didn't much care for the first one maybe that's no i thought it was funny but that's my sense of humor i guess well i i'll have to go get that one i guess it's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore and i'm just i guess i'm just middl e America or something i just go to be entertained and yeah it's it's and not really interested in some of the like the Terminator or some of the Schwarzenegger stuff i just yeah i i get so tired of you know these you know sequels number nine number ten number fourteen yeah Freddy's Revenge Part Twenty Five or whatever yeah you know yeah you know Freddy Eats a Nuclear Warhead you know i i'm just yeah i never yeah i i'm so sick and tired of that i just can't believe it it's like Rocky films i i haven't seen a one i can't stand Stallone yeah yeah i've never seen any of those yeah i can't either he seems so macho i just yeah and i i was afraid that Rambo was going to do the same thing that Rocky was going to do you know go into fourteen hundred episodes yeah yeah now i don't i hardly ever watch TV if i ever get the hankering to see something i've got i don't know maybe about thirty or forty movies and i just yeah when they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can yeah i don't even rent them you know i i figure if i find a movie i like i'll buy it because i just watch them over and over again that's like my husband does that he can watch them over and over and i'm there's very few i would want to see that many times so he he once he has one he likes he likes to watch it over and over yeah i yeah my my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is uh Excalibur i i loved that film um oh yeah that was a good one i haven't seen that one in a long time it's just so well done and i lived over in England for four years that was the first place i ever saw it and it was just gosh it was so good yeah oh boy uh-huh it was it was filmed in Ireland oh huh and they got pretty scenery in Ireland yeah it's nice yeah i bet gosh and i i've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was oh boy so that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that yeah it was yeah it was unimpressive to look at i mean the whole thing was about the size of a a medium house yeah it wasn't no oh really well when i was in England years ago and i went to to like Shakespeare's and you know Stratford-On-Avon and all that and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it because it was so short the ceilings were so short but oh yeah yeah yeah yeah there's some nice stuff over there to see i i spent four years traveling around and didn't see you know hardly anything i just yeah yeah oh boy i need to go over there and stay about twenty years so i can just travel go around all the places Stonehenge of course you know every everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge yeah yeah yeah okay big deal here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field okay it's boring did you see any movies over there i remember i went to see Don Quixote over there when it came out it came out right around the time with Sophia Loren and that was a riot to see that you know something i come to think of it i don't think i went to the movies one time yeah because when you're touristing you probably don't want to take the time to i uh where i lived uh it was a little town called Newmarket go see a movie but about seventy miles north of London and there was another town called Barry Saint Edmunds about twenty miles away from us and they had a little uh theater company huh oh boy uh-huh there and we use to go go out to that about once a week yeah a really nice place you know amateurs but really quite good uh but that was interesting course used to oh boy yeah that sounds great go to London quite a lot and see shows down there yeah uh but other than that i just didn't have time to go to the movies you know yeah never show any anyway anything that i ever wanted i rented a lot of videos because the closest movie theater was Barry Saint Edmunds and who wants who wants to drive twenty miles to go to the movies uh-huh oh boy probably some of them did a lot of a lot of people did but it would have to be a good show yeah it's hard to know what the good movies are anymore because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by and yeah yeah i i use they they they have all these neat phrases you know you know you know like critically acclaimed that's what they when the thing hasn't won any award yeah oh i see you know they can't it's kind of like waterfront property or something if you're you know if you're two miles away from water yeah yeah yeah from Love Canal water view waterfront property here at Love Canal you know yeah but you know critically acclaimed oh good grief give me a break that's what i mean there's a lot of reasons why i don't go to movies and primarily i mean i now i'm probably going to going to upset you but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me uh-huh
