 all right so we started recording already uh i guess i don't know it's the first time i've made a phone call on it oh so you pressed one okay so i guess we're supposed to start talking uh what kind of books do you read right i read uh a lot of Steven King Dean R Koontz uh some Danielle Steel my aunt got me hooked on those um-hum um-hum so it's mostly all novels okay so i yeah they're all novels i'll read some of classic too oh like what um well i like The Grapes Of Wrath by Steinbeck an i like um uh yeah i like that i like Steinbeck a lot a A Rose For Emily by Faulkner that's one of my favorite i have never read a lot of Faulkner oh and this this is more of a play or something that it that it was from that that i saw and i read the book from that oh cool and by the way my name's Bill i'm from North Carolina i'm Doug i'm from Pennsylvania um um i let's see what kind of books do you like to read um well a bunch of stuff i guess um fair number of novels but mostly shorter ones and like i don't really like the you know six hundred page long Stephen King novels and all that right i really have to be in the mood i i read one like maybe once a year of those um-hum no like i like say uh Richard Broudigan a lot um okay he's um i've never read anything by him he's dead now but he was really a pretty amazing writer he wrote books that were like pretty short and pretty easy to read you know like written at a third grade level or whatever but they were still very heavy and philosophical also very funny like he wrote Trout Fishing in America yeah okay so that's anyway and um i read a lot of nonfiction books too um let's see i like to read read a lot of nonfiction history when Civil War era and um-hum and that kind of thing i i found that real interesting i'm reading The Lion and the Wind right now and that was on TV it was uh uh-huh now what's that sometime during Teddy Roosevelt's time um-hum and um about about American woman that got kidnapped in um Morocco yeah uh this is when they were having their revolution or whatever and Teddy Roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a kind of a crazy man um-hum yeah surprised me i had no idea that he was like that um-hum what how crazy well just like some some uh one quote that he had was that he thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle and it should be a grizzly bear because he liked the to uh to to hunt grizzly and stuff like that i see so it was it was i saw the movie and that's what uh made me want to read the book Candice Bergen was in the movie i'm a real big fan of hers so um-hum yeah cool see i also read a lot of books about music because i'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things um-hum what i like i like to read some of the philosophy stuff stuff stuff um-hum like let's see and even like reading some new age things things that i don't quite believe in like here on my shelf i have a book called Journeys Out of the Body yeah i think that i'm fascinated by that yeah i'm fascinated by that it's all about how to have out of body experiences and all of that um-hum yep that and and uh even stuff about not like ghost stories but real encounters with ghosts and supposedly haunted houses i like i'm kind of a doubting Thomas and i like to read stuff like that um-hum some of it really freaks me out yeah um-hum you're right definitely um and i like to read um i like to read some self help books like um i read Dianetics once once i got past all the gibberish on it and uh did you like it it was okay it it it it took me a while to really get into it it didn't help me that much but uh i think once you're set in your ways you're set in your ways um-hum i see yeah um then i one interesting real interesting book i read recently was when i was looking for a job i read How to Get the Job That You Wanted and it it had real good tips in it and um-hum i got the job that i wanted by applying the the methods that that they  feel about um the Russian situation right now well i am more uh more scared than than ever actually by it because it to me if you look at the uh situation in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe it closely parallels the situation around the turn of the century with the fall of the Ottoman empire um-hum um it is very unstable right now yeah and there's a the huge power vacuum and no one to control the local economies over there the inner uh trade between those republics and the satellites uh or what used to be the satellites of the Soviet Union and i'm afraid that it's just going to gonna have regional right infighting just like there was before World War One and we're going to be stuck in another war yeah i'm it's really scary because i you know i i had a conversation or i heard it over a conversation that they had with Gorbachev on the news uh-huh stating that he needs to get you know like a United States set up over there because they're not gonna make the winter without the food and the electricity right and if they don't if if people don't have food and electricity they're gonna go after it somehow and they're and they're gonna fight it out instead of doing it calmly like he's trying to have done now sure right um i went over to the Soviet Union uh about three years ago oh really and it was very sad they it the economy over there is very poor um yeah and it's worse now oh yeah and when we went over there we were not allowed you know off this bus or you know into the you know onto the streets or anything like that well when i went i did anyway and i got out and um um-hum um you know yeah i know it we barely got back but um rebel you we went into the black market where kids our age were you know i'm twenty three uh-huh yeah and we went down there and these kids wanted anything that was made that was American Lee jeans your coats your shoes anything that you brought with you and they'd give you things uh-huh because they wanted these clothes and they looked just like we did because they would ask for these clothes and stuff so after you came out it was very sad people were in the real drab clothing and whenever you bought something you'd have to go through four or five lines to get it right and it was you know really sad to see that but um yeah it it's something else over there everything's breaking down when we the motel we stayed in you know you could only stay in American hotels sure and uh um the we didn't have water for four days and when we did get it it looked like apple juice it was awful and and you know to see how they live over there oh God hey wait a minute the water comes out here it it looks like that too right and it was just real sad to see it that way but um you know like our tour guide was a sixteen year old girl um she was married and living with her parents and you know they live in the apartment buildings around there uh-huh jeez and because she got the job because she could speak English uh-huh so she got to be a tour guide and it was really bizarre because um she couldn't shave her legs or anything and they couldn't get razors and so um she asked for us to go into the American shop and buy her razors so that she could do that and it was just something else to see the wonders of Western culture get to shave your legs yeah you know yeah and and well you know and you know everywhere i went over there it was it was like that but she wanted to do that and and so did every you know all the kids that were our age were you know wanting to be more like that and so it's really scary because there's gonna be something something's gonna have to happen uh-huh so you did this one year in college where'd you go to school yeah yeah i did um Northern State in Aberdeen South Dakota South Dakota no i'm an officer in the Air Force at uh Griffis Air Force Base yeah oh okay yeah so i'm i'm just a lieutenant i'm only twenty four so i'm it's interesting hearing from someone okay of my perspective i always think that my view is always so much older and uh more conservative but uh uh-huh uh-huh i don't know i've maybe done older spent a little more time learning from history than the average armchair uh uh-huh right listening to the TV type of thing um-hum yeah yeah and everybody's jumping up and down praising all this and you you know it great they don't understand what's gonna happen yeah you know there's i think there's only one thing that's worse than the Communist government and that's no government that's right and on right now they're bordering on that because there's nothing there yeah there there really are you know you've got two leaders one thinks he's doing it and one Gorbachev thinks he's you know got it and you know Yeltsin's got half and and the KGB is supposedly gone but um well i don't think uh uh i don't think you can rule out anything like that no you can't you can't they're to they were too powerful for too long and especially when when it gets to the point where things are really desperate then uh then the military becomes a threat as well right and uh right you know there the military still has a lot of power um-hum and somebody has to control all those nuclear weapons it's not even the the situation isn't even is so much  well Charlie what do you think should we spend more on AIDS research or stay the same well i don't i don't think we're uh spending enough so i i think we should i that i should i think we should spend more why do you think we don't spend enough uh let's see um you know to tell you the truth i i couldn't tell you exactly i couldn't tell you what we're spending but from what i from what i hear um from most of the AIDS uh you know just reading about AIDS advocacy groups and oh people like that uh there have been a couple of deaths um lately uh like one lady that was on the President's AIDS committee um that we're not i it just doesn't seem like we're taking the disease as as seriously as we need to uh lot of lot of talk about it but we're doesn't i don't know what do you think well i agree with you i think we have a lot of talk but not dollars and you know we we situation our situation where yeah we're faced with people that you know choose a lifestyle that may cause AIDS but then at the same token there are a lot of people like the children in Florida who didn't choose a lifestyle but there was not help for them right and i think one of the things we can do as far as the government goes is just to dispel some of the myths you know drinking from a water fountain will give you AIDS um-hum using a restroom will give you AIDS yeah but at the same token i feel like heart disease cancer multiple sclerosis where do we put those in perspective to AIDS um-hum well i wonder what i don't know what the statistics are but i think uh it's uh the numbers of of people infected do you know any have any idea what they are what they're estimating now no i don't and you know i'm like you i do not know yeah well i you know what it what the government is spending on AIDS yeah what what i think is that is that somehow in in our most a lot of our minds it's still a disease that affects primarily homosexuals and intravenous drug users but what we're finding is that that that it's it's um also it's affecting a lot more people than that that that there's a lot more um uh yes heterosexual transmission of the disease than than we probably thought right so and you know i mean as long it's as long as it's um limited to those two select you know two kind of narrow areas homosexuals and intravenous drug users it it it's probably gonna get unfortunately sad to say a lot more lip service than it will actually actually dollars and uh it might be that as it spreads among the general population more that that uh you know and and in all these stories about these kids who had transfusions and these oh there's been a couple housewives lately that were you know national news that they had had transfusions transfusions uh transfusions and they you know and they're they're they died you know and left behind families and oh oh yeah yep well i'm in Texas and we have a teacher that died from AIDS oh you you all did in your uh in your school school district or something yeah well not my school district but it was in the state of Texas and it was because of a transfusion and i think that got a lot more publicity because again it wasn't a minority group yeah yeah and you know we're looking at a situation that hopefully can be controlled yeah i know yeah i don't know kind of kind of scary actually it is frightening you know because it could be you or i and then what what would we do we'd want help yeah what are what are you gonna do if you're in an auto accident and uh you had need a blood transfusion are you gonna have confidence in the blood supply i don't i don't i don't know that i would that's true or will yeah well my mother had a blood transfusion about four years ago and i i was scared to even mention to her um-hum yeah that there was an emergency situation we couldn't give she couldn't give her blood we couldn't go down to give her our blood for her yeah and you know there's always the possibility yeah and and i think as long as it's uh as long as it's still people that are thinking that it's mostly even people that that it's almost like because they're choosing to practice those lifestyles that they're choosing you know that's their choice that they ran that risk i mean i you know that's probably i hate to say that that sounds cruel no but the i agree with you uh that sounds cold cold and cruel but that's probably as long as people perceive of it being that way i i mean that probably explains the lack of um lack of concrete money and being spent yeah and i think it's you know yep  okay you wanna go ahead and tell me your favorite team or who you think will be doing well this year uh well where i'm from the Atlantic coast conference is a very big conference and course we have Duke University that was the national champions last year so i'm kind of hoping that they'll repeat again this year they have a lot of the same players back now we talking about is this the NBA this is college college okay no this is college basketball right we have like Carolina and Duke and Georgia Tech and NC State teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty um-hum so hopefully we'll have a good year i don't really follow the NBA very closely and see that's probably all all i like saw while i we have moved in the last couple years from Utah to Texas and there's so many colleges and universities in Texas we haven't really followed them too much and none of them are our our alma mater so that seems to help do you like professional basketball uh i've uh follow it especially around the play-offs so course i was real familiar with the Utah Jazz and the Mailman or Karl Malone was you know pretty big thing and the Lakers have always been amazing to watch yeah no i i did keep track a little bit of the Mavericks they've not had any good seasons for a long time and have a lot of problems with with Tarpley and maybe now that that's over they'll they'll come out of it but well that's an up and coming team though yeah i hope they do something they need to or they're not going to have any esteem left at all that's somebody you can get behind and be patient yeah kind of like the Cowboys i guess yeah they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons yeah they coming out of it this year we'll see if it holds on but i think Chicago will probably win the NBA again the Bulls yeah yeah they'll probably be pretty good and course the Celtics they're always really really good too with their players that's true be interesting to see how the the Olympics does this year with all the the NBA players playing on the Olympic team that's true it will be interesting and it'll certainly be different so yeah i don't know how close i'll follow them and and the season hasn't started yet i'm usually more at the end of the season person and we need to talk about baseball and so yeah oh my Atlanta Braves well they did well well i really do uh yeah the basketball season supposed to start in the next couple of weeks it's a long season it's yeah yeah it is it is and that's why i've i guess my mind went blank it's like last season was so long ago and i haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet so yeah but this wasn't a good subject but but we'll see how our predictions come true it's a little early we definitely will okay well it's good talking to you good to talk to you bye-bye alrighty bye-bye  i guess we're being recorded what do you have any hobbies that you like to do okay oh yeah cycling computers uh backpacking just about everything you know i generically have you know millions of hobbies oh that's all right that's a interesting assortment my husband's into cycling in fact he's out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the the time uh-huh i am not quite that bad i'm just a weekend cyclist uh do you have any do you do any handicraft type things i think was the question handicraft type things yeah whittle yeah just whittle away my life uh no no i cannot nothing like that i i do some things i've gotten into uh oh i i like to decorate things and i do sweatshirts and tee shirts and i've gotten to where i start have started selling them at craft shows and things and then oh that's pretty good uh you know have have done fairly well at them i've had a a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed but most of them have worked out pretty good there yeah they my only craft work is kind of like computers and you know go off to the little computer club meetings and it's kind of nice because i've made money on it too considering i i work for it a living but i you know i i got a couple of articles published and it's kind of kind of neat oh yeah what what does a computer club do i didn't know there were such things oh yeah just all over the place they just get around and and talk techy or or else uh you know like half the members are really expert and the other half are like really not um-hum and uh we kind of help out the people who are really not you don't uh you're not into into hacking or whatever oh i i think i'm i think i'm a hacker but i'm not not kind the not the uh the you know dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers no that's one of those sports i don't go for um-hum well that's that's kind of interesting hobby what else do you you said you did cycling what was the other thing backpacking what yeah backpacking yeah i belong to a a Boy Scout troop it beats paying United Way i just you know donate a whole bunch of my time to the Boy Scouts and have fun uh-huh well you that's we have done that uh our two older boys were in Boy Scouts and my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about a year ago so we've uh um-hum done a fair amount of that in our spare time also but it i that's a great thing to do you know really have you been backpacking anyplace exciting uh well just last weekend went to Davy Crockett Forest which is kind of out in east Texas oh uh-huh and we go to uh places out in uh uh let's see what's that what's that state north of us that state yeah yeah that one that one yeah yeah and oh that one okay to the the uh oh by Fort Sill there do you uh no to another fort uh a old Indian fort that's out there trying to think of the name of it darn uh yeah no sorry no memory uh-huh have have you gone like to Fillmont with the Boy Scouts no i missed out this last year i wasn't able to get the time off but maybe next year it's a good possibility i've always thought that be a real fun thing to do oh yeah yeah when i was a kid uh we'd do the equivalent thing in the High Sierras and that was loads of fun um-hum does does your whole family like to do it like you you know for a vacation you'd go backpacking uh no not quite because i'm not a whole family i'm just me oh okay you just oh and and you volunteer for the Boy Scouts huh oh yeah i rent my kids uh-huh well well sometimes sometimes uh it's it's better than you know owning on them and making payments on them and you know things like that yeah sometimes i think that might not be a bad idea have uh you said you did it in the High Sierras uh do you ever you know just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack oh yeah yeah uh not recently because you know like the Boy Scouts makes it so that i go like once a month you know someplace uh-huh but uh there's uh some stuff some stuff that i want to do with like Sierra Club and go down the Grand Canyon or something like that so you know they they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go um-hum which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you it seems a little just a tad more relaxing well i probably probably that's uh well my my other things that i like to do in my spare time i'm i like swimming um-hum which is in now i've done that and i i also if i like something i usually try to figure out how to make money off of it  pets no as a matter of fact i do not have any pets you don't no i'm i uh travel quite a little bit with my work uh-huh okay and i love pets i mean you know i have friends who have cats and dogs and all that uh-huh uh-huh but since i'm out of town so much i um am hesitant right to get a pet because i don't you know i i feel that such i feel it's a responsibility right you know and i would want to be a a good pet owner and i do have friends that uh you know go off and leave their pets for what i think are just long periods of time and that seems so cruel to me uh-huh it is you know i you know i'm home all the time or not all the time but um you know i'm home at night and everything and i do have a Siamese uh-huh cat and we lived up in South Dakota and i got her there at the Humane Society yeah somebody had dropped her off but um she's got a crooked tail and the whole bit yeah well you know it's so so often the uh the animals that come from the pound are the best ones uh-huh oh she's great she's you know she's a character she'll sit with anybody she'll play with anybody yeah and she's you know a a great cat well you know it's it's funny i mean i i know i really i'd like to have a pet i'm single and i know that you know there's a great therapeutic value uh-huh uh-huh uh but like i say i'm i'm at this particular juncture in my life i i don't feel i would be a you know a good uh uh parent if you will for a for a pet but i know my parents um had had uh right a pet for years and then they that dog died and they went for several years that they didn't have a pet and now they've got a German Shepherd that they are just nuts about uh-huh uh-huh oh great and it's you know and it's great to see that because and you can just see that that you know it adds something to their lives yeah it's it's great my husband is gone a lot um-hum and so she's great to have around good company you know when i'm you know sitting here by myself and and have somebody at least something in the house you know besides sitting here by myself right right but that's a good thing i think when people are alone a lot have you ever then i think they're a great thing have you ever thought of getting her a companion cat no she's one that will not handle another cat is that right very territorial huh right um when they had her at at the Humane Society she was okay as long as she was by herself uh-huh but as long as soon as i what i'm thinking as what they're thinking is that she was in a in an environment with a lot of cats uh-huh and what their thing is she got the broken tail with from a cat fight uh and um it looks like well she was declawed and everything when they took her there and they just found her on the step and uh they're thinking that she they couldn't handle her being with the other cats uh-huh and so they left her there and so i got her and you can tell when she's around other cats she'll pick a fight real fast yeah but as long as she's by herself with us it's no problem she's really she's great with people how old was she when you got her one year old yeah was that i mean that's one of the things i've often wondered about if you get an animal that you know i i always think about the idea of getting them whenever they're very young so it's i kind of always kind of wonder how well they adjust or how long it takes them you know as an adult uh-huh uh-huh uh she adjusted the that same day no yeah she was great you know she she said this is home huh yeah she says this is home she knew right where the bed was she laid on my pillow she you know did everything she laid on me on my stomach and you know went right to the cat litter box and where that was and she was great that's great yeah yeah i i think she was a good cat it's just that the other cats were a problem for her yeah i have a friend who has a uh a cat that she got from the pound uh-huh well actually i take that back she didn't get it from the pound she found it in her yard okay and you know and it was just the poor cat was just a mess it was the most horrible looking thing and of course her heart went out to it and she started feeding it and the next thing you know she had a cat oh really uh-huh um uh-huh and it turned into a beautiful animal long hair lot of hair and an odd markings and i think it you know is a Heinz Fifty seven variety but really a a handsome cat oh great oh but the crazy thing about it is this cat has a severe allergy to fleas oh really so she has to she she bathes the cat and the cat with this special you know uh uh formula medicine that the vet gave her and which i had never heard of anyone bathing a cat but it you know uh-huh oh fairly regularly she bathes this cat and the cat you know is not not particularly crazy about it but at the same time has kind of gotten used to it uh-huh oh yeah and it sits really wild i couldn't i couldn't believe it whenever she was telling he well i got to you know bathe my cat oh my mom has a Himalayan and she's grown up with ten kids in the house and she has no more kids and so this cat is just her baby uh-huh and it's a Himalayan longhair you hear of that cat having beauty appointments hair appointments she goes gets her hair done and comes home with a bow and the whole ten yards and it's just great my mom takes it she thinks this is great you know uh-huh yeah but she just you know she the cat just loves it She sits there and gets her hair blow dried and everything and yeah they said this uh friend of mine in Dallas started off with just a couple of cats it's just funny uh-huh now i think she's got three or four cats and a dog oh real ly  supposed to talk about boats have you got a boat no i don't do you no i don't i i've had one for quite a few years but i've i've not had one the last couple of years oh really but it's something i've always enjoyed do you do you like boating yeah yeah i love them but uh my children all have been grown for a couple years and we were using it less and less and less so we decided to sell it and well i heard that's the second happiest day of your life what's that the day you sell your boat oh no now i loved having a boat no i just heard that that's just a joke i guess i loved having it no oh okay first best day is the day you get and the day you get rid of it but oh yeah i'd like to have one i just don't know if i'd have the time to use it yeah yeah a guy just you know he needs his weekends free or yeah to be able to use it or a day during the week or something but but no i guess for the cost of them you don't really it's hard to get i don't know i felt like i got my money's worth out of mine i had bought it used and kept it uh i don't know ten years and got within uh did three hundred dollars of what when i sold it of what i'd paid for it and had it all those years you know uh-huh so they hold their you take care of them they hold their value real well really so you know you couldn't complain about that did you go fishing no no it was a uh big boat big ski boat type thing oh okay i had a hundred hundred sixty horse uh Mercruiser in it inboard outboard oh wow oh i did fish out of it occasionally but i'm not too much of a fisherman really and uh but i but i did enjoy owning a boat would recommend it to anybody and uh yeah i like to fish uh but uh and now sailing i've never been sailing have you been sailing uh yeah i've sailed some i just like uh fourteen foot Sunfish uh-huh i've never tried i've always thought i bet that would be more fun but i'd want to be with a skilled sailor but it it nothing big yeah really well they offer classes out at uh Ray Hubbard yeah well i i've always thought i'd like to i've never wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it you know yeah and at this stage of the game i'm not that interested in it anymore oh okay we go out with friends on the we go to the lake just about every weekend down at Mount Vernon and uh my parents' next door neighbors have a big barge and we go out and take them out on their barge they're getting kind of old and they like us to take them out on their barge quite often so we we get out on the water occasionally you know okay oh that's nice yeah but uh uh anyway it's it's fun i i do enjoy the lake but uh once the children were grown and we'd go down there and i'd get the boat out on the you know Saturday and we'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much it's such a pretty lake down there we'd enjoy it so much and i'd say well i'm gonna leave the boat out because uh we'll probably do this again tomorrow it got to where the tomorrow the boat was still sitting there and we never did go out again and i'd have to go load it up the next day and where is that uh Mount Vernon Cypress Springs Cypress Creek Creek Springs yeah okay that's south of here yeah it's down at Mount Vernon okay it's probably the prettiest lake in the state of Texas really yeah it's just a hundred miles from here huh what do you take i thirty five uh no you go down i uh uh you uh you go down uh yeah thirty thirty thirty it's east of here oh okay east of here hundred miles due east of here all right and uh yeah it just we just moved down here a couple years ago so did you where'd y'all move from Colorado Springs oh did you how are you liking it yeah oh we love it up there well good that's where i grew up so yeah uh-huh but uh we're we like it down here pretty good oh i think you'll like it better but of course it's hard when you don't have any family around yeah especially we got two kids that are under two and yeah uh-huh it's kind of tough when my folks call and they want to see them yes it's hard on the folks your folks too i know they're all yours and your wife's folks still live in Colorado uh-huh yeah uh there supposed to be uh some people from moving down here from Colorado Springs for TI so oh really yeah supposed to be yeah that's right um do you work at TI i don't no uh a friend of mine's dad is was a program manager up there and he just moved down here to McKinney uh-huh uh-huh what do you i guess it's he's working at McKinney uh-huh yeah i don't either my wife does okay but it's a good company but anyway we're supposed to be talking about boats so back to boats so tell me the last time you went for a boat ride well actually i went uh canoeing down the Brazos this weekend oh my gosh now that had to be that's boating that had to've been fun it was fun it was fun  um i kept a monthly budget for so long i don't have one now but i sort of know where it is i know where my expenses are and how much i have to cover them how about you well i don't have anything um a budget written down per se but however i i know exactly where my money goes for the most part as far as expenses yes um-hum uh-huh yeah do you do oh yeah i think in this day and time we need something like that don't we yes i keep hearing that we're supposed to pay ourselves first and set aside our savings first are you are you able to do that um-hum that helps doesn't it yes it does back when we were i'm i take it you may be past raising a family is that true yes that back in those other days we couldn't do that could we no other things came took priority like doctor bills and things like that um-hum that's for sure yeah um are you planning ahead for retirement through your your uh savings and things yes you know that's interesting because i was talking at someone in the office just this morning about the retirement and what we would like to have when we retire and how we're going to get there yes it's really hard to anticipate in advance what you think you're going to need okay and then try and plan now um-hum because things come up um-hum but i think now we're at the age where it's really very important well one of the things that my husband has he he works with financial things and uh he's been trying to you know he keeps saying well we need to sit and find out how much we want and and i think that's true but like you said it's hard to do um-hum one of the things that we've done towards that is um buy nursing home insurance have you all thought of that oh no i hadn't even thought about that we have investments to uh alleviate some of the cost of our old age hopefully in in terms of uh an apartment complex um-hum um-hum we've been partnership with uh some other people oh that's sounds that sounds good but it's not going to provide a whole bunch of money i mean it it might might pay the utilities um-hum um-hum you know at at that point in time uh and hopefully our investments with TI will help our retirement our retirement years well the uh if you have the retirement fund at place like that they're usually fairly good um-hum i know mine i'm we've gone through some mergers and my retirement has has ended uh the plan has ended three different times this year is that right so that's not very encouraging is it uh no because uh of the changes that came about in the government requirements and then in uh in merger requirements um-hum but um my husband was looking into the nursing home insurance is it's it's really is an investment you hope you never have you use but uh you have to be so careful of what it will pay and what it won't pay when you buy something like that in advance how can you be sure that well i guess you don't really buy into the nursing home do you oh no no it's an insurance policy you buy it's a policy that will pay for your nursing home should you need it um-hum it pays a set amount hum and uh and you talk to your insurance agent about there's special companies now that are doing it um-hum and they set them up i know ours is a set amount each year and it has a maximum amount over a thirty month period and uh it you know it has you need to read the policy and look into what it covers um-hum i guess i'm conscious of that because my mother's in a nursing home and uh i think we we learn from our experiences oh i think that's very true and that brings it more to home when it happens close to home yeah it does um-hum but uh i think one of the main things that we in the past always talked about was not having any major expenses to budget for when we do retire um-hum and if you got that covered i want to travel personally and i want to be able to get around oh yes oh yes don't we all right at least two three trips including a cruise every year at least at least at least you know well it sounds like we have some good plans anyway it would sounds like we do um-hum and uh you're you're leaning more towards investments and things like that to do yours then right i don't know how sound that is perhaps your way is is a is a more sound proposition you know well we do that too you know you can't then the insurance policies are just things to kind of buffer in case of unexpected things um-hum um-hum and that will always happen oh yes but uh the investments are something that you have to plan for and get your there was some new things  there okay i hope we've done it right uh we're supposed to talk about music yes okay oh well that's good because i'm a singer well good what kind of singer are you um in high school and college it was classical lately it's been more contemporary country oh really do you do you sing in a group or well no actually i do what's called karaoke um the oh tell me what that is it's a a thing where you've got a background video that just has the background music the instrumentals and there the video has the words to the songs on it and you can sing along with the with the tape it's pretty neat they do it at a lot of different clubs oh um like Dave and Buster's and oh yeah oh little country bars and stuff and and so you stand up in front of the you get up in a front of the audience and a microphone and and where and uh are you looking at the words uh-huh yeah they've got a little TV monitor on the stage most most places do so so who sees it do you just see it um the person singing sees the monitor and most places have a big screen behind you so that everybody can see the words yeah so that everybody sees it do they sing along uh not usually unless it's a real ratty song it's it's fun well how cute so that way that keeps them from being able to have other uh have or other musicians uh-huh uh-huh yeah it's you some of the places do karaoke like once or twice a week and then they have like there's a a country bar or country saloon i used to go to that they have uh country bands most of the rest of the week uh-huh it's it's pretty neat i like it well that and and you and so you get up and sing it yourself uh-huh um-hum well great i i i had a a music scholarship to college but i didn't use it so what do you do uh-huh well i am a music teacher i teach uh elementary music in Plano and oh how neat oh i don't know about elementary i don't know i think elementary would be good that would be interesting with the little kids huh well it it it it has a lot of uh very um rewarding parts and then the there are lots of it that you know you feel like you're just a bouncer uh-huh uh-huh yeah i i i can remember music back then and then the paperwork and all of that but generally where i am i um i uh this has been the the best situation in terms of not having a lots of discipline problems and and having children that really are pretty interested in in music in general oh good hm so it's really been nice but i think that's one reason i got out of music because i didn't think i wanted to go into teaching and at at that point it was either performing or teaching it was like oh well well it and yeah it it's and i think that's a real valid reason for not majoring in it my boys yeah were good in it and they didn't even even i mean that was the reason they they took a lot of it in college but they didn't go on with it yeah yeah well i after college i got out got married started working or started working got married and i didn't sing for ten years and i just found karaoke last October i guess and i was just thrilled i loved it it's it's neat now you didn't you didn't sing in uh uh during those ten years you didn't sing at all um not really not in not in anything not in anything organized no not even like in church choir it periodically if we go to like a Christmas Eve services where they do the part of Messiah or something like that but that was about it but back in high school i was more of a classical kind of stuff through Wagner and Chopin and and Schubert and um-hum uh-huh uh-huh yeah things that they they have you do during high school yeah yeah the things you have to do for competition well what is what is your um uh what is your voice is it alto or um in high school i was from second soprano down to tenor believe it or not i i sang tenor a lot in church my goodness i kind of wondered i kind of wondered if your voice if you uh might be you know old usually country singers uh or folksingers have lower voices that uh-huh they yeah that's i found a lot of stuff like Anne Murray she i have to that's one thing neat about karaoke you can change pitches i mean you can change the keys uh-huh ooh really and her stuff i normally have to take up at least a step if not a step and a half well is that a bad uh oh they're probably i wonder if that means they've cut us off i don't know heard a little oh okay i i can't remember i've only done this one other time oh good i don't feel bad are you doing this uh as a fund-raiser no my i'm in a sorority but we decided not to do it for the sorority my boss his wife is one of the uh uh-huh the sorority the transcribers for the tapes and he was like do you wanna make some money okay here so um-hum um-hum my it's an easy way to do it well we're doing it in our church choir yeah it is oh now that's a neat idea and it's supposed to you know be a a really i mean they a lot of they've already made a lot of money on it that's wow now that that would be a good idea yeah i proposed it for the uh for i'm in a service or actually it's a social sorority and it's Beta Sigma Phi so isn't that yeah and they decided no that we wouldn't not everybody might be able to make all the calls so i was like okay that's fine i'll do it for myself well i just decided i would do it once try to do it once a night and um uh-huh and i i mean i just started doing it this week but uh the first time we had to talk on exercise and then this time music so um boy  all right are we paying too much in taxes and are we getting what we pay for what's your opinion well it's kind of a broad subject uh i i think there are some areas where we where we uh pretty well you know get our money's worth but i i i also think there are a lot of areas especially in uh big government federal government uh where we're we're short changed uh lot of money spent for uh things that are not used and i don't know i was i was in the Air Force and out of it there were there was equipment at every base i was ever on that was just going to waste it was just sitting and rusting and you know it okay i i tend to agree with you when it comes to government spending there are so many studies done that don't mean anything yeah but we'll spend hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars on yeah and it's nice to know something doesn't work or something doesn't exist but it could be put to more practical use yeah and i i think that uh it's a a tone of our times that politicians uh are into themselves more than they are into you know doing something worthwhile for the people they represent which which is really unfortunate that is true i agree with you in that area um i have a tendency to i'm in from Texas and i read you know how our politicians voted each week in the paper yeah and it's you know it's interesting how the votes vary and what they ran on in platform um-hum don't necessarily come true in their voting in the Senate or Congress whatever and don't really respond to uh people who write them and call them and uh you know unless they're in the limelight and under pressure so yeah i think we get short changed on that right that's very true what state what state do you live in Texas okay what do you think about Robin Hood now that well i work for school district and uh it's it has hurt us a lot um there has to be some way i think to equalize education opportunities but um at you know our uh we we tend to think i think this especially big government tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it and i don't you know that's just not true i don't think the you know i don't think money is gonna take the place of intelligence or uh problem solving skills uh i think there there are too many things that money can't uh that can't that money can't buy that that are important as far as education is concerned that's true what school district do you work for Richardson okay i work for Plano so we're comparable as a matter of fact i just paid my Richardson taxes because i live in Richardson and oh great okay yeah supplemented the Robin Hoods very thoroughly i think yeah i think we've uh our taxes went up tremendously we yeah we've got it on the line don't we yes and it's not gonna get any better don't i mean you know it just keeps going up and up and up uh i used to live in the Plano school district and uh there was a an organization a taxpayers organization that uh finally communicated the message to i think to the people in Plano that you know we didn't want our taxes raised yes i remember that was about four five years ago yeah yes but this you know this uh i think living in Richardson we're kind of spoiled because i think we get we come closer to getting our money's worth as far as the city is concerned i think then probably any city any city in the country yes well did you read in the Dallas paper where they increased the teachers the administrators' pay by thirty three percent is that incredible after they laid off all those teachers that's a that's the biggest mess i've ever heard of you know how can you how can you justify raising anybody's salary if you you know if you have to lay people off right but you know i'm not gonna complain because Plano got we all got a pay raise this year yeah you all got a pay raise this year am i correct yeah well yeah the i think teachers did uh did and i don't know about administrators i i'm semiretired and i was i was an administrator so i i you know i don't get a raise anymore i just okay uh i work part time and just get uh you know my pay doesn't change are you on the early retirement yes oh are you enjoying it yes very much uh course i still i still work two part time jobs so it's not really total retirement hm well it's interesting you know because when you look at what Richardson has done with the early retirement you  okay have you faced uh elderly care yet uh nursing home care for any of your parents unfortunately yes uh in fact tonight i had a dinner with uh my three brothers and our wives and we were talking uh we had a review with the nursing home staff my mother's in a nursing home uh-huh and uh we had a review today and a few things we had to do that are part of it that you don't really like like uh making decisions on living wills and extended care that type of thing so yes i'm very familiar with it and it's not something that is uh yes you know i never thought i'd have to go through this kind of an experience but i guess we all do i think sooner or later uh both my mother and my husband's mother we had to end up putting in nursing homes and they were to the point that they only lived both of them about six weeks once they got in oh really and uh-huh and it's absolutely i believe that was one of the hardest things i ever did um-hum in my life i that it just you know it's absolutely devastating right what have you found in dealing with the nursing homes well they're not every all the horror stories you hear about them i think are true uh yes we've we you know we've looked around and my wife has looked at extensively at all the ones in the area and the one she is in now um there's a lot of drawbacks a lot of things we don't like but again it's no different than everyone and you know the cost of it three three thousand dollars a month when you think about it for what you're paying a hospital for hm um-hum almost the same well even not as much care yes yes it's not that expensive really no uh there was a little bit of difference in in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law um-hum and uh theirs both ran oh i think my mother-in-law's was like fifteen hundred and my mother's was two thousand then this has been five years ago and uh uh one of the things that you know i had discovered is that um-hum if they knew that i came in there at all different hours they got much better care than if when i started out with my mother-in-law because she was in there first um-hum i would go certain hours and they knew and if i'd pop in unexpectedly i discovered you know they did a little bit they did better oh really you know uh-huh and you know a couple of times with my mother-in-law i would catch something not being taken care of and you know would have to raise so i got to where i knew then when my mother was in um-hum that you know not to go the same time all the time yeah and they would and when i was looking for the nursing homes another thing that i learned uh we had my mother all set to go into one and for some reason i just went back and on my own went around the different floors um-hum and i saw areas that they had not shown me and they did not come across as well well i'll be darned as you know what they had originally shown me so uh we did not put her in that one we put her in another one that i i went a couple times when they weren't expecting me and saw and you know was much uh better pleased um-hum yeah with the situation yeah you you know this is the whole point you've got you've got to shop them yes you do i know my mother's in now in a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's uh-huh and um we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric um-hum uh the fact that these people are they're up and around but they're they're it's reminds me too much of an asylum type situation situation and it's very very uh-huh uh-huh does your mother have Alzheimer's she well who knows they call it uh dementia uh-huh and uh we don't know i mean she does not know us anymore um-hum and whether it's Alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows but it's basically the same and her health is not that bad um-hum although she has gone down downhill drastically since this this this last well she had been in a retirement community and somewhere in so we're in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children well uh-huh she we we just did not have the capabilities to to take care of her and uh but she she has gone down steadily since she has been in and she's been in the nursing home now for oh i would say about three months um-hum did she know that she was going to a nursing home did she know that she was going to a nursing home and i'm sorry she no as far as she knew she was going to a hospital um-hum and that she could she could handle a hospital and we says you know mom if you you know if you get a you get better you've got to have the care the doctor insisted on it you know if you get better that you could come out  all right um well uh let's see i'm twenty how old are you Lisa okay that i'm older yeah how old are you older older than you are okay okay we are supposed to talk about places we like to go so i'm gonna and where are you from where are you calling from i'm calling from uh Provo Utah but i'm from Plano Texas oh you are from Plano my sister lives in Plano yes her husband is the new Director of Admissions at uh University of Texas at Dallas oh really oh wow my dad used to work at UTD also yeah so i anyway so where's your favorite place to go um generally we just go on family vacations to Arizona my grandparents live there that's generally our usual summer vacation where in Arizona um Tempe okay i've never been to Tempe that's where i'd like to go so what do you like about Tempe um mainly just being with family is it we just hang out and my grandparents have a pool so we go swimming and um pretty hot isn't it in the summer yeah but we keep cool just by going swimming and it's fun to be with my cousins they're up there also my grandparents and my cousins so that's good uh-huh have been to Hawaii no have you ha yes in fact i just got some reservations i'm going to go for uh almost almost two weeks this winter oh my goodness yes it's the longest well actually i lived there so i was there longer but two weeks is the longest vacation i'll have ever taken there so i'm kind of looking forward to that with wow around Christmas time uh no in March we're going to go in March after my children's birthdays and get all that business out of the way oh okay wow yeah so i think i would like to go to Arizona i mean i was in Phoenix in January last January but it was rainy and icky oh really it was the coldest it's been there ever in January i think it's very cold hm so do you travel a lot or but i would like to go to Tempe do we travel a lot uh some yeah well i've been a i was a travel agent oh i mean i have been up until just a few months ago but i'm thinking of going back to work huh so you know a lot of good vacation spots huh yeah i low i know a lot of good places to go but you definitely need to go to Hawaii that's your favorite very definite yes it is my favorite my husband hasn't been to Europe yet and i'd like to take him there and but he's traveled all over the United States and i haven't like i haven't been down south i'd like to go to New Orleans have you been there i haven't where where do you live we i live in Yakima Washington wow so it's cold and rainy today it's yucky hm but we've had some pretty nice weather we played tennis outdoors until last week so that's a pretty good deal so do you go to school in Provo Utah hm i do do you use NuSkin skin care they're located in Provo do you i'm a NuSkin person person yep i work for NuSkin yeah oh really yeah i sell NuSkin too i i am my only been best customer not only in best but i'm my best customer oh my goodness since we're not supposed supposed to talk about this though is there anything more intensive for the eye area than the eye cream great uh i don't probably maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only do you know i have that too other thing i would use i'm forty two i need something i need more than the intensive eye yeah i didn't know if there was anything else and i use the Celltrex but anyway well yes NuSkin is wonderful uh-huh good yeah i think it's a wonderful product do you use it i do yeah we get free products every month so oh my gosh that's great like right now i'm getting about sixty bucks a month yeah oh yeah free products so i've worked there about a year that's good are they good to work for yes they're wonderful to work for that's great yep anyway so we're supposed to be talking about places to go and you have not been to Europe do you go to school uh-huh i do do you ski i ski yes i've ski you probably ski very well in Utah no i don't actually since i grew up in Texas i've only been here about two years and have gone skiing about three times well well five times each season uh why did you move to Utah you're going oh you are going to school at BYU is that where BYU is okay i know some people that went to BYU that's great pretty good yeah i uh-huh yep so i do like to ski yeah i i said i do like to ski pretty pretty down there huh so where have you skied and it's it's kind of nice being up here just because it's all like a vacation in itself when you get to go if you like that kind of thing sure sure so you're a sophomore or junior i am actually a junior beginning of my junior year you're a junior good for you what are you studying so nursing good for you you sound like a girl that has it together i would just encourage you to do a little traveling though before you get married because when you get married you won't have the money or the time nursing so you think i know so just you know don't don't be in any hurry i'm not i'm not you really should go to Europe i went to Europe for six weeks after i graduated from college and that was just i i mean i could have had that or a down payment on a new car and i took the trip and it was great and um i traveled with a group of sixteen other students actually they there was two other graduating seniors besides myself and we just had a ball we stayed at how long did you get to stay there uh six weeks oh real ly yeah it was wonderful so you should think about doing something like that uh-huh i just had a friend that got back from Europe and she was there like all winter semester  kind of options do you have in your work uh as far as other than salary like the fringe benefits um we get of course insurance paid we get our sick leave and and holidays paid um-hum that's nice uh earn vacation and uh of course the work place is is uh very uh it's a very nice area to work in um-hum um how about you well we don't get much you don't no we don't um we have to pay for our own insurance um-hum and we you know we do get the vacation but we don't get sick pay until we've been there a year um-hum and then um i think it starts after four days um-hum if you've been gone five consecutive days then you get one day of sick pay um-hum and uh um it's real tough the for benefits the sick leave is according according to the status the way you're employed it has something to with the the way you earn your sick leave and uh you don't automatically get it uh-huh depends on your status right uh but uh really can't complain course the cost of uh living keeps going up salaries remain about the same and your medical benefits go up also that's the truth uh-huh if you can get some good medical benefits it makes a big difference it it surely does especially if you have a family um-hum right i don't but i know when you have children and you don't um-hum it can get to be quite expensive yeah i don't have any children but i do have my husband gets um insurance paid through his company um-hum but it's still cheaper for me to pay for mine through my job than it is to get onto his is that right um-hum gee i i didn't realize that so until he's been there a little longer then maybe i can you know get into that uh-huh but a little better but um uh-huh right now well do you think then salary is the most important no i really don't i really think that benefits okay um help out a lot um-hum you know with the positions um uh benefits you know like you said are are almost better you know that's a lot of pay that's true if you thought if you think about health because i think my husband and i went to um get health insurance from an outside agency once um-hum and it would cost just me alone two hundred dollars a month yes to get basic health insurance and if you think about that on top of your pay it makes a big difference i know that my parents recently retired well not recently maybe the last six eight years um-hum and uh they had to uh buy a policy until something kicked in at a certain age and they were paying an enormous amount of money per month uh-huh it is unbelievable in order to maintain it really is and then my mom and dad have that Blue Blue Cross Blue Shield and i think that goes up every month um-hum oh yeah that is just something else um-hum because they're you know at the retirement age and right and that's something too that's just unbelievable i know some of the companies when you do retire you're able to carry forward your retire your insurance benefits oh well that would be great wouldn't that be wonderful that would be nice yes it would but uh i don't know i don't know what else would there be besides your insurance and your holiday paid and yeah my my husband gets uh life insurance dental insurance and um life and dental and and health yeah and then he also gets legal help legal aid oh uh-huh and he also gets like he's entered into a credit union and oh yeah we have that and and all that that kind of helps out uh now that's true now we've started the EA where you can um if you have like a mental health problem uh-huh a drug problem or what have you uh mentally they they will provide services for that now too and that's wonderful uh well that's nice um-hum my my sister where she works has the HMO oh yes uh-huh which is something that's you know it's nice but you know it's great because you pay five dollars and you go um-hum and and your medicine is five dollars but if it's not an emergency you wait three months is that right well to get in um-hum that is um trying to think which one that is but i'm not it's a real popular one hum is it like Cigna or but um Kaiser Kaiser Kaiser yes well we have that option at at work uh to choose that or to stay with our our company uh-huh um-hum that uh TI has desired to administer the insurance program uh-huh but uh you can either go with the HMO or stay with with Aetna um-hum yeah i i'm going with Aetna that's what i'm i'm staying with well i'm just going to stay with the um you know i can go to my doctor i think i pay two hundred and fifty dollar deductible and that's it um-hum but yeah because she you know was trying to get into like an eye doctor or something like that and if it's not an emergency you wait for quite a while to get in um-hum well see now your eye doctor's paid for through the HMO yes yes ours isn't well i don't know about the HMO but through Aetna it is not covered no it's not yeah my isn't either but through the HMO it is oh that's interesting and i think eyes and and about every doctor you could about  Jeri we're supposed to discuss crime in the United States and what can be done about it yes that's a rather rather broad topic they're usually pretty broad anyway yeah where do you live uh we live in Plano um and where are you okay so i'm in Richardson so when i heard the topic i was thinking of the thing down at um Maceo High School in Dallas uh-huh right right that is so frightening it is you know um do you have children in school yeah no mine are already in college now so uh i don't have to at least when they were in high school it was beginning but not like the rampages well i have my oldest is his first year in high school so we have all this to to look forward to and it is really frightening um to think that you can't even send them to school in safety i mean certainly you know you can't just turn them loose in the middle of Dallas but you know when you can't even send them on their normal activities in safety it it's really frightening that's true and uh i really you know they're coming down on the principal but i really don't know what they can do i mean it's just in so much of society with the violence and the kids having access to weapons and drugs and i i really don't know what what can be done yeah well i just i just don't understand how of course in my little world how guns could be so available well i don't either but apparently they just really are um i mean you to me in Plano you would think that would be about you know about as innocent as you could get for for being in a a large area but you know my son comes home and tells me that you know he hears kids talk about having guns and um someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun oh my heavens and i mean it just scared me to death and you know they called the police and and nothing happened but my goodness you know it it could have easily well maybe that's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution maybe so you know because i don't now i somehow i feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen you know across the street or seeing someone get mugged or unfortunately raped and people don't do anything yeah a woman was raped in Richardson i read in the paper oh about a two weeks ago now and all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help oh no but nobody nobody did anything i just can't imagine that um you know i mean they heard someone calling for help nobody even called the police to say you know i hear a strange screaming right i'm afraid you know if you i don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves because right well i can see you know especially even if you heard screams from a house or something not going over there maybe because you know it could be dangerous but certainly i can't understand not calling the police yeah i i just you know it's it's really frightening that we're not we're trying to live in our own little cocoons and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention right well i i think you're right there i guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business but i think that's real dangerous and uh i don't know i try tell my kids just just kind of be aware of what's around them you know and if you see a situation that looks like it could be trouble just get out of it or call for help whichever but um yes yeah well you know the call for help is what scares me now because it it just i don't know people just don't i don't know i can't say they don't care because people just have to care about another person yeah but it's that not getting involved that impersonal society i think we live in today well maybe this thing with with the child at school maybe that'll make people think a bit more and you know take some steps to to correct it i don't know it's it really is is frightening i uh yeah let me ask you getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of bothers me that police aren't doing he didn't have a license for the gun correct i don't know i mean i don't know the details this was not a child that was on the team it was someone that um showed you know just kind of showed up at the field uh-huh um it was a a student age person but i'm not even  what are some of the TV shows that you watch um Major Dad the Monday night comedies on CBS like Major Dad Murphy Brown is one of my favorites for huh for some reason she reminds me a lot of myself it's just the writing i think the writing on that's real good yes i love those yes she is great i just love her uh-huh it is one i miss is uh Doctor Doctor did you watch that one i use we used to when it was on because i i thoroughly enjoyed it uh-huh i didn't did you i guess i never really watched that one i guess by eight o'clock i'm watching football uh yeah i understand that i do understand that no with my husband so yeah that's a big one in our house is Monday night football uh uh yeah well he used to be before we got married but my husband's not a real big football person so my well he is if it's Dallas and if they're on TV but if it's not then we'll watch anything else because he really likes Major Dad and and Murphy Brown and all those too oh he isn't right um-hum well that's nice uh-huh and and uh what's the other one oh with the four women Designing Women yes i like that one oh uh Designing Women yes with the Sugarbakers i think that's one reason i named my daughter Julia well that well and my great grandmother's name is Julia so we named her that too um yes oh really oh that's great uh-huh yeah do you have kids oh okay i was going to say because we also have to watch Dinosaurs on channel eight because oh not the mama not the mama um no we don't believe me we do too we do too yes i love that show it's so cute well when my two year old starts saying that it's like okay we we know what he's been watching too for too long i just i oh no yes no we watch that all the time we do it's a good show i like it and then we watch the Thursday night Cosby and uh um Cheers we watch all the time and oh i like those i that's fun but that's normally on Thursday nights we just kind of turn the TV off because neither one of us really we usually either watch CBS on Monday nights and then the rest of the times it's ABC it's like oh well we don't watch anything else fine oh uh-huh okay uh-huh uh-huh yeah Thursday night's a big one in our house but um uh we used to when NBC had no that was on Tuesday night um Matlock because i got my mom got me started watching that show just because she liked Andy Griffith so that was fun okay uh-huh oh yeah my husband's a big like mystery watcher like the the late night Hunter and all those he really enjoys those uh-huh uh-huh i like yeah i used to like it when Columbo and and all those were on and and Rockford Files but it's like gosh that seems like a long time ago uh-huh well my husband really likes those yeah they are and then we're on we're on a big one with uh Home Front they're fun they're fun yes yes i like that well no i guess you probably don't get to see Northern Exposure then if he's watching football on Monday nights he that's a real good show sometimes i do if i'm at my sister's house she has two TV's that's it's it's a real strange one it's almost well it's like Twin Peaks but funny it is it's it's right and we did we used to like to watch Twin Peaks for the first season it was like oh this is really neat uh-huh and then it got weird yeah i and it was a show i never started watching until like one night i decided well they always say this is so weird let's let's watch it and see if we can get the hang of this like real strange uh-huh huh-uh i couldn't understand by the by the end of it i was just going now what did i just watch for the last hour this this no no who did what yeah because it's you really have to be dedicated we would like tape it and send the kids to bed say okay now we can watch this because you have to watch every scene to kind of figure out what it's doing and it uh-huh yeah because i was just like huh even then it's like huh what and then we got like the Time magazine because we used to order that and his face was on the front half distorted and half regular uh-huh uh and it kind of talked about Twin Peaks and i still just didn't understand what he was talking about he was something else i just it was a really really strange show but it's like well i'm sorry it's gone but i really didn't got towards the end we didn't watch it at all anyway yeah i think it got too strange because you couldn't pick up on it if you just yeah yeah i like the sitcoms yeah give give me comedies i'll I'll watch those i like those i'm yeah i'm a i'm a comedy kind of person um-hum i really do like just those half an hour sitcoms and that maybe a couple yeah well because yeah because you can like turn it off you only have to watch half hour at a time yeah and it's not right and it's always not um week after week and you have to watch every week and you can pick up something the next week and uh-huh uh well unless it's like you have kids and you have to watch Full House and you have to watch Dinosaurs and you have to watch Urkel on Friday nights and you you know right so you know my husband's a kid we have to watch Urkel yeah i understand that did you did you happen to see it last night yes that was cute Pablo Pablo where he where Carl killed his bug uh yes oh yes i was like it's just a stupid bug i know it it was it was something that that a four what was it six hundred dollar bug or four hundred dollar bug yeah but i know i think it was four hundred and eighty something dollars s o they went to Citizens Court ooh ah uh-huh but i did see Urkel regular he was on some show and he is he's a good looking kid he is a great kid yes did you really huh without the glasses and the suspenders and um-hum he is dressed normal and acted normal he doesn't have that high voice and but have you seen the commercial for the Urkel doll yeah i he showed the Urkel doll on that but i haven't seen the commercial for it it dances i was like oh boy it dances it talks it sounds like Urkel oh no it even snorts um-hum it's yes it does oh well he took that on the show and they played that and i was like oh my gosh it these people like they really have lives but it's just kind of strange um-hum but he's kind of what made that show because i heard it was gonna go oh yeah  hello hi hi my name is Leslie hi i'm Jennifer and where are you from Pennsylvania oh nice i'm from Dallas Texas oh really yeah so oh that's neat well did you understand what this was for you know what it was for what we um television shows sure that sounds good yeah okay i i don't watch too many but we can try it are you ready to start okay just a minute okay sure am okay i guess we're recording now yeah okay what are your favorite television shows well i don't really watch too many TV shows other than uh occasionally i'll i'll turn on Donahue because it comes on in the morning when i seem to be getting ready around here oh really and uh so if if there's no one else around you know it's just me and i have a chance to listen to something i'll turn that on but uh just for the for the conversation factor i think but and then i think i enjoy when i catch it i don't even know what night it's on but Designing Women sometimes oh i love that show yes that is great yeah do you yeah it's fun and then there's a new one that started out that i've caught occasionally a couple of times called Good and Evil i think oh i heard they just canceled that i read in today's paper they just canceled that show oh really it is a real different one it's um it's it's different i guess i watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that i have to see it but have you seen the show it's it's new this year called Home Front no i haven't watched that oh it's it's really good it's um i think it's on like Tuesday nights from ten to eleven and it's set in post World War Two times uh-huh and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through it's really interesting oh yeah it's kind of like a soap a nighttime soap opera type thing sounds neat it is it's a good it's really well written is that on what channel what station um i don't even know to tell you the truth oh okay what other shows do you like um i prefer Oprah Winfrey to Donahue oh yeah well she comes on later and i usually have kids around so i don't end end up watching that one is the only problem i have with it i guess oh oh i did watch soap operas but i work full-time now and can't catch those anymore yeah except when i'm home sick and now when i watch them i think why did i ever watch those that's right yeah they're stupid so when i did watch them i was addicted to them every day uh-huh but not anymore that can happen so do you know of any other shows in the evening or something that you enjoy oh um tonight i'm looking forward to seeing Golden Girls oh that's always fun yes i like that show yeah and if i can stay up late enough i like to catch Saturday Night Live every now and then oh uh-huh and right now we're watching a Penn State football game because that's where we live oh yeah so uh-huh it's exciting we're winning so that's really exciting yeah well i think i also course like to catch the news during the evening hours but uh it's a little tough because that's when i'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time so usually i don't get a whole lot of news watching in um-hum yes we watch CNN in the morning while we're getting ready uh-huh for the day and eating breakfast we'll catch our news that way watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like yeah yeah so what have you seen interesting on Oprah Winfrey lately lately i haven't been catching it because of my work schedule um um-hum i can't remember the last time i saw it it's been a while yeah well i don't know if we've talked our full three minutes or not i don't know sometimes they come on and and say oh that's right well today on CNN they were talking about something like this about um learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing helping them get a database for words hm yeah it's really interesting it is interesting do you work for Texas Instruments so uh no no just uh doing this as a fund-raiser for our church oh that's nice yeah so it kind of makes it easy you know to do a little something for it sure because we uh we've talked to a lot of people from Texas it seems so we thought well maybe they work from for Dallas  feel about this well i've i've seen all kinds of carnage and i'm very much in favor of laws to restrict the access to guns i am too um i you know i cannot understand the the argument on the other side yeah i i hear the argument of um you don't have anything to protect yourself with and and all this that i just i don't know i don't know there's a guy at work you know that's trying to get a gun for his wife because she works in a divorce type position and she's scared that somebody might turn on her sometime and um-hum i'm like why do people need guns in their desk at work i just don't understand that i don't understand either now there probably there probably are cases of certain occupations certain actually certain individuals in certain occupations who would but right um-hum for whom that may be legitimate uh right but there whole countries where guns are banned uh i think in the United Kingdom and then in Japan um-hum where the homicide rates are far far lower than the United States i don't see how it possibly um-hum makes sense for us to have all these guns lying about oh i don't either and you can go to a store and pick out which one you want and just you know it's it's weird to have something like that you know i've never been a hunter or been around anything like that that um there have been guns in the house or anything like that and to see those kids having you know like you see on the news these kids like are you in Dallas or um-hum no i'm in Washington in Washington okay well we just had an accident accident here that um a fifteen year old got into a fight uh you know like you always do in school high school you know you always had little fights with kids yeah um-hum yeah well he had a fight with a kid and his older brother who's eighteen came to the school and shot the kid yes and killed him and i'm like what in the world are these kids and then they confiscated twenty three guns from that high school out of lockers and it's like i just can't understand why these kids have guns that's amazing that's amazing yeah it's just awful yeah yeah well it happens a lot around here too um in fact maybe even worse in terms of frequency to see something like that does it uh-huh uh drive by shootings in high schools are you know yeah we had quite a few drive by shootings recently with buses of um you know that public transportation buses and like i think two people were killed during that when they were having just kids were driving by and shooting out the windows yes yeah yeah and uh and then we had that killing you know in Killeen i don't know if you heard about that yes i uh everybody heard about that yeah i think so and that happened and that was something else and yeah so so i'm i'm i think on the scale at the one end you know yeah uh i'd i'd be close to the eight nine and ten area wait wait i thought i i eight nine ten was no restrictions oh i thought ten was the best oh i'm sorry whatever whatever we're down at the same end whatever end that is heavy duty restrictions that's i feel in favor for because you just can't be handing these things out to anybody yeah and and you're getting them sold to people and then they're getting into the wrong hands yeah would you somehow get them away from those who already have them what's that would you somehow disarm those who are already armed um yes how would you do that um do you you know do they don't they have records of the people who own the um guns that were bought isn't there in many cases not uh because many cases they're yeah i know it they're stolen um right underground type i i have no idea what the statistics are on that but um underground type uh selling of guns yeah yeah i don't know how you know it's gonna it's gonna have to happen sometime but it right now there hasn't been a way yeah yeah i don't i don't know this for a absolute fact but i have the suspicion that the gun industry that manufactures um-hum these things and also those who dealers who sell them are a major force behind the NRA and all these campaigns that that stir people up and try to get them to uh um-hum to uh not ban them yeah to to to right to oppose them right it because they have an economic reason over and above whatever their their private preferences are oh sure um-hum yeah it it's a tough thing until the thing has to be won on an economic ground too right so there has to be some way to compensate those who lose and um so that they don't keep you know saying don't ban so um yeah right yeah it's it's tough i don't know what they're gonna do and you know i there's got to be a way to get them out of the hands of and plus for them to when they do have them to you know they keep them in these areas where their kids can get to them and and hurt so you know and they're young enough they don't even know what they're playing with they're playing with something they saw on TV if um-hum and uh you know it's it's not safe at all for um the kids in the home even because they don't keep them under lock and key anyway they keep them in their top drawer or right and then they say well if we unload them then how are we gonna have time to load them  okay what kind of house do you live in well uh we live in a a brick home in far north Dallas and it's uh four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back and uh-huh it's about thirty five hundred square feet well it sounds like ours are pretty similar i live in one i don't have a swimming pool and mine's about twenty seven hundred square foot yeah but the four bedrooms and all the rest of it sounds just about about alike i think it's pretty much typical for this area it is have you been living there very long i've been in the house i'm in here right now about twelve and a half years so you've been there longer we built this one about uh it's been let's see it's been six years six and a half years ago and we subcontracted it on ourselves we bought the lot and um-hum oh really uh had an architect draw the plans based on our specifications and then we subbed it out so um-hum we've been here a little over six years now and uh have really enjoyed it because we built what we wanted to have to live in um-hum well i bet you have uh-huh uh-huh my husband got his big garage he had we have a three car garage but he has a big work area in it and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines and um-hum so he has all the work space he needs well that sounds interesting i bet he's enjoyed having it that way because some kind of hard to find one prebuilt that's kind of fits those specifications he it is and that's why we decided to build we looked at things that were already uh built and the garages were always uh-huh if the house were was large it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is what we have well then most of them don't have a three car garage they're kind of rare um-hum so we put a three car garage in but even if they had three car garages they didn't have a work space all of it was taken up with just car space uh-huh uh-huh and so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts that he can work on um-hum well that my we've just got a two car garage but my husband's got a big space in between the where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop you know workbench and everything well sounds like our husbands have similar interests now mine does not work on cars he just piddles on this and that but he likes to have a spot to keep all of his his piddling things oh i see uh-huh well that's nice that it's not in your house it really is because you know they have a lot of little things of their own and i you know i wouldn't mind having um-hum and i at one time was gonna fix up when one of my daughters left a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and sewing machine and all that kind of stuff um-hum but i someone i don't know it ended up i got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something so i didn't end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would right well we still have a a son and daughter in college that come home and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come uh-huh his parents come and also the kids have friends who come and stay and so it seems like it's always used as a bedroom um-hum um-hum well i've still all three of my daughters are married but i don't know i just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time and some of them coming back home and things you know right um-hum oh i understand well and we've got grandchildren now so well we that's true and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room when they come they have to have a place that's right you sure don't at times i keep thinking though that might be kind of nice well i okay i haven't reached that point yet i've heard people say that but uh my middle son is engaged my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while he's out of college and has a good job so he could afford to get married but uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh is not engaged yet and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while but she's still in college and we're just as happy for her to finish her education first uh-huh well i don't blame you for that that's what she plans to do so i hope so well i have the three girls and then we ended up with four grandsons oh ho ho and little boys are around the house a whole new world um-hum a whole lot more than girls and uh i enjoy them coming but for short doses i can understand it feels after they've been here ten minutes they have already explored the entire house they know everything but they're they're fun um-hum so you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute well i just watch them i dust i never did put things up when my kids were little and i haven't with a them i try to teach them not to get into things yeah um well that's the same thing that i did and i hope i'll be able to do the same with grandchildren i think that once you do that your children kind of develop the same attitudes at least my daughters have they try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up so it's worked pretty well there's i don't really think anything's been broken every now and then we have to kind of go and say now don't bother this you know but all in all they mind pretty well but i guess most of the houses what kind of roof does your house have here i'm getting off the subject well we have  got to discuss movies you seen a movie recently Mark uh yeah as a matter of fact uh most recently i saw uh Dead Again i've heard that was real good yeah i liked i liked it uh i went with a girlfriend of mine and enjoyed it huh who's the star yeah it's oh jeez you know i don't even remember now but it was good is it it's not a comedy is it no it's uh oh i know uh yeah i know the movie you're talking about yeah that guy and his wife star in it Brannigan or something yeah yeah i can't i can't even remember who's in it yeah yeah where they were married years before or something yeah they were they were married and then uh so the let's see who was it the the the maid the maid kills the wife and then the the husband yeah the yeah yeah i know what you're talking about Kenneth Braun oh really i didn't know the story but i knew it got a good review yeah the maid kills the wife and the husband dies years later something and they both come back as new people and it all kind of happens again uh-huh uh-huh i bet that was interesting sounds interesting it was it was kind of strange yeah well i had the i i read the most reviews don't see too many movies we rent a few on yeah we don't go to them but i do enjoy a good movie i guess uh the most recent one i can think of that i saw was uh on the TV on the you know rental was Home Again did you see that Home Alone i mean yeah yeah i saw that uh just a couple weeks ago as a matter of fact i finally got to see it did you well it's been a little longer than that since i saw it but it was the first time i seen it and i thought boy about three fourths of the way boy i thought what a i can't believe this movie is so highly rated yeah until about the last ten fifteen to twenty thirty minutes of it then it then i was just rolling in the floor it was just hilarious yeah i think that's what it i think that's what it is is it's that last you know fifteen thirty minutes or so that people really get into it and they go hey this is a good movie but i was really bored with it for so long that would made the movie yeah it really is it was just hilarious but i did enjoy that well what else have you seen lately yeah uh i also saw uh the last of the uh Nightmare on Elm Street series uh i never have seen any of those they must be good i like some of those kind of movies was this one pretty good yeah um this this last one here wasn't very good at all it was it was only like an hour and a half long hour and fifteen minutes it wasn't uh-huh oh really i can't believe it was so short and uh it was i mean it was just boom it's over and and it wasn't very good the the three D effect that they have for the last twenty minutes of it was uh-huh one of the worst i've seen yeah it's it's uh-huh and it truly is supposed to be the last of that series isn't it yeah it is um the uh maybe it's a good thing they bury it huh well the the writer director of the series is is going on to a new plot of of horror i i i saw his new movie commercial on the other day i don't remember what it's called oh really yeah so he's moving on uh-huh yeah on to another another topic of of horror yeah of horror film well well it's been when you when you when you do it for so long it's all you ever basically know how to do is horror films well that but if you you know if it's probably made him a extremely rich man too if it's successful i guess just keep with it go to a different yeah most likely yeah different territory seem that's sure done wonders for old Stephen King hasn't it yeah really even even even with crazy women that try to claim that he stole their story and stuff like that writing all those horror yeah isn't that crazy i don't think he did do you no he's he's got too much integrity to do something like that yeah it it just that and he's too successful and and too too warped a mind i i think it just happened that some woman looked like you know kind of the character and everything and she decided well i can just say this is my story and sure yeah and they say oh that's mine he stole they're trying to get some money that's all basically all they're trying to do i i would think anyway yeah yeah but uh but i can't let's see i'm trying to think of another movie that i've seen lately and i can't think of i i saw another rented one uh friend of mine rented it i can't remember the name of it isn't that funny you see them must not have been good if i can't remember the name you see them all the time and when you try to recall yeah yeah you you i've i've watched so many movies here in the last few months just you know seeing ones that i haven't seen before uh-huh well it's good entertainment and it's it's so easy to do yeah you can go to Blockbuster and get you a movie and you know three or four people can watch it rather than paying six seven dollars and uh yeah yeah Blockbuster's so successful i we don't go to them we just go we don't watch that many but when we do we just go up here to Kroger because on Tuesday they're ninety nine cents each for all their movies if you get down there in the morning you can you know get some pretty darn good movies yeah yeah yeah but uh but boy Blockbuster lot of people do go to them don't they yeah i i've got a a membership card at two different Blockbusters i uh-huh oh one one would doesn't work at all of them no they they they issue a different card for each Blockbuster it's it's got their their particular address on it and stuff so that you don't try to take movies back to the wrong Blockbuster got to have each oh uh-huh yeah oh i see well and it's successful the way they're running it so can't knock it yeah i i i had moved for a while and that's when i got the other one and then i came back home so i uh-huh and you live in Richardson my wife just made her call she talked to someone in Plano do  golfer well yes i am as matter of fact not a good one but i am a golfer well well that's about the way i am i don't consider myself a good one but i do enjoy it i uh haven't been out all year i didn't get out this year but uh i enjoy both watching it and playing it i usually play a couple of times a month sometimes more but lately it's been just about that but i do enjoy i think the one of the things i enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf courses yes and the the peacefulness um-hum you can get out there and the little critters that are around yeah that's really neat you can just get out there and lose yourself in it and forget everything else in the world except what you're seeing out there that's right and it's such a personal challenge um-hum yeah it really is more than competitiveness against someone else it's it's a competitiveness against yourself and you know it's so frustrating i keep wondering sometimes why do i do this because it's so frustrating you think you do pretty good one day and you're doing a whole lot better you know and then all of a sudden you go back out and it's just terrible well you'll you can't do anything right you know or you'll hear thirty and think boy i've got my game together i've had a par and a birdie and a bogey and then you quadruple bogey boy i'm improving uh-huh and and you think my goodness why did i think i was doing better being down there do you uh get to see like the colonial or any of those i don't i guess i could i've never been to a golf to a major golf tournament i uh watch them on TV a lot oh you really should go at least once you know we've had uh the PGA up here uh and and in Tulsa and i've been to both of them and it's um-hum um-hum it is so much fun to see these players you see on TV to and to hear that ball go whizzing by really um-hum i mean it's it's like a bullet going by i'll bet um and you know to to see their concentration and yet to see them how friendly they are when they're they walk by you you know and and how good they are to their spectators um-hum well i've only been playing like about three years now my husband's played for twenty five but i just took it up about three years ago and uh we play in a lot of couple's scramble tournaments we belong to a country club a little ways outside of Dallas and we have developed a tremendous number of friends that couples do this and you know it's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses both yes yes it is and i you can meet some really neat people the scrambles are fun um-hum they really are i just love them i belong to the country club there in El Reno when i lived there and it you know it it's fun because it's so uncompetitive um-hum um-hum you really on those you really go out for fun that's right and you know you won't you know you're stroke is just one of one or two or three or four you know that's going to make any difference and um-hum that's right and you can just do your own thing and be relaxed and enjoy it that's right i used to when i worked at Kerr McGee i used to play in their tournaments really and uh now that was very competitive really and i enjoyed it tremendously but uh i i'm more i think i get more enjoyment just couple friends going out and um-hum and if if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green so be it um-hum you know we just think well the next time's got to be better yeah i have never played in any tournament except just a scramble they have a lot of them there at the club you know they have A B C D type tournaments and then they they have the club championships and everything with the men's women's slots as well but i don't know i've just never really gotten into that now my husband and all the men i mean they love the real competitiveness of playing for money you know oh yes every hole uh-huh but i i'm not good enough for that does your club have a good woman's woman's association yes they do i don't do much with it since uh most of theirs they have a traveling league and uh most of their meetings and all are during the week and i don't don't get to play except on the weekend i work during the week all time it's hard to be a weekend golfer and improve your game um-hum someday when i i get where i live closer to the club and partially retired maybe i'll uh be able to play a little more but it uh it's it's a it's a good game i uh i wish i had more time to play and i felt you know had more energy to play it too um-hum  we're supposed to talk about crime in the city um-hum and uh seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays doesn't it well uh i uh that's sure um i think i think it's statistics statistics obviously vary greatly i always thought of Dallas as being a fairly safe place well it is but our crimes up here uh is i think it must be in most cities now but i was listening to the news the other day and they said they thought a lot of it the reason it was up so was because of the uh so many people are without work nowadays economy's so bad do you really believe that i mean it it's been up every year for many years and the economy hasn't been this bad for so long has it well that's a good point that's just what they quoted over the news yeah uh i don't know if i'll believe that or not but it it does seem up and uh what kind of newspaper do you get down there what kind yeah well we got a i think we got a pretty good newspaper uh we have two the Morning News and the uh Times Herald um-hum Morning News seems to have the largest circulation i think it's a pretty good it's a locally owned paper the Herald is owned i think by the Times out of uh LA or somewhere um-hum yes do do they do they play up the local crime angles or do or do they but well they don't no not really uh they don't play it up i don't think uh but there there is too much of it you know uh too many homes broken into we had our our fact about uh last year sometime our home was broken into um-hum yeah really so this is a topic of personal interest we yeah we uh uh i didn't think ours ever would be burgled into burgled but so many in our neighborhood had been and uh because we live on a corner and back up to a real uh highly traveled main um-hum street but uh we were so uh yeah so so you saw this happening in your neighborhood and you figured it wouldn't happen to you sort of yeah and i never did get a security system but since that happened i certainly have yeah what kind of system do you have it's uh uh i guess excuse me just a standard uh with the uh all the doors and uh uh infrared thing you know motion detector pretty pretty standard um-hum is is this is this one with some company that that services you and takes your calls and all that stuff yes yes it's monitored and all that uh yeah well is is that a necessary feature to have somebody you know at the other end of the line or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise and i think uh the thing that makes a lot of noise would would suffice i really do yeah but uh this deal that was part of it for you know three years or so you pay the unit off or whatever yes um-hum and uh but it uh the monitoring's not that bad though because uh uh we've goofed it up you know several times you'll hit the wrong key not intentionally or something and and they call back pretty quickly so i i guess it's you know i think it's all right but i to answer your question i think uh uh i think uh that is a pretty good deterrent in itself whether it um hum yeah so so so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system and what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line um-hum well it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly that uh if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway supposedly who knows you know how does it do that but that's the selling point and i think they're probably i think it probably does these things are supposedly supposedly pretty good um-hum boy they sure advertise them you know so many of them nowadays oh sure but uh well don't y'all don't y'all have a pretty high crime rate up there well yeah um i'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's down here we seem to or or not here but the statistics seem to say that i don't know i i think it's the murder capital of the country now is that right yes i would gather probably from drugs absolutely and i think that's the reason it's so high everywhere yeah but i don't think there's anyplace used to years ago you thought well these little small cities and all wouldn't have that problem but they do yeah we've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it uh as anyone you know so so so what's the solution that's a good question i don't know i don't know what the solution is i really don't and all these politicians make make hay over you know being anticrime but yeah yep they haven't seemed to have changed anything the and nothing seems to change and uh i'm not sure that anything will because these if something could happen to make these people not wanna buy it um-hum uh but they wanna buy it so supplying and demand long as somebody wants to buy it somebody's gonna provide it for them yeah so i don't know i don't you know i don't know what the solution is i really don't yeah i don't think anyone does in fact and what  oh do you have a do you have a personal computer yes i do i've had one ever since uh like oh nineteen seventy four i had several since then uh i built my first one from a kit oh A two or one of those L two uh it was an a S 100 bus uh model oh okay uh yeah i don't know if you remember the old uh MIPS computers yes uh well is out of San Antonio originally wasn't it uh San were they out of San Antonio i thought they were i thought they were out of uh uh New Mexico i really it it anyway i may be confused on that but i remember seeing the ads in Popular Science uh i bought my first one in nineteen eighty yeah um-hum uh what kind do you have now uh now i have uh just a regular PC clone oh it's the 8088 uh it's an old one i've had it for oh i guess five years now well uh kind do you what kind do you have well actually i'm between PC's right now i put my i i had an old one and i kind of got put it up on the shelf and i bought one for uh for the family use and i've given that one to my son it's a two eighty six a two eighty six clone uh an AT clone and i've given that to him and he has it up in his room which means i can still use it but uh that's right um-hum it's not readily available so i usually end up bringing home a we have a little portable in the office and when i need to do something i usually bring that one home um-hum is that the laptop type or the yeah those are real convenient a laptop yes they uh they're real convenient but sometimes they're kind of heavy to carry around because you get you know you get kind of tired if you have to walk a whole lot and i guess it's uh it's all what we get used to it's certainly better than to have a whole machine to take apart my first machine was um a Tandy model one or an old Radio Shack model one and um-hum yes that was like moving to take that apart yes sir it's still lighter bust box yes uh yeah uh i i sold model one uh model threes i guess for a while in my store oh did you yes i had a personal computer computer store for a while oh you did um-hum well that at the time that was a good business i think now it's pretty cut throat isn't it it's extremely cut throat now yeah i was uh you know it was sort of uh just before the uh IBM PC came out ah well i know uh my model one i put a lots of you know lots of hours on it but it was obsolete fairly quickly it became nothing but a word processor for me so i could do uh you know do letters and things like that at home and uh you know i had let's see i think i had about twenty seven hundred dollars in that little system because i had uh several the floppy drives and all of that right and you know twenty seven hundred dollars today will buy you a pretty well equipped four eighty six uh that's about right yes you can get a a real screamer for twenty seven hundred now it's amazing yes it's you look at the computer power that the you know the personal computers put on our desk compare it you know with the you know i guess the the first computer i used with a a 7094 or something like that and uh i mean you this is the you know you have more sitting in your desk than the whole building then yes um my little model one is a thirty two K and i made the great advancement of of uh kicking it up to forty eight K memory and uh you know that was just a big deal in those days my first computer came uh i had a four K memory board with with yeah it's four K four K oh did you ever wonder what you'd do all with all the four K well at that time i was programming an assembly language right uh and and i had a cassette tape for my memory yes for my storage i didn't have a floppy and uh it was uh you know you you there was you there was still a press to have more memory i mean grew went from four to sixteen and it made a big jump to thirty two and you know yes i uh i think i paid what did i pay i paid a a pretty good chunk of money something like thirty or forty dollars just to buy the chips to upgrade mine of course they it already had sockets on the boards because they had already uh um-hum you know they they had the board set up with the sockets in it so it it wasn't that bad but yeah yeah you know now uh machine i bring home has two megabytes two megabytes of RAM and  ah i take a lot of magazines that i don't have time to read right away how about you well i normally buy them at the grocery store i get like McCalls and Woman's Day and and Ladies' Home Journal oh oh that way you can get them as you as you wanna read them yeah if i have time to read them you know well mine i subscribe and then i'll let them stack up and then and then i'll drop my subscription for a year and catch up i understand that actually for a while we were taking like Family Handyman and Thousand and One Home Ideas uh you you think you can make yeah uh-huh because our house is like forty five years well fifty years old now and we were trying to do see what we could do for renovations so oh my oh well that's good do you find the magazines help you on that they really uh they've got a lot of good ideas um-hum well we and it it's nice to get i mean at least on those you could get a lot of tips from it which you may not want to do the project exactly like they show you how to do it but at least they'll give you ideas that you can use parts and bits and pieces of it um-hum yeah i have a friend who does that with her magazines and she keeps a file and cuts them out then she has them when she needs them uh-huh that's i've started doing that because i had so many magazines pile up on my desk at work and and around the house is cutting out recipes and putting them in like a photo album um-hum um-hum oh yeah that's a good idea and as long as they're only on one side of the page but that way you know you can do that with recipes out of anything and then little organizing tips and and handy hints around the house and that kind of stuff um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum but i like i like those kind of the women's magazine i guess they're called oh yes oh yes oh yes i think that my husband gets as much out of that recipes as i do on those he likes to read those uh-huh uh-huh well they've got some some good ideas on things that i probably wouldn't try otherwise you know that's true and then you read halfway through the recipe and it's stuff you don't buy otherwise exactly yeah we do that too yeah we also take uh A Progressive Farmer and we uh get a lot of hints we uh we have a a weekend farm and we get a lot of hints on gardening from that oh oh and then the gardening magazines and uh i found out that we could plant uh fall potatoes and i'm gonna wait and hope that they grow so uh i guess ooh ooh my mother-in-law does a lot of gardening and i know she takes a couple of gardening magazines too as well as as well as seed catalogs a lot of those are in um-hum oh yeah the seed catalogs are fun to look through even if you don't buy them uh-huh uh-huh i like to look through just when we go down there that's interesting because they have a little a little place outside of Waxahachie so that's nice to go down there um-hum ooh well that's they used to oh and right where the rain is tonight oh ooh my are they all right yes yes exactly um as far as we know actually i think they're out of town this or they are either on their way back or just got back from Georgia so hopefully they missed most of the rain well good yeah well on the magazines again it sounds like you and i like about the same things i like to look at the pretty pictures uh-huh i do too and i like to look at some of the fashion things going i'd never buy that for that price i can get it at Target or somewhere else and i can make do with something a lot closer um-hum um-hum uh-huh if it's gonna cost that much i'll do with what i already have right or some of the styles are kind of weird too so uh yeah that's a they really are i noticed one today as i was looking through a magazine up again cleaning out my desk and looking for one specific thing and i found an article on um-hum you take this red wool dress knit wool dress and you can accessorize it with beads or with with uh um-hum um-hum you can put a sweater over it or you can just wear it with leggings or you could wear it with all different jewelry and it's like okay um and bells yeah give you some good ideas that would be cute it would be cute but i couldn't see myself doing any of that i'm only thirty but i just still can't see myself doing that no oh well oh well there's some of us that are uh don't do things i i see people come in with the leggings up to whatever and the real short things and i don't know how they but i guess if they feel comfortable in them yeah oh well yeah that's i can i like what they call harem pants the baggy slacks but i can't see wearing just the leggings and a a a sweater something like that is like nope sorry not my style not quite oh yeah um-hum um-hum yeah i was looking at a magazine today at the hairstyles and it was showing what it assumed was i think twelve different styles and they were all cut alike uh-huh huh but they did something a little different with them uh-huh but that that i would be interested in that would be good if i could actually get my hair to do that yeah that's yeah that helps and i course and yeah and course the proverbial diets and uh all that but every book seems to have that diet in it and Mary Ellen's helpful helpful hints and all those now see i like those i think those are fun oh yeah i lost twenty five pounds yeah i lost twenty five pounds now you can do the same oh yeah that's right that's right sure just eating right seven days a week and um-hum uh-huh and exercise and do all this fancy stuff at morning noon and night uh-huh when we have two kids and and have to work full time right right well right and you do this in your spare time while you're talking on the telephone right that's right that's right you're supposed to  okay i think we can talk now okay well we're supposed to talk about the family okay things things you like to do with your kids right and what that's right and i bet you like to ski with your kids i bet i do and i i i don't know and you're from Texas and you know what it is snowing we have a three inches of snow on the ground now how did i know that oh it's been raining here all day but it's so cold oh is it cold like what sixties yeah probably sixties oh jeez it is supposed to be eighteen degrees tonight i was thinking about you all the way home from our class just got home from our computer class hey i mean what are the chances of this happening oh oh jeez uh i don't know oh i don't know there's got to be thousands how many people do you think i think oh that is just too funny oh isn't that great that's just wonderful well i wrote you a little letter on the latest update so that's wonderful oh good yes yeah yeah they they have a board meeting tomorrow so we may know more tomorrow but anyway just for now you know it's just anyway it's in the letter so and your rejuvenating cream so oh good yes i've been wondering about that i know you have been and i just couldn't talk last night i know i know and we'll i need to give you that number too but that's one thing we should do pray with our kids right oh oh you have to in fact when Nicole was having her problems with not starting you know we prayed a lot and we prayed as a family on the way to the tournament and what night did we i guess on the way to the SELA game last Thursday which they're kind of our big rivals and we prayed prayed that she would get to start and that she would play well and she did she played the best i've seen her play uh-huh oh and as consistent as i've seen her play and but we prayed as a family we i made all the kids go because you know all they boys sometimes don't like to go and it was just great and her little friend was there and oh in fact i've got to talk to her and we just got home and to see if she talked to him today and stuff because see he had a soccer tournament out of town yesterday so he had to get up at six o'clock in the morning and they got home at one thirty oh oh jeez i told you she just ran in the house okay and let's see and what you like to do with your kids is go to their sports yeah us yes oh um-hum basketball yeah tennis orchestra tennis orchestra yes um watch them dance golf yeah racquetball we do a lot of things with our kids golf yep is Dave is Dave playing racquetball we haven't played yet this year but we you know the the park and rec center that's right beside us you know it doesn't cost you anything if the court isn't reserved you can play for free oh that's great how's Barry doing with his weight is he working out oh no he hasn't had time yeah he's he's gonna be a while getting settled you know getting things going yeah they're putting in a new dialogue system at the university and so he's been working nights and you know he's been really really busy oh bless his heart this lady over DWA she's so bad keep your keep your keep your ears and eyes open but oh i know well this is a good stepping stone for him it's a great stepping stone it's a great stepping stone yeah so we're real proud of him oh i got a one hundred percent on my test what test my test for my class my computer class that Dan and i are going to we got them back this is from last week so we're i'm pretty jazzed because i got a eighty two on the first one and Dan got a ninety two oh whoa oh and so and then we both got a one hundred on this last one and i thought it was harder than the first one but we studied a lot more so yeah we're pretty jazzed oh that's wonderful yeah and tonight we learn spreadsheets oh see and last week we last three weeks we've been doing data base now we've i work with a spreadsheet at work i do bank recs on it yeah they are neat they're scary at first but they are neat and you need to be teaching your kids that stuff because it'll really help them oh it's pretty darn neat oh yeah oh yeah well we're just really basic basic basic stuff you know and our teacher his wife is the teaching one of the teaching leaders the Bible Study Fellowship uh-huh oh yeah and i and i've had her been and and i thought i recognized the name oh he's just the most wonderful man and we weren't even in his class to start with and then it just i mean the way God works you know we ended up in his class and we just couldn't be happier i mean he's this marvelous teacher oh that's wonderful that's wonderful yeah oh and library went well today yes Harold Reynolds who's a Mariner baseball player uh came to school today and they had lunch in the library of all things oh good uh-huh oh jeez oh no my library got it all dirty and anyway so that was kind of neat and then Adam wasn't one of the kids they just picked at random kids from different classes and Adam um uh-huh uh got to come in because mommy was the librarian you know so he got lots of autographs so that was pretty cool so they had a good time oh that's great did he bring the card his card he didn't have one of his cards but he had his a baseball so he signed his baseball and he signed his shirt and some kid had him sign his clothes signing their hats oh oh jeez  okay well just to let you know i have uh two uh children of my own i've got two boys uh one four year old and one two years old so so i'm just starting out oh yes i have two boys who are twenty eight and twenty four and a daughter who's twelve wow wow that's quite a spread yes same husband everything it just uh but that's great well i guess uh in one of things that that uh i like to do with my boys when uh when i get home is i like to try and spend a lot of time with them you know they're not very old so they can't do a whole lot yet um-hum but they like to uh spend time with me we just oh just do various things nothing really they like to be outside as much as possible if it's not raining right uh but you know the weather's trying to turn now so are are you down here in Texas oh yes i i'm i'm in uh Dallas okay yeah then you know what i meant with rain ah right right right okay uh what you know one of one of the well one of the things i've noticed is one of the trends i've i've noticed is that uh it's always too easy to to just plop your kids down in front of the TV and let them watch movies or or play video games or something yeah i i have can you hold on just a second i have to answer a business phone i hate to do it on this call good morning ARE this is Arlene Lister sure sure that's okay it was just a recorded message on our business phone anyway i'm sorry keep going no no it's okay um so that was the thing that i i noticed that i know a lot of the people lot of friends that we have they have a tendency to do the same thing and one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible um um-hum although it really is very easy to do that type of thing just plop them down in front of the TV and let them be um entertained that way and uh seeing as how you've got some older children i was i'm wondering how did you handle that when they were growing up yeah well there there was not nearly as much of it in fact i i think things were were quite a bit different uh when my my big kids were were little uh you know if if all the mothers were home um-hum um-hum you know the the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around and then when they felt like it they went out to play you know when they were were little like that um-hum right and uh i i think it's gotten ah yeah very different when my second one was little they were coming out with Sesame Street which he started watching and right other than that i mean there was basically there was not educational TV or uh um-hum you know you got some cartoons and that was it but they they were never that interested in it anyway they'd rather i mean they'd take their trucks out in the backyard you know go out and play and stuff but we always did uh right oh just you know to the park for walks and to the zoo and museum we did a lot of stuff like that with uh with our kids and course when they got bigger uh um-hum um-hum they were both quite into sports and and you know so whatever you know they would do we'd go along with and uh um-hum yeah uh well a girl is very different a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping so they're very very different but right uh you know kind of the same thing our you know she now lot of time spent with her she's so busy is uh you know going to you know like last night was a band concert and she um-hum um-hum she plays on her school volleyball team and uh stuff like that but uh we we still uh oh like to pack up you know just go someplace for the day or uh you know just stuff like that one of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at College Station so that's uh right oh that's nice we go down there fairly often you know for a weekend for you know family get togethers and stuff like that that's great that's great i know we'd i'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things and i think we probably will soon as the boys get a little bit older ah um-hum but uh you know for right now they don't you know just getting out in the front just being outside is good for them they like just being outside oh yes yeah i i think our kids just ours dearly loved that you know played bounce the ball or just ah course when our big ones were little we lived up north you know and this time of the year it it the fun thing was to go out um-hum um-hum swoosh around in the leaves you know and yes you know so it's it's very different and and uh right that's true you don't see many leaves around Dallas you know we also come winter time we'd stick them on sleds and uh we had a pond across the street and and from little on uh you know i'm um-hum it it's so different down here where you you go and take lessons to learn to ice skate or something you know when our kids were little you you got them a pair of skates  okay well do you have a pet i have two cats two cats you're lucky and do and oh and two fish you have two fish and what do you have well uh my husband you know how sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing oh no my husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog so we have a black Labrador um beautiful gorgeous black Labrador but to me he belongs up in the field you know in the ranch in the farm and right does he sleep in your house well because we finally negotiated that i was losing my mind um he sleeps in the laundry room and then he goes out for the day but this this is a beautiful dog and he is wonderful with our little girls and he is he's comes from a purebred line and there's nothing you could say bad about him except that i was more of a cat or a small dog person that you could sit in the chair and cuddle right right and this is huge you know of course when he runs around the yard he just digs he doesn't know that he's tearing up things but he does yeah yep and the worst part that i had with him he's he's three now was when he was uh about eight months old and i did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one uh-huh and i left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while i was gone for about an hour and i came home and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall oh my word and it was in the floor and i just about lost it and i called and said come home and get your dog and so he said well puppies just chew when they're nervous and well i wish you had told me you know and it was about eight months later he ate a piece of a linoleum he kept picking at it and i didn't know the the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it oh dear so the last thing he did was when i had set out a whole lot of begonias in the back yard and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch and i told my husband i said you know it's either me or the dog and he looked at me like well you know so he loves this dog and every night when he comes home from work he hugs it and talks to him and he's a good dog good bye um-hum so it's one of those things i'm just having to get used to and that's why i laughed when they called it the topic i thought oh boy do i have a pet oh but i i grew up with cats and i'm very comfortable yeah i love my cats i had one cat for eighteen years i got her when i lived in Hawaii oh before i even got married i had my cat she's old isn't she oh i started to say then you broke your heart well she i had to have her put to sleep last June oh it was awful it was just awful but and she just sat there on my lap you know she just just waited and oh oh bless your heart that makes me feel so bad oh it was awful but her hair but the bad thing was though she would pee in my husband's shoes you know and she just liked his shoes and he'd have to dress hundred dollar shoes yeah oh no oh oh no oh it's just bad and my closet and it was oh so sick oh that's awful i've never heard of that before it oh it's just terrible and once she did it you know then she would i mean she wouldn't if our shoes sat side by side she would pee in my husband's shoes she must have known he didn't like her or something um-hum or the smell or something oh anyway i've i've and i would shut i would bar the closet doors and i would carpet carpet vacuum uh clean the carpets and oh dear it was just awful that was very funny uh-huh well does now does your cat sleep in the house they are they're house cats i uh well i have two cats right now and of course they sleep with my kids my kids my my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed just for the cat yeah oh yeah good oh but the cat doesn't destruct does it see it doesn't do anything oh no i won't i'm not gonna have a dog we've had two dogs see and um they both got ran over after we've had them for several years just nice little outside dogs but oh no yeah were just my kids' friends they would go jogging i they would go with me when i would go running and and the last one got hit um as she was following my one of my sons across the road to the school oh oh no oh that is it was awful it was just and it just it's too heartbreaking but they do dig up and they just they just wreck things and i'm not a dog person they do wreck things well i'm not either i'm not either and it's just been ooh i wouldn't want a lab it sounds beautiful but but he's beautiful but it's just one of those concessions i just had to make but i kind of ignore him now today's the first cold we've had in Texas and it's really cold and drizzly and it's freezing and people are doing their fires um and i brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there and he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square and he's just huddled up like if you'll be nice to me i won't make any trouble you know again and then my daughters both have hamsters oh and how old are your girls and i i they're eleven and eight and i gave in at Christmas and they have they keep their cages real clean it always smells of cedar and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and oh yeah sure i think they're cutting us off oh no that's somebody's trying to cut in on my line and i don't want to answer i'll just wait no i've i've got incoming calls and i don't know why somebody's calling oh okay okay oh okay i i hate to cut it off i think they would cut us off so we'll just wait whoever it is will call back i understand okay well they'll cut us off pretty soon well it's somebody calling for my kids you know jeez actually it's my son i know it is my older boy he never likes to come home from school but anyway that's what we have and i have i've tried to start a fish fish tank and i keep losing all my fish yeah i know how does salt water salt water or basic yeah yeah no just regular water  okay my children are all grown up oh okay well no see i've got two children and uh they're one's uh just turned to be a teenager and the other one is on his way so uh-huh i uh i'm a single parent so i think it makes it more difficult for me to um you know find time with my my children since i work and then of course take care of the house and and all this good kind of stuff i'll bet um so it's a real uh it's a real problem for me i'll bet it is what is the favorite thing you do with your children yeah um the the thing that we like to do the most is to watch TV together and uh the kids like to play Nintendo but i'm no good at it so i don't like to play that's right that's right um-hum you just watch them play huh i i've tried it once or twice but i didn't feel like i was very good at it either my grandson got me to one day but me either yeah they talk about these different levels and stuff and i've never got off of level one yes yeah different worlds and how do you get to another world you know and i i don't even know where they're talking about uh i know i i agree with you so uh but no the other thing i think we like to go to the movies too that's the yeah that's a that's a neat thing so i guess we're all in um you know movie uh fanatics or whatever around here so we like to do those kind of things do you yeah i know when our kids were growing up our we were big into water sports we had a boat and they all skied and in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing and um-hum they always took other friends with them and we had a lot of fun doing that but i had all girls so we didn't do too much sportswise oh how neat uh-huh oh i find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball and little boys do all of those things but um-hum um-hum oh yeah oh yeah see i have a son and uh you know it's football in the fall and and baseball in the spring and and it's one activity after another i i'm constantly going back and forth and uh-huh i'll bet you really are yeah uh my daughter has uh tennis so it's between tennis and and bowling my i bowl so you know we're pretty active as a sports you know in in the family so it's it's really neat um-hum um-hum well when mine were real little they all played soccer but you know that was just for a couple of years when they were pretty small for girls and then they got more interested in other things i'm not sure that they would admit it at that age that it was boys but i think that's probably what it was uh-huh boys oh yeah i i know that uh my daughter uh even though she goes out with the the sports and everything uh yeah she likes to watch the football for uh the kids oh i'm sorry uh oh uh-oh that was a cat that hit the telephone get away cat gosh i guess it's why they wanted to do on this type telephone because there's all kind of activity that goes on but uh yeah my uh my kids are they're starting to grow up you know it's not gonna be too many more years before i uh uh you know they'll be gone and and uh there won't be as many activities do you uh but they but you enjoy them i think the older mine get the more i enjoy them yeah i i agree with you i i do i'm so glad they're out of the that young real young age and the babies um-hum and i mean i didn't i it wasn't that i didn't like them when they were little but the older they got i enjoyed them as teenagers right yes yes and now that they're each of course three girls they're each becoming they're they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them um-hum um-hum how what kind of mothers they are what kind of wives you know oh yeah yeah that's so that's so true well do you do the do your daughters live close where you can go out and how they do things and two of them live real close to me so we we spend a lot most of our time spent with them is they come over to eat oh good oh yeah yeah and bring the kids and we play with the kids you know but uh we don't oh we go camp out they camp out and we spend weekends at the in the country with them quite a bit but yeah yeah um-hum uh-huh uh as far as doing any activity now that the grand kids are here we all just stay around the house mostly it's too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids oh yeah well that's true oh yes oh yes well i know especially when they grow up like that so i'm trying these these last five or six years i'm trying to make them really special and uh-huh uh very precious since that's uh about the only time we've got left they'll always remember it too yes yes absolutely i I think so too i hear mine saying well i remember mother and daddy used to take us to do so and so i need to take my boys to do this or that you know uh-huh uh-huh and i remember the year we went to Disney World as quick as my kids are big enough we're gonna go to Disney World you know there we go i know i know they can't wait yeah they just really can't wait to be able to take their kids where they had fun but that's right that's right yeah so well i still got a few more years so i'm uh i'm hanging onto those and doing as much activity as i can with them do you work yes uh-huh i sure do and uh work full time so uh it it that cuts into our free time right there uh-huh it really does the time you have with them has to be quality time then that's right that's right and uh vacations are very special for us and activities i imagine that they have uh some a lot of homework too yeah yeah you know this being a school night and stuff so uh it's it's in the same old you you know routine of uh you know doing homework and you know trying to talk between all of that and and uh the other activities that we all have um-hum um-hum well there's just so many things to do with them nowadays so and especially if they're active kids like you say you bowl um-hum  okay is it Mike do you repair your own car yes i try to whenever i can i've always been a a i guess a product of a handyman father well i tell you what that's your count your blessings because uh it's really is good when someone can do some the yeah things to the the car themselves yeah there's although i'll tell you you know over the years the cars get more complicated and well that's why i don't do as much as i'd like right yeah because they are i mean they got they've gotten complicated haven't they yes one of my first cars was a fifty six Buick which after awhile i could you know take it apart in my sleep if i needed to uh-huh is that right yeah it it got to be pretty straightforward to understand and and uh since then you know and the closer a car is to a fifty six Buick the the more i know about it and then start getting into these Nissans and the like and i just can't keep up yeah i i agree about all i ever i never was too mechanically inclined but i used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and course they don't use uh points anymore yeah that's right yeah but they do still use plugs and uh now brakes i've always done a lot uh you know changing brakes and i used to yep yep um-hum do i could always do the alternator you know and starter i don't anymore but i have on a lot a lot of times yes yes i understand my last car repair actually had to do with brakes and it's one i did not do myself i took the car my i have a seventy nine El Dorado took it to be inspected uh-huh and the parking brake failed so i got under there and messed with the the tension that um that adjustment to make it to tighten tighten it up and that didn't do the trick and i got there and tried to uh-huh uh-huh it probably slipped loose didn't it but we well actually that wasn't even eventually the problem i i did a lot of things that i i did everything that i could think to do uh-huh and eventually i brought it up to a a place called Just Brakes and it turns out that there's a the parking brake in in the rear there's a there's disc brakes and the parking brake is a piston um-hum deal and because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years the piston froze up so they ended up having to pound it out and one of them they hm oh were able to get running uh kind of oiling it and playing with it and the other one they just it was just frozen solid the so i ended up having to buy one and altogether all total it was just under two hundred dollars believe it or not to get all that done um-hum yeah well it really wasn't quite so as bad as you thought would it was it yeah yeah actually i i think it was a lot of money but i guess i don't like i said yeah but i it got to the point where i didn't know what was going on so that's right that's right well it was a lot of money but you had to have the help didn't you yeah well do you still do much work on them now i do that actually that actually that was just um in in in beginning of September and i whenever i can i do try i actually actually i'd say this i i've gotten to the point where i don't change the oil anymore only because disposal is a problem well that is one problem but also these um these fast oil change places you just can't beat them for sixteen bucks they'll not only will they change your oil in ten minutes and do a fine you know good a job as i can do but they'll uh lube too that's true that's true right that that i've i've quit doing that myself and but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil you know yeah yep that's right and uh but but no i guess it that and the main reason that it's it's quick  yeah they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago well they've uh statewide raises they raise ours it seems like constantly we just uh passed a new one uh fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't go into effect because we did not get the United Airlines oh right Indianapolis got that didn't they right and uh we had passed a a provisional one that if if it did if they did locate here we would raise our taxes but uh at least we thought we'd get something back from that yeah uh how do you feel about taxes oh it seems like a big politics game like up here last year the governor's up for reelection so he said the budget was fine and that the state didn't have any money and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money so they raised all our taxes and now it's election time again so they're trying to lower them oh so they're just talk about lowering them but they never do they just keep raising them i've never seen taxes really go down yeah me neither well actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year and they're gonna lower it for next year oh i guess they figure they're gonna make up for all they didn't get when they should've had a budget i hope they put that in writing yeah yeah they say they're gonna lower but i'll see i feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and uh that the rich are not paying their share and of course the poor can't afford it either but uh i really feel like and and i feel like you know i'm a middle class person income incomewise anyway and uh i get tired of supporting the whole country yeah so do i i mean i'm a a middle class barely but uh i don't think the rich are paying more let not enough i think they're paying too much you think the rich are paying too much yeah i mean if you're in the the three three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month well that's ridiculous why bother working well i don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to i mean i'm talking about the really rich well they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make right that'd be fair now i'll go along with that i you know yeah no loopholes or anything everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever right now i think that would be fair and i you know right no no ifs ands and buts you know no big elaborate laws that say uh you know call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review it's just you know you make this you pay ten percent if you make a hundred dollars you pay ten percent if you make a million dollars you pay ten percent yeah that's the way our state tax is here i think it's pretty fair our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal hm and uh they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate oh so and and you withhold no matter what you do they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough oh great so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out right so now you know when you sign your W-4 form or whatever W-2 whatever that is then they always say do you want a extra amount for state um-hum which is ridiculous but it's been that way for the last probably ten years yeah i guess you you have to check yes or you come down to the end of the year and you don't have it to give it to them right unless you have a lot of deductions but you know if you have a lot of federal deduction it ends up hurting you statewise yeah really and you end up owing you know you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal and you're gonna owe fifteen hundred in the state ouch and uh it's it's just ridiculous but i i don't know i've they just came up with a twenty five percent increase on personal property in in Oklahoma county and that is a chunk yeah i'll say i mean twenty five percent increase yeah  um i think we can have honest government what do you think well i think there are honest people in our government i think it's uh and we do have some checks and balances to keep it honest but i think it's always a real challenge to um um-hum make sure that we have people in there that we can count on yeah to be honest well i've thought about the politicians that go in and you know they say none of them are honest but i think they're honest when they go in they just keep facing these challenges and not all of them respond favorably to them yeah i think there are and have been some things that have been done to maybe make things better you know one thing is the opportunity on our income tax to um allow certain donations um-hum um-hum to uh be made because a a lot of times i think you know people anybody that runs for a political office has got to either be independently wealthy yeah or they've got to be beholding to somebody to help them yeah some special interest group yeah and so you know i think if if there were ways that we could get away from that and let just the common man be able to run yeah um-hum for office that that and yeah and of course he runs into a problem he may not can support the two homes and all of the other things even though they have a high salary yeah but it's just uh i think public service was originally meant for public service but it it's gotten to where it's kind of rather hard to do as public service you know they need uh money to operate on and this and that and feed their family and put their kids in college just like everybody else does that's right and that puts stress yeah yeah well my husband has um held public office for a while and not a paid public office i might add and uh if um-hum oh that's public service yeah that's more public service i guess than public office and it's been a real eye-opener to us course i feel that he's completely honest and um-hum hm yes what all and there have people been people that have said you know that they how much is he being paid and all this kind of stuff to to do things and oh yeah you always have people throwing stones don't you yeah well obviously if they ever looked at our house or our car or whatever they would know he's not getting paid anything but um yeah well uh i guess that that uh it's it's the way people perceive and they perceive from their own wants too sometimes yeah i think that's true yeah they want somebody else in so they've got to find something wrong with whoever's there yeah that's probably true too hm but at the same time you know when i go to the polls to vote yes um i always am real nervous about who i'm voting for even if i have studied the issues and heard what people have had to say and everything because um-hum um-hum um you don't know really know that person you know and you don't know even if what they say is what they're gonna do and what their real feelings are on a lot of things i mean no you don't um-hum well sometimes they don't know that what they say is what they gonna do absolutely and depends on the situation and that makes it very difficult yeah i guess that's a real problem you know i i i don't know how we solve that one because i'm not sure that you can ever especially the the higher up you go you know like a senator or um-hum um-hum congressman or something like that i don't know how you would ever get to know any of those people well enough to say you know i know this man on a personal basis i know he has integrity and i know he um-hum right you know and to go by voting records and that isn't always right yeah or or just read the League of Women Voters answers that they give or um-hum yeah yeah so it's sometimes you just don't know no i just uh kind of do the best you can isn't it that's right yeah well what do you think about um um the legality or making it illegal to do certain things do you think that helps um calling them accountable from a a law standpoint well that would be nice if we could do that yeah well i know uh some of them the Senate Ethics Committee is trying to do that but uh it's really strange that they find someone totally guilty of something and then they go back and talk to their constituency and i'm thinking about one in particular oh uh-huh and uh then the constituency says oh well he's honest and we want him you know oh i can think of one like that also just blows your mind doesn't it oh think so yeah i'm sure we both can yeah it sure does and then they've proved that he's lined his pockets and everything else yeah oh yeah but i  Jay um my kids are are both in college um and i'd played i played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go on the other hand they really decided themselves um what what kind of experience did you have um-hum well i uh one girl went in in state and has graduated and then uh that was um you know that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go and i have uh one out of two out of state both in Missouri um-hum and um i teach uh in a college and so i had they had heard me talk about it and for years that um-hum i didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate uh so that was pretty much uh hm i see well i maybe maybe i'm wrong but i think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and and and the appropriate support environment and things like that oh they if they if they're content there but i mean as far as the education and as far as looking at the degree at the end that uh to it's very little difference is paid to it where you get that bachelor's um-hum uh if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally and if they can get uh um-hum um two out of let's see my son got a full total uh scholarships and so there's uh there's plenty of scholarships out there and so people should be advised to um-hum to look for those and um did did you play a a strong role in helping them pick schools or did you just sort of say listen to your uh guidance counselors and uh well they uh i went we went around my son was a graduated from a Jesuit high school and so he he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university and so there were you know that was limited to um-hum um-hum uh five or six different places and um so he's in Saint Louis U and i guess i played a role in that i i just sort of uh let them um um-hum you know they'd all been uh pretty uh efficient as far as studies and and uh yeah so i didn't have that much to do they just uh they just knew they wanted to go to college and and i you know helped them uh yeah uh get there as far as uh traveling with them to look at different places we did do that and i would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up yeah yeah yeah i think think that's a great idea i mean that some people don't do it and then they get there and hate it or or whatever so right it's it it seems expensive at the time you're doing it but but the compared to the the total decision it's nothing if it's possible right i think in the short run it is expensive in the long run it's very uh reasonable if the person my daughter that's been in in Missouri uh for a yeah a second year now she's coming home at the end of the semester um-hum um-hum so uh you know she's already twenty one she started late so that's you know strictly up to her and uh she'll finish down here um um finish this year down here and then decide what she's gonna do next year yeah it'll save me a lot of money because i'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition but again that's her decision yeah right so uh but i have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back and they're much better students at twenty five twenty six maybe twenty eight so you know i don't i never have pushed them i just say that education is important you should do it uh but uh they have to do the work yeah so uh you know well back back to this visiting thing i mean i found that my kids had no conception of what college was really like um and and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand right yeah and being able to go with them to some at least some of them you know it had gave me a chance to explain things to them in terms uh in reference to what we had seen oh i think so and also i'm opposed to the to the size does they've just gotten so huge and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand see that's just too many good grief ended up going to where i used to go and that was twenty five hundred when i went there it's twenty one thousand now it's too big good grief what is what is twenty one thousand what what school is that so uh pardon it's Southwest Missouri State University uh-huh and um it was twenty five hundred when i went there forty years ago and uh my son is in a school about seven thousand and that's that's not bad i teach in a school about eight thousand and that's that's even a little large but it's much better than twenty one thousand um-hum yes but they do have to visit and and if if the parent can point out all the different places to look for for scholarships and then um-hum oh those rating uh the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything i don't think it hurts to look at them i don't put that much stock in them but probably fine just to compare yes um-hum helps helps to at least set up range of things to look at right and uh if they you know uh they need to  well what i believe is one of the major problems uh things that is wrong with our public school system is that um we do not have enough discipline and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be disciplined right now uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i agree with that uh when i went to school i know i was scared to death you were about being disciplined and the discipline that my daughter receives now in going to school it's just totally different uh-huh uh-huh you know you just you did not see i did not see anybody in my classrooms when i was going to school act up the way that kids do these days in the classroom yeah yeah yeah from what i understand they act up pretty bad yeah that's right that's right what uh grade is your daughter in my my daughter's in the um fourth grade and um there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum the classroom where the teacher cannot teach and when i went to school that just wasn't put up with yeah oh no huh-uh they always had paddle in our school uh-huh well they they they just don't do that anymore the the school system's afraid of getting sued and um i know um-hum all sorts of lawsuits i'm sure because of things like that and i also believe we don't yeah yeah even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system that the teachers are still underpaid and we still don't have enough money towards putting toward public schools um-hum um-hum um-hum and um i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more that maybe that can solve some of our problems yeah wasn't that what part of the lottery's gonna go for if we approve it uh-huh uh-huh yes supposedly that's what it's suppose to go for and you know we'll just have to wait and see whether that's proved or not you know i don't know your feelings toward that i guess we shouldn't get into that but um and what else um i think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire um-hum i have heard stories um from other parents that i know of when their children are in high school that teachers are out there giving drugs and selling drugs um-hum no really ooh oh yeah oh i've i've heard some horrible horrible stories about high school high school teachers and you know to be more be more careful of the teachers that we place in our schools um-hum um-hum hm um that's basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school systems i think with what they have to work with i think they're doing a pretty good job right now oh i do too i think they're doing real good job uh-huh so but then what do i know i don't have any kids no none at all you don't have any children in school you don't have any kids yeah okay so this is probably a real hard subject for you oh yeah so yeah okay well i guess um we can discontinue our call now it was a joy in talking with you okay well it's good talking to you too we'll see you bye-bye okay thanks bye-bye  Doug you want to start sure you don't use any credit cards i don't imagine no of course i use credit cards i have a couple of credit cards and yeah yeah and uh use them uh-huh do you use them a lot well we try not to we're on a pretty strict and tight budget we use the credit cards however uh-huh uh-huh when we're at a situation where we don't have either the cash or the checkbook handy um-hum or we use credit cards also if we want to get an extended warranty on on an item that we're purchasing so oh well that's an idea that's a thought um-hum so yes and basically we use it mainly when we're traveling or out of state or or somewhere where you know they don't take local they don't take out of state checks um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum and so when we're traveling some do you use credit cards often my husband loves them uh we do use them uh we try not to but he he's one who believes in credit cards and he uses them quite a bit uh-huh he likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month oh yeah well that's that's a good thing because lot of people don't pay at the end of the month and they just pay the minimum required balance he he likes doing that um-hum and that's when you get into expenses yes and you get in over your head it's right but it'll uh some people i know also try to use it as float uh-huh where they buy something now and say well i'm going to buy this when it's good and on sale and then i can go ahead and pay for it when i get my check at the end of the month when i'm being paid uh-huh right well sometimes you do come on bargains and that and it's really useful that's true and some places won't take you know like a personal check or cash even um-hum but they would take a credit card right how well how are the laws in Pennsylvania uh as as regard well not the laws but the rates credit card rates in Pennsylvania for example down here when you go to a gas station um-hum you get an extra charge for credit cards right than you would by paying for cash are they the same there we yeah we have the same thing up here so we don't deal where they do that we charge you know we go to places where they don't charge extra some of them charge five cents a gallon even like the gas stations more that's pretty steep and uh we just try to avoid you know the ones that do that we just don't uh go there yes because there's enough other ones around that don't charge you anything extra um-hum um-hum because actually to me credit cards are the same as cash to me they are anyways yes because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase and and so that the end of the month or when you get your credit card bill right right yeah are you saying that that way you're stranded not left stranded and high and dry very good you're you're one of the the good i guess good yes yes yeah right faithful shoppers that don't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money well i can't say we never have now we have you know at times made payments on our things but we try not to um-hum we try real hard well yeah well i see that as an advantage to a credit card also um-hum that you can um-hum can find yourselves in those situations and use a credit card to to help yourself so i think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations right right um-hum yeah because sometimes uh there's times when you may maybe couldn't take advantage of something um-hum but with a credit card you can um-hum um um-hum so um do you have uh multiple credit cards uh and do you find that advantageous or well i think we're narrowing it down actually uh uh like i said my husband likes them and we have quite a few but we really get when when you get down to the nitty gritty there's probably three that we use most of the time um-hum right we're we're actually in the same boat we like to use three uh um-hum basic credit cards that way we're not confused and we don't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes to the end of the month um-hum um-hum um-hum and do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail oh yes once a week twice a week or three times a week well it's not every week but but you do get them they make it very readily available um-hum yes almost too much so but i really i really don't like it the charges they you know we try to limit look look at that also what they charge per year right so the annual fee for to use our money you know they're charging us to spend our money and i i'm not real crazy about that so we try to look at that also right right yes so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card but um-hum plus they charge any where from seventeen to twenty three percent right uh based upon what the state will allow um  all right i've never done it before so i guess that's all i have to do right i've been called several times you know i push in pushed in my number i guess so they kept saying you have the invalid code and then i found out that my new phone wasn't working right so and this this so this the first time i've even done it oh really oh yeah i wonder how long it's gonna be on for i think five minutes is the max oh no i mean this whole thing like for two months or something do you know oh i don't know i'm not really sure yeah okay well back to crime i guess we're supposed to talk about that they say what aspect are you worried about well i think at this point i for one am worried about every aspect well especially uh you since you're in the same metroplex you know there's so much going on here i think the drive by shootings are getting so be so common that's really a something you got to protect yourself from you know well that and in the schools too um-hum God i know starting to put metal detectors in and have they done that in Garland no i not that i'm aware of no um i just heard you know last week at that one school they started putting them in because there was that one shooting right so um well we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the you know on the school grounds after school is that right and then one boy killed himself a few years ago in the in a grade school so you know these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood doesn't seem like uh-huh not at all yeah yeah so uh yeah it's kind of scary to think you send your child to school and you wonder if he's gonna get shot i mean we never had to worry about that before i know i know it's it's it's getting it's been out of hand i think for a while and it just continues to get worse what next right and you know we can't really depend on the police to solve all this they just can't do it yeah i think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent and and you know how we're gonna bring that back together right yeah that's yeah i think i agree i think that's where it stems from is that and um you know you've got a lot of a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children and that may impact it as well um-hum right and i think so and and then there's a drop in uh the training of morals really you know right right these some of these young kids you read about just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all i think yeah they don't think twice about it i think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals morals you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood yeah either that or i don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now or what the what the case is i think it was just rare i really do uh-huh my mother well she's like seventy four now or she when she was a young girl she had a beautiful beautiful cousin that lived in California um-hum and she was dating this millionaire's son and he wanted to marry her and she wouldn't marry him and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both you're kidding and um no i'm the witness himself and her yeah um that must've been at least fifty years ago or more but the point of the story is that that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was on all the papers all over the country for weeks i bet but now you know you would probably even read about it here in Texas oh i know it's just you know another killing well they were i was watching some show the other day and they were talking about uh mass murderers and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently and they were saying you know that um-hum um these guys want attention and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper it's on all the newspapers and TVs and and everything um-hum um-hum right and lots of their pictures and their life story and everything right and then you get to their life story oh they came from a broken family oh this person had mental problems oh duh duh duh you know um-hum right right i know how do we go into all these houses and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible i yeah so it that story i just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin well the same thing happened here in Arlington when was it i think it was oh it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with is that right yeah in fact it was on a Hard Copy she was a real attractive blonde girl in in her freshman year of college and some boy she tried to get rid of uh he was like in his twenties remember that yeah um-hum i remember seeing that i saw that on Hard Copy right right that's uh she my daughter graduated with her from Arlington High School yes is that right yeah can you believe it it's just uh i'm trying to remember he um had her in the car in front of Taco Bueno or something and he just shot them himself and her i remember seeing that on Hard Copy Taco Bueno right uh-huh um-hum right nobody yeah isn't that weird uh yeah there's just too many crazy people out there these days i know and uh the police are not gonna do anything until they've they have committed some sort of a crime i'm you know he was just begging her on the phone they can't do anything yeah and there are times i've think gee maybe i should give my kids guns  well what do you know about Latin American policies well i think they're kind of ambivalent really uh i i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations you know um-hum uh-huh we're we don't know half the time we don't know who to support are you uh relating this uh to the uh affair we've got going on in Haiti right now that and you know uh maybe it's maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with with uh countries like that that depend on us so much without you know just telling them running their country for them but right that that's just it it's got to be tough but i mean uh uh i'm you sure you still have to you know let them know how you feel right i guess my concern uh you know no matter which no matter which side we take we're gonna have supporters and we're gonna have uh antisupporters i guess for lack of better term and uh like you said they're such small countries that we're bound to upset somebody but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance yeah it it worries me that uh the economy of so many countries in in South America and Central America depend on something that that damages people like the you know like cocaine from Columbia and right right uh you know of course i i'm sure we have some enemies down there who would wouldn't care what happened to us but that's true but that is that's a tough deal and it i don't think that maybe i'm maybe it's you know i'm just reflecting how i feel about it but i have a feeling that we that we really don't understand basically the the the competing factions in a lot of those countries and i mean they've been hammering tongs for the last you know ten centuries sure and it's still going on and uh we we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us i think sometimes that that's about the lump sum of it well um i was speaking with a a woman from uh uh i believe she was from the Honduras or Guatemala or somewhere in there no she was from El Salvador yeah and uh she was from a relatively wealthy family and when uh the Contras came into power of course with uh oh gosh darn it what's his face he's in in Florida jail now Marcos yeah yeah uh no he's Marcos is Philippines yeah um well i'm blank i can see his face i mean how could you forget his face well you know who i'm talking about yeah i i know it uh anyway when he came into power he basically just took everybody's property you know just assigned it to himself yeah kind of nationalized it right right and uh for himself so she's been a real strong supporter of the Sandinistas and has been trying to back the US government in that respect and i in that respect i have to agree that i think we're taking the right stance uh because they were a democracy yeah turned uh dictator yeah you know right basically a dictator fascist and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing it just sure you know unstable well what do you think of uh this uh US free trade agreement we're working on with Mexico well i think it's long overdue uh i just you know there's so much difference in in the economies of the two countries i i'm not you know i have a problem uh um-hum with whether it's gonna work or not you know there's uh it seems like there's and i this may be unfair to Mexico but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in in in in foreign policy a lot of the times um-hum uh Mexico they're i i know they're trying they're really trying the Mexican government is trying and a lot of the larger Mexican businesses are trying to oh make themselves Americanized i guess yeah and uh which is great because that's what they basically need to do the big problem with the United States is we have our basic nine to five schedule you know and we don't have the Siesta and there's the cultural differences is what yeah yeah is what's kind of it's what's really hurting uh the Mexican the Mexican people because they've had their way of life and we've had our way of life and uh i think there's their version of the good old boy network going that uh you know has a lot  yeah i had this topic uh the last time i called i believe my goodness that's unusual well do you have any uh children or are you in college mine uh well mine are grown and uh of course uh i've already been through this with them i see well and i guess i'll have to help with grandchildren one of these days i hope certainly and where did your uh children go to college well one went to A and M and one went to um uh oh Stephen F Austin and one went to North Texas and one went to University of Texas at Dallas well that's great and one of them ended up at El Centro in one of the uh specialized programs and another is putting herself through right now back at UTD i see well that's great i'm the director of admissions at UTD oh well good well i'm glad you let her in well what advice did you give them when they were choosing their colleges it looks like they uh you have a variety there well the main thing was uh what is it you want to study and uh where is the best place to get what you need and well how far is it from home i had to put in and and then course we also had to include how much is it gonna cost well you're going right down my list uh the first thing that i always talk to students about is the academic program because if we don't have what you're looking for it isn't gonna do you any good no matter how bad you wanna come here yeah that's true that's true and uh cost is always uh usually next on the list especially for the parents and uh financial assistance and scholarships um-hum and usually then we talk a little bit about uh the size of the school and uh different types of organizations and activities that they can get involved in and of course distance from home and size of classes and um-hum um it sounds like uh from your experience you know how to go right down the list with them well you have to be practical because uh i know um our our first daughter went uh to Stephen F Austin and uh her allergies acted up in the Piney Woods and it was too far from home and she got lonesome and that didn't work out for her so i guess i learned on that one yeah you you know it's interesting especially when uh uh my experience uh has always been at a public university and uh a lot of the students in that home town uh sometimes shun the idea of staying and going to school across the street so to speak um-hum but uh it always seems like at the beginning of the year they're talking about well i'm going to this state and i'm getting out of here and i'm going way over there um-hum um-hum and a lot of times when it gets right down to the practical aspect of it they end up staying pretty darn close to home because they can save money as far as housing and uh laundry um-hum laundry and food i think food has a lot to do with it too you bet it sure does and mother doing the laundry especially with the boys the girls it don't seem the laundry isn't that quite that important because they seem to know how to handle that better but the boys it's that laundry that throws them there for a while sure even when they know how to use the washing machine well there's a little barrier around the washing machine and the dryer and uh for some reason men just can't get around that barrier oh well we'll have to give them the pass key i guess do you have uh uh more than the one daughter to plan for uh i have a daughter that's a seventh grader and then i have a son that's a sophomore at uh Shepton High School okay and so it's uh it's been interesting watching them uh sign up for appropriate course work and things and they're they're on the college bound track at least um-hum well that's good do you find that uh the boy is going in a different direction than the girl as far as what his uh um needs are and the type of college he wants well uh they certainly have two different personalities but uh in terms of needs the older son is interested in the medical field well yeah good and uh at this particular point you know taking appropriate course work but really nothing uh that's in out of the ordinary um-hum and uh the daughter has indicated that uh she wants to get a degree in uh business um and then go on to become President sure you bet and um-hum okay i'll vote for her if she has good track record hope i'm around to do so well i uh you know we're we we try to be conscious of uh of the uh equal uh equal rights and uh  okay Vic our topic is budgets yes do you keep a monthly budget uh i talk about doing that a lot welcome to the club uh i i use a uh computer software program to keep track of all expenses primarily it's a checking uh-huh you know a check balancing program but it does categorize categorize everything oh how interesting and and it allows you to either to go in and create a budget and then compare against it or actually will sort of generate one based on you know how you categorize things over the over the months oh so i have all the information there um it's just that i haven't been very diligent at at really tracking it and following it well uh it's just like the money it's hard to keep track of it as it goes out right right what do you do uh i'm a teacher and we're at a my husband and i are at a stage in life where we've got one left in college okay um-hum so budgeting is not our priority since we have one in college their expenses run beyond any budgeting allowances right okay okay we've quit um well the biggest problem that i've had or one of the one of the problems is um keeping track of cash expenditures you know expenditures yeah uh i think that one of the things that's uh makes budgeting very hard is the convenience of automatic teller machines uh the ability to go up and get cash so easily okay i see i stopped those four years ago yeah really okay well see you have control yeah oh yeah now we are you know um well we're at a point in life that we're looking to retirement rather than you know earnings um-hum so it's gotten to the point where um yeah automatic automatic teller i only had the card and it was on my own personal account and it got way out of control very fast okay huh so i have a tendency now i take an allowance and when it's gone it's gone you know i'm finished if it's gone the fifteenth of the month then it's gone well that's pretty good uh-huh it's gone huh oh that's great and uh we have a tendency not to use cash we pay everything by check right yeah that's a good way to do it and so that way we we keep control of what we're spending where it's going what it's going for um-hum well that's great so um you know it i take a hundred dollars a month that's all i take and you know i mean i don't buy groceries out of it it's my own little oh wow slush fund if you wanna call it that and that's for my little incidentals or running to the grocery store to get a you know gallon of milk or whatever um-hum yeah right but um after that it's check only right so we can you know really know where our money's going and you know what's happening um-hum what about how are you on charge cards uh pretty good about that that the last few years anyway we did have a Master Card that got out of hand for awhile but we just just stopped using it didn't get rid of it good there are times uh such as oh some mail order type things uh where it's very convenient to have yes uh but that's really the only thing it it's used for and uh one one problem i do have is with uh is it i in my job i travel a good bit and have to use my own uh credit card i don't have a business credit card okay so i use that and then have to file expense reports and uh it just adds another complication to properly tracking expenses knowing how much of it is reimbursed business expense uh or how much is my own expense for well yeah i i use uh credit cards not for credit but just for convenience in other words i pay we pay monthly the balance due uh but we do okay yeah well this might help you because see my husband travels as well uh-huh and we have separate charge accounts okay he's got an American Express and that's only traveling okay then we both have a Visa or MasterCard okay so anything on his American Express is his that's a pretty good way to do it and it's his expense now he gave me one and if i go with him on work um-hum um-hum i only charge on that card i don't put it on my MasterCard okay right so we've separated those two completely and i know what you mean because at first we used to intermingle our funds and we weren't sure why our bills were outrageous um-hum oh yeah it's hard to be sure to be sure right you know because his traveling expenses were you know i mean he's a traveling salesman so we're looking at six five oh boy  okay uh what what is it what does camping mean to you and and what camping have you done oh we've done a lot of camping actually that's one of our favorite pastimes um to us camping is is a combination of tent camping as well as environmental camping hm um and i think that really what it means to me is being outdoors in a sort of a wilderness environment and being able to enjoy nature what does it mean to you well what uh uh what what do you mean by environmental camping um there are a number of environmental cabins near where we live that uh offer some sort of dwelling some sort of um security from the elements but there's no electricity no heat no water oh okay but yeah that's neat i'm not not not had that available uh anywhere that i've lived at well uh first oh yeah State Park System i think is probably what supports a lot of those they're they're state as opposed to county facilities what what state is that California California okay i'm in Texas and uh uh oh but most of the camping that we've done we we spent uh ten years in New England uh and my wife and i did a lot of tent camping before uh our first oh uh-huh uh boy was born uh there in in uh state parks in uh New England and uh uh-huh uh-huh here here in Texas there are are state parks where they have uh uh what shelters they're called uh they're wood frame on a concrete slab but screened in uh-huh kinds of of shelters and uh but they have uh electricity and uh water at those cabins and there there's cabins i see actually in the cabins so it's like uh a a sink well that's the no the uh there's uh one outlet and a light in the cabin uh an overhead one overhead bulb and then just outside the cabin there's a uh faucet uh coming up out of the pipe coming up out of the ground so that there's access to water like that uh um-hum um-hum in in Texas what are the camp parks like if you go tent camping are you near a real wooded area or does it tend to be more um plains well uh no it's it's the the ones that i'm familiar with are are basically uh basically wooded areas uh Texas has an awful lot of uh man made lakes uh-huh and uh uh tend to be uh wooded areas around those lakes i'm in i'm in Dallas northeast uh um-hum uh-huh what a difference from New England though i bet yes yes oh yeah yes yes there there you could uh you know depending on what kind of camping you wanted why uh you go an hour in a different direction here you go three hours in any direction and it's still about the same so uh that's a difference but we also uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well what's it like camping with your son when he was young well well we didn't we took a break from camping uh for with the the uh boys until they uh they got into uh scouts basically and uh and then our biggest one we we rented a uh pop up tent trailer uh-huh uh several years ago and went up to uh the Black Hills and back down through the uh uh Colorado uh Rocky Mountain National uh Park and uh oh wow that's a pretty area uh-huh Colorado Springs area and so forth Pikes Peak and that was a that was a lot of fun uh-huh i bet it was for them too it's been an experience uh with our daughter who's turning two in a couple of days because she was probably six months old the first time and we had kind of missed camping yeah oh okay well i the last time we'd camped before she was born i think i was eight months pregnant because we like stretched to the very end and that was a little rough in a tent but uh she's actually done very well and has enjoyed it a lot even even as a little uh-huh yeah yeah little kid so it's been kind of fun uh trying to adjust our routine and and doing it with with her as she grows up yeah yeah and i'm sure it'll be a lot different when she has a chance to really participate more right right at at at at at two she's old enough to walk but not too far i would guess and and which is what your kids have done right and she's fairly cautious so we're not too concerned about her running into the poison ivy or whatever yeah well right right but you also don't do a lot of of hiking associated with the camping i i presume yeah yeah well that that sounds good sounds good exactly uh staying close to the camp ground and uh well it sounds like you've um continued it no matter where you've been and how your family's grown so that's my aspiration as well yeah yeah and uh uh and and uh although it it after a while it gets uh with teenage boys at this point well one's uh in college but uh uh oh wow cool uh it it turns different in that uh the problem becomes one of getting getting time when they're available and don't have other activities uh right right well i guess it  tell me what you like to do well i i collect antique tools uh for one thing i well i'm sort of in a an antique business but it's it's a little sideline part time thing oh uh-huh wonderful and uh i'm building a a log house at a farm that i have in East Texas which you like a a a hundred miles from here ah wonderful yeah it's really neat and i i been course i've been working on it for five years but you know oh but how wonderful how are you close to getting it done yeah yeah it's getting real close to you know uh of course there's still a lot of work to be done and then when you get it completely you you know the shell finished uh you still have a lot of stuff to do inside oh but uh are you gonna move your whole family over there then no actually uh i'm i'm not even sure i may i'll probably always have a place here in Richardson or Dallas uh-huh kind of your getaway place yeah escape but it's beautiful it a you know it's eastern hardwood um forest there are a lot of pine trees but it's mostly oaks and ah oh how beautiful and it's pretty flat there well it's it's kind of hilly but it's you know low hills it's not uh see i've only been to Texas once i have two sisters in Texas now um one in Austin one in Dallas and the one in Dallas is the one that got me to doing this yeah and um i thought Austin was beautiful i liked the hills and the trees yeah yeah in Austin it it's really different because that's kind of a you you know that's the chalk hills down there limestone limestone hills oh and you've always lived in Texas have you yeah except for time in service uh-huh born raised Texan huh well i had never been there that's that's pretty neat my sisters both seem to like it pretty well my brother-in-law works for the university um in Dallas yeah he's admissions director which at at which one uh University of Texas in Dallas yeah oh okay that's just north of me here yeah well that he's got a job there and this is his first year so it's been a real interesting thing for them that's great but they seem to like it okay i think they're too far away from me but well yeah maybe some day they can get closer we'll see that's a pretty good trip so what are you what kind of hobbies are you in well i'm a mother of four so basically i'm just real busy with my kids right now in sports and we have a little Halloween talent show tonight it's yeah i substitute at the schools part time oh that's great well i am a travel agent at heart and my hobby is just i love traveling and and being involved of that and finding out more uh but it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband so no kidding i reluctantly gave that career up and am just substituting at the school so i've been librarian all this week which has been real interesting and i'm enjoying it i'm around my kids and hey that's that's pretty easy substituting isn't it oh yeah yeah it's great it's great and what else do i do i do lots of cross stitching when i have time and i enter things in our little state fair and that's pretty fun ooh that's great well that actually my hobbies is mostly is my sports tennis i play tennis ooh i love tennis too and i ski ski do you ski ooh do you yes we snow ski we snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly in Oregon have you ever been there uh that's great i no uh wonderful place i've skied in Colorado and we usually usually go to New Mexico because it's a little cheaper you know but uh ooh uh-huh where in Colorado uh i've been to uh Telluride which is on the west side and uh Copper Copper is kind of my favorite up there Breckenridge uh yes yes really uh-huh and Keystone i guess those are the only places i've skied up there i would love i can hardly wait to get up there me too you guys are are you guys getting snow we it is snowing right now we're to get one to three inches tonight oh gee well it's awful i heard Aspen got three feet oh yeah well we're yeah we are on the dry side of the mountain Seattle is only about two and a half hours so of course i'm a real Seahawks fan and um going over that pass is just a real nightmare yeah i can imagine my lord and um so and we're on the colder side they're on the rainy side we're on the snowy side yeah and um we we ski my my children all ski and we we have been to Whistler in Canada which is just a marvelous place Whistler and Black Home oh super uh-huh is in Canada and then we've gone to Sun Valley several times that's a just a great place but no Colorado not in Colorado since i was in college because i went to school haven't been there i keep hearing these marvelous things about Deer Valley and um don't Adam um City what about Utah yeah i haven't either i always wanted to go to Canada to Canada to Banff or somewhere like that you know ooh yes and your kids all ski uh not all of them my my kids are all grown uh but my youngest son is a skier uh-huh uh-huh really that's great well my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death when they're skiing they're fearless and they go off uh-huh  hey Patty uh we're supposed to talk about uh child care okay my children are all grown huh i don't have any no and you don't have any well some day you will and then then you'll be real selective about choosing a child care right um-hum um-hum yeah i worked at a child care center for about a week well you know all about them then well tell me about it yeah well that was all i could take not so much the kids as the children but because of the director oh those you didn't like the director yeah hum-um but um i had about ten children in a class and i just know they take a lot of energy uh-huh oh boy i bet it did uh-huh my wife worked at a child care quite a few years ago and she liked it all right when her huh how long did she work there oh i think she worked there about two years our gosh she must be very patient two or three years well we had small children at the time see so so uh it worked out pretty good she'd be there with some of them and uh-huh broke her in oh great and uh it worked out real good it was a church school where we we went to church there and uh she worked there good hm hm but uh i have uh all my children are grown now and they have their children in day care one one of them keeps her child with a with a relative though hm hm and uh but the other one has used a day care for her children um-hum um-hum and uh nice when you have relatives that can do that yeah they they uh her her husband's sister and she needs the money and and plus she you know she's close and gives him good care and um-hum it's does she have kids too or and she has kids too and he's just a baby but he does enjoy though she has twins and they're two or three years older than him but they um-hum hm all spoil him you know and he key likes it watching them play and everything but uh hm um-hum well even with um two teachers in my class with ten kids it was still quite a handful oh gosh i'm sure it was i wouldn't you couldn't pay me to work in one you know you got to like you just got to you know not mind children that much so um-hum yep but uh because they try your patience you know not on purpose not on purpose but they just get into everything and yeah well of course that's just the way they are uh-huh running around and diaper changing yeah and when you don't have children of your own that's not a lot of fun is it well but you probably will some day reckon so um-hum right um yeah first i need to get married though first i need to get married uh-huh oh plenty huh well yeah but you got plenty of time to do that you sound pretty young but uh so i don't have a whole lot of experience with day care centers myself now either hm um-hum well this one was pretty good um was it in Dallas uh-huh North Dallas uh-huh uh-huh and since that the director was really really picky about kind of silly things you know nothing that really had to do with you know endangering the child or anything you know uh-huh uh-huh um like she didn't like the way i answered the phone or you know she didn't like this she didn't like that things that didn't have anything to do with the children so oh yeah uh-huh i thought it might have been something that the state required but that wouldn't um-hum no it just she had such high expectations about silly little things you know that wouldn't apply to that would it uh-huh that didn't make sense uh right so but i probably could've put up with you know the kids and all that but it yeah well and it those kind it probably didn't pay a whole lot either nope huh-uh nope so if it doesn't pay a whole lot it's hard to put up with a lot of right um-hum that Mickey Mouse stuff that's my other line but i no i'll just ignore it while you wanna grab it real quick or because it'll be recorded i guess yeah i'll just i'll just ignore it and if they want anything they'll in a little while okay hm and uh since we got so are you you said your kids have kids or yeah yeah i have four grandchildren uh-huh and they're happy with their day care centers or yeah well neither one of them have them in a day care center right now but uh um my my daughter that has has three sons she is a oh huh um-hum you still there aren't you um-hum um-hum i guess it was that thing hanging up uh she had him in one and was real happy with it and then got unhappy with it and then she moved him to another one and was just real happy with it it's in Garland uh-huh huh uh-huh so uh she had really i'd say she had pretty good experiences with them uh-huh oh oh yeah the one she the first one she quit they'd lost his medicine oh sent it home with another kid and it made her mad but i mean that's you know you got fifty kids there i could see that happening huh uh-huh um-hum yeah but you course you lose a fifty dollar bottle of medicine but it looks like somebody ooh you'd wanna be reimbursed at least well it looks like they would've whoever took it home would've brought it back yeah but anyway it made her real mad that's why she left it but other than that i mean it you know they'd been real good too so i'd i'd say she's had really you know real good experiences with them huh uh-huh that's good nothing no horror stories or you know of course they're regulated pretty strictly by the state um-hum um-hum yep and uh which is good yeah  ah so Beverly what do you think about drug testing i think in some professions it's uh essential things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly yeah we've we got a lot of mistakes here uh in no Maryland Baltimore area because of um train conductors uh on drugs i think we've had two terrible accidents here recently and also on um um-hum just like i bet you within five days a truck where the uh a dump truck where the driver was uh high on marijuana i guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and uh drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath the uh a river that leads into the Chesapeake Bay oh my goodness and it would that would tried up traffic for a long time everybody died the fire was terrible it was awful so i yeah i think you're right i i think i if if if it's if you're in a field but then you know who would test all truck drivers they that's that is a problem and every time before they get into a vehicle you know right yeah i think i think at looking at athletes being drug tested i mean um-hum i don't know even i think the random drug testing i don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs because they're still being caught does that make sense um right yes it may make a difference for some of them yeah and then uh i think because they don't want to lose that lucrative uh career yeah i i i think in the long run i think it's it would be good i think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know the the test hasn't come down hard on anyone i don't i don't know um-hum right um-hum however here in Dallas uh we had a a player Roy Tarpley on the Mavericks team yeah um-hum and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing and was to the point he is on probation it's to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract and they wouldn't have to pay him and the Mavericks wanted to get rid of him but they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract right and uh just recently he was uh missing from practice and whenever he missed like that usually he had some kind of problem and so a mandatory drug test was done was positive so they were able to get rid of him and not have to pay his contract um-hum yeah get rid of him right yeah but and so in his case he lost his whole career he's been in the paper in jail and it's just been awful and talk about a terrible role model yeah right i i think that that that's a terrible thing you know it's really funny though um i guess my dad was hit by a a drunk driver who was also high um when i was probably eighteen my senior year in high school um oh my goodness and um though he's alive today and everything worked out fine it it it happened about two blocks from the high school and a friend came and got me and i was there and i could smell the dope and i could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him um-hum and nothing ever happened and from from that point on i became so anti-drunk driving you know now i think people should be allowed to drink i think that's an adult responsibility whatever oh that's terrible um-hum but i really uh i'm so anti-drunk driving and and drugs have uh long lasting effects and i i guess when i younger i was um probably a little more liberal on the subject um-hum i think most of us are yeah and but as i've as as as soon as that happened i guess when i was eighteen years old if you'd have asked me i'd have thought it was fine but it by the time i was nineteen my opinion had totally changed yeah um-hum yes if you know someone for example we have uh some friends whose son was driving home from work was hit head on by a drunk driver the drunk and his wife in the car were killed um-hum and uh Bobby missed his whole junior year of high school right he went through surgery after surgery and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again and he as far as his athletics athletics he's lost all of that hm traction and all that terrible stuff right he uh has been tutored and he'll catch up in school and everything but he's still not back where he was he may never have all those motor skills back right yeah i don't think somebody yeah you don't you don't you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life i can't even say you know i wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life you don't have the right to interfere in somebody's life no another thing that we saw here recently one of some of our high school kids were out goofing around in a park area that a a train track ran through um-hum and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train well he missed the train missed him but uh a big mirror type thing sticking out like a metal thing sticking out hit him in the head yeah he was in a coma for four months he's out of the coma now and eventually they think he will come back um-hum but you don't know that and but he's lost he was an outstanding football player right  okay what uh what do you mean by camping uh well i work i work out at Scarborough Fair down Waxahachie and i'd i'd camp out there during the uh the the open season that we're open down there so i've got my tent and my all that stuff going and uh-huh um-hum tent sleeping bag and i i just leave it all down there over the weekend or during the week while i'm gone and and come back and crawl in and everything's uh-huh right where i left it i don't have to set it up once a week or anything like that but it's a lot easier right uh-huh so like camping to you means tent camping and sleeping bag and to some people camping's going out you know in a motor home yeah that's that's that's those the the the wimps way out to rough it but uh oh no camping camping to me is you you know like the question said there's different types of camping and going out in a tent and not being around any sort of facilities shower facilities or bathroom facilities and yeah yeah uh i don't like to get that extreme i don't i don't really particularly care for that you know i don't mind staying in tents with sleeping bags and everything but i like you know a bathroom near or shower near yeah yeah that's that's what's nice about working out at Scarborough and the uh the participants have a uh a a separate shower thing that we all are go use and everything so don't have to bother with Port-a-Pots or anything like that um-hum right you know when when i was younger i would go up into Colorado and you know and we'd go up and we'd hike up into the mountains and camp with tents you know and we wouldn't have anything and now that i've gotten a little older yeah a little like some of the finer things in life yeah i i was in Boy Scouts when i was a kid and so i i've done dealt with all that fun stuff right like right i don't like to go camping now and stay in a tent without one of the big thick air mattresses to sleep on because ground's a little bit yeah i i i i keep a uh one of those uh those banana lounge chairs that have the two parts that fold on it um-hum right i unfold one of those and throw my sleeping bag on it and if i have to crawl in i crawl in if not i just lay on top of it you know depending on how cold it is whatever and i i i never touch the floor um-hum right i i've tried those too only part of those is that that they're really not wide enough for your arms to have any place to hang down you know yeah yeah uh i can get comfortable anywhere but uh yeah so some people like to use the uh the the Coleman uh cook stoves and stuff no uh uh real fire real fire got to have a fire pit um-hum right no yeah i i don't either you know some people even bring charcoal with them and um yeah charcoal charcoal is nice if the ground is sopping wet otherwise grab a dead tree yeah yeah that's that's what i like to use and they just kind of look at me and go well why are you gonna go to that trouble we have this Coleman stove here because i want i want my food to taste like i just cooked it over a you know a fire pit not over i just look at them and go uh-huh propane that's like the people that bring instant coffee with them too and heat up their water and i go what's wrong with the coffee pot you yeah what's wrong with the good old coffee pot throw the grounds in heat the water up yeah that's right well i enjoyed talking with you okay thank you thank you bye-bye  not be a very good conversationalist on fishing i don't do a lot of it well i do love to fish well good maybe i can learn something well i don't know how much you can learn i'm not so sure i'm good at it but i do enjoy doing it yeah do you well it is fun what little i do of course i don't you know i think when they refer to different kinds of fishing i told my husband last night when i called and they had told me that this was a topic i said well i can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm he said i don't think that's the different kinds of fishing they're talking about well i hope it is there's not a whole lot of different kinds that's about the only kind i know how to do i don't do a lot of deep sea fishing i because i get seasick but we have a lot of lakes here in this area um-hum uh-huh and i do a lot of fishing for um bass we have a lot of uh uh couple of lakes in our area that are filled just filled with good sized bass um-hum and then when i get tired of them outwitting me i fish for catfish um-hum and we use worms worms and shiners which is pretty much like minnows a little bit bigger than minnows and then i also use spinner baits and plastic worms um-hum um-hum it all depends on what i'm fishing for and the time of day well it sounds like you do quite a bit of it i do uh there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here and um-hum it's very convenient on afternoons when i wanna just get away and sit and think fishing's a good way to do that and i have a lot of friends who like to go fishing um do you have a boat no i don't i have a friend who has a little inflatable inflatable raft and we use that sometimes um-hum um-hum i wish i had a boat but i don't i think the lakes are probably different in Michigan than they are in Texas the ones around here are so big that you can fish off the dock um-hum but unless you have a boat you can't really get into the where they call the good fishing holes you know right that's the same way here isn't it you have to get back in the sticks in the is it uh-huh my in-laws live on a lake uh a little bit east of Dallas kind of in the Piney Woods and the lake is beautiful and i like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish but actually catching fish to eat per se you don't really do much of that right there i catch a lot of little old uh i think they call them perch right and then the the uh turtles try to eat up all my bait so it's it's so close to the dock that i think all i do is feed them a little bit but it's kind of fun oh we we don't have we don't have a big problem with turtles but we do have a lot awful lot of snakes in our lakes um and i i would be afraid of that well i can't think of a time that i've been fishing that i haven't run into one or two of them do they ever get on your hook no we uh occasionally i'll catch an eel on an on a hook but uh-huh never the snakes they just kind of are they poisonous snakes uh we have a lot of cottonmouth and so yes they are definitely uh-huh and they live in the shallow little coves that i like to fish in so i see them swimming by every once in a while um yeah i think i'd be a little bit afraid of those yeah they can they're they're certainly ugly um-hum we uh saw a large snake right off the dock there at my in-laws place last year it was probably four inches in diameter or something something like that you know great big snake and it course it scared the women to death you know but the men come out and said oh well that's only a a king snake it won't really hurt you you know but it looked so bad and it was so big that it it might not would have hurt us but we sure felt like it was hurting us just being there you know but they're scary looking yeah definitely do you have bass yes uh i think that uh probably around here people fish for bass and crappie and catfish more than anything else right well that's pretty much the same way here i um-hum now they have a lot of bass tournaments well we have those i don't do i inevitably if i enter one of those i never catch a thing i just go out there and sit and watch other people do it um-hum oh no um-hum well that's kind of we've never entered a tournament or anything we're not that big into fishing but i see a lot of people you know early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out and they'll say well there's a big bass tournament this weekend and all those people are here for the tournament you know and oh yes so i think there's a lot of people that have you know really i guess that you'd call it really sport fishing they're really into it to try to win yeah oh definitely my certainly here they are but it is it's very a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out in on the water and looking around the peace and calmness is really relaxing yeah it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and to fish um-hum now i've never tried taking a book with me i'll have to try that one of these days that's what i do a lot yeah  well let me just start by asking what you think of this Middle East affair we've got going on i think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the Middle East i have to agree with you there i uh i think that uh for once we should we shouldn't even be at at these Mideast talks because with the exception of our hostages we really don't have to much of a uh a real interest we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding who's land it is just let these people fight it out i agree you know we've got so many domestic problems and and what does it cost to keep these people over there you know absolutely oh so how about the uh the Soviet Union what do you think's gonna happen there the break ups i think that's great i'm i'm glad to see that but i again i don't want to see us pour a whole lot of economic aid into the Soviet Union without a uh well uh not a whole lot under any circumstances because i i don't know i'm a i'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them and so i'm i'm not much in favor of it but i'm glad to see us advising them that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money so um-hum that's right that's right but i'm ready to have a uh President elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda even if it doesn't work at least he is somebody who who is working on that problem and i i haven't seen that in the last eleven years so they don't seem to have a clue well let's see Reagan obviously wasn't too concerned with the domestic side of of of uh his political affairs uh and i think Bush's kind of followed suit um international is important but i mean we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed uh you know and then there's the homeless issue and and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without uh hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations i think and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending oh i agree i just i i think we got once we started economic aid over seas we have really set ourselves up to be sort of the the world bank and as far as aid is concerned and i think there's a a limit and we've passed it a long time ago right i agree we've been writing off way too many bad debts uh country bad debts yeah that's another thing i don't understand is is is things like selling technology and uh even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt exactly that doesn't to me that just doesn't make any sense as as much in debt as we are i know it i just i i don't know i think it's definitely time for a change but i don't see anybody i don't understand too why we have to have Democrats and Republicans and it's it's either one way or the other there's right it seems seems to be we're turning into a black and white society you either do it this way or you do it that way and there's no in between that's right you're either liberal or you're conservative and that just uh it obviously isn't working well i think uh it it wouldn't hurt and i know the Independent Party's been trying for years to get a a a real force in in the uh in Congress but uh you're right there's just too many issues that come up that uh our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a Democratic issue or it's a Republican issue and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel oh yeah i think uh we might have a a lot better a lot more efficient running government and and a lot better laws passed oh i agree with you well of course you know we have the national embarrassment in our state Jessie Helms and uh as soon as as we can get of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth he he just lines up people against him so it's not too it's not too often that you see him swaying too many opinions he's uh usually on the the ninety eight to two side he's the one of the two that votes he's one he's one of the two huh yeah he's very ineffective i think well let's see uh Senators are in for six years right and uh when did you guys vote him into office right oh unfortunately nineteen ninety oh you're stuck yeah we're stuck with him for a a little while longer but uh unfortunately for him but maybe fortunately for us his health is not great so i i hate  uh you keep up with current events um somewhat yeah not not as well as i would like to probably but that's the way it goes somewhat is that right yeah where where abouts in Pennsylvania what where in Pennsylvania um State College i go to Penn State oh do you well great yep how's uh well no we're not supposed to talk about that we're supposed to talk about current events well i'm a current event junkie so i right exactly uh i watch i try to watch the news and i read the newspaper and i like to read Time magazine People magazine keep up what's going on in the world i see well what particularly are you interested in but well i just pretty uh a little you know about everything and not and then again not everything but you know i like to know um-hum pretty well what's happening so political things don't interest me a great deal except i do like to stay informed enough to feel like i halfway vote intelligently you know um-hum but uh other than that uh i just you know just the events that happen around the world interest me and yeah and stay in touch with it know feel like i know what's going on now i have to say all three of my children none of them are too interested in current events i see but i always have been um-hum and i stay up with it but uh how do you how do you uh stay aware of most of the current events uh newspaper um uh well some of both i TV news or what um-hum read i read the newspapers sometimes and i watch CNN and that sort of thing occasionally and i uh-huh well that's yeah that's good because read magazines and such uh-huh well you stay up with it pretty well then well yeah i mean not not that badly anyway so i am i am interested in what's going on uh-huh yeah uh-huh and i'm particularly interested in certain things of course like all the news about Haiti recently because i've been down there uh-huh yes uh-huh oh you've been there well you would be interested in it then and yeah right exactly yeah uh i i follow it you know i don't just read everything about but i i'm always aware of what's going on like that yep and uh because it is it's interesting um-hum and uh i i don't know i feel sorry for those people down there they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many many years you know i mean through Papa Doc i mean he was a terrible tyrant that's true they've never really had a good leader uh-huh um-hum and it i think it's been better since he died but it's still been bad yeah but uh even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew uh i i've read some things about him that he was he wasn't too good himself oh yeah yeah he was pretty pretty much a he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things you know um-hum but uh i see that's one one of the reasons US wasn't so you know didn't do more than they did at the time um-hum because they weren't all that excited about him although he's probably better than a lot of them but uh but then again who know you know they're so super so used to it i guess it's the only thing that works yeah so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America and and not that i think it's pretty darned good i think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have um-hum i really do now i uh they sometimes they jump on it and and and go a little to the extreme the media does but uh but that's kind of understandable because you know it of course if you watch it more than more than once a day i mean it's the same thing over and over and over and over and i listen to the radio watch right so i you hear it so much you get a little tired of it but then again so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day maybe yep but i think the quality of our uh our news is just uh i don't believe it could be better um-hum yeah well you know i think it probably could be it always could be better but i'd agree that it's pretty good i really don't i don't think so i don't think our news could be better oh yeah i i mean i mean what else could they do to make it better um i don't see anything that they could do yeah it well i think that um i don't know well you always wanna think everything can be improved upon i i really i understand what you're saying the uh right right i think that but by trial and error over the years i think they got it about as good as they gonna get it well that may be so yeah uh i think that i'm not always satisfied with how dig they deep into things how deep they dig into the things and such uh nothing is perfect but yeah uh-huh well that's uh that's true i understand what you're saying and then again i understand why they can't dig too much deeper that's why we have CNN you know CNN has the time since that's all they do is news to dig deeper right um-hum right  okay you want to tell me first how you feel about well um i i just think the way that things are going that um that it would be good for young people to go ahead and have um dedicate themselves to at least something the proposal uh-huh i know like the Mormon religion you know they require two years of service uh missionary service uh right the boys the boys not the girl just the boys yeah and um so but i think it would be good if for all young people you know to be able to to do something like that um so that um you know uh-huh um-hum i i i don't know i just feel it would be good for them to do that um-hum i i thought it would be good too but i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the Peace Corps yeah because not all young people would have uh what it takes to go like that um-hum because i think it takes a certain person to to be able to do something like that but there's a lot of other public service things that could be done oh sure oh yeah and and even in even in our home towns there's a lot of um public service things that they could do um-hum right uh you know drug rehabilitation and and alcohol and and just uh helping old people and um right uh you know helping cripple just helping somebody else and i think that art of giving is something that um we don't have very much any more yes yeah uh-huh yeah i think it would be when they say this proposal is this something that they're just suggesting or are they actually why why why did they call it a proposal that oh i i think they just gave it a title but it's it's not something that's um in legislation or in works um uh yeah no no it's not it's just a just a topic but uh-huh uh-huh that's what i wondered what it'd be a good character builder i i think so too i think so too um because there's so many um kids who have uh you know so much money and so much free time and uh nothing to do um and and nothing to give their time to huh um-hum um-hum um they don't even have a direction to give their their time to so i think it would be really good for people to um to be able to give their time in in uh some kind of public service uh even in our government right you know as uh aids to uh you know Congress uh people um-hum so um yeah it would be uh it'd be really good i think um-hum well people that are um have received sentences in jail they have uh some of them are going out and doing uh they have to go out and do public service activities which to me is is good uh-huh right oh yeah oh yeah i agree with you yeah this is something that um like you say it's it's character building um you know learning how to to give to others and being less selfish and um um-hum um-hum well i think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like you know what what some of the other parts of the world are like or even other parts of the neighborhood uh um-hum right um-hum um-hum yeah some of the people how they live or oh i agree with you i agree with you and and i think uh young people are so um uh focused just on themselves and their activities and whose going out with whom et cetera that uh you know um-hum um-hum you know to get a taste of what the real world is actually about uh you know doing that that public service would be great yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah because that's one thing that's hard with young people you you can't tell them how things are they have to see for themselves and right um-hum now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years i don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done oh yeah i would think so like right after um high school you know even even if it was like the the the their um that summer right after high school you know three months uh-huh um-hum of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction um-hum you know they their teenage years and that they really sometimes need a little better direction to go uh-huh uh-huh and something course now Peace Corps that couldn't be done of course until they were done with school right right in such you know something that was that was outside of uh outside of school um-hum yeah but yeah you know right right after you graduate from uh high school because a lot of people are just um uh well gee whiz what do i do now if if they're not focused on going to college and uh you know having that that uh gung ho plan uh that's you know setting their life goals um-hum um-hum um-hum kind of an in between time um-hum um-hum yeah so to me see that would be the the uh the greatest time for um you know uh teenagers to to do that would be right after they graduated from high school yeah um-hum but as for it being required you know we're we're just not we're not based on on on that uh type of a system um yeah huh-uh no and and like i said not now all young people should be able to do something but um-hum not all certainly would be geared to even the the Mormon boys that go out not all of them go i mean it's disaster if they don't go but but some of them are not they're just not made to do that type of thing right oh right uh-huh uh-huh and they just aren't able to do it yeah yeah so um yeah it'd be good but like i said it requiring it would be uh but  uh did you hear i guess you heard the subject right uh right magazines right well i tell you i'm about a magazine junkie so this is right up my alley oh good okay well go ahead and start and pick one okay well see i subscribe to Consumer Report Texas Monthly D Time my husband's now getting Hotrod and then i pick up Money magazine and then a couple of women's you know if when i stroll through the supermarket and uh i don't know i just love magazines for some reason yes i even like People magazine but i hate to buy it because you can read it in twenty minutes and then you feel like you wasted your money you know oh well let's see i subscribe to Bon Appetite uh Vogue Bazaar and um a home decorating magazine that's all i can think of oh i bet your house looks nice and mine is decorated the way it was seventeen years ago oh i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm not a woman's woman by the looks of this house i need to get a woman's woman in here to help me out but i do like to cook or i used to seems like you know the busier you get the that kind of lose you lose out on that some it is it's difficult well let's see you you have one in particular that oh i subscribed to at one time and haven't for some time but i think is really interesting is Consumer Reports right yeah we do subscribe to that it is interesting and you really get some surprises in there too and if if you would read it religiously you would save a lot of money do you go ahead well do you actually act on any of the uh tips that they give you oh yes i i we really do uh go out and look for some of the brands you know and then then we'll lose the copies or some'll get thrown away and we'll get sloppy you know yes but uh uh many many times we have acted on it yeah because sometimes the cheaper brand is is better than a leading one you know it's one i probably ought to resubscribe to you know particularly if you're getting ready to buy some kind of a major product right but it's interesting even with the everyday you know like the shampoos and all um they had one i recall not too many years ago that they were talking about the various brands of shampoos and how uh um-hum oh yeah i remember that yeah and the most expensive ones were not the ones that they recommended i know they've done that before on uh mascara and different kinds of makeup too well you know i was at a a wedding reception once and there was a girl there that was a chemist for one of the oh who is that uh famous makeup Mary Kay i think it was uh-huh and she said well the truth of the matter was there was just only a handful of basic products you could make cosmetics out of anyway so they were nearly all pretty similar i kind of have heard that too but you know how much do you want to pay uh for the brand to feel glamorous or whatever uh-huh exactly right for the packaging so uh and that always stood out in my mind and i really buy a lot of cheap uh lipsticks and i think they're just as pretty and they last as long as the real expensive ones well i only do Maybelline mascara because i think it's the best i guess they're gonna kill us if we talk about our cosmetics instead of magazines but right yeah that's what i have oh that's right i forgot i wonder who has to listen to all this garbage i don't know it's got to be a boring job i know this is only my second call i just kept forgetting about it and then my phone wasn't working and i'd get a call every now and then and i'd put my PIN number in and they'd say this is incorrect then then somebody suggested it was the phone sure enough we had a new phone and so now i had to switch phones so i'm just trying to make some calls and catch up how many have you made ah i was in the project oh maybe six or eight months ago ah and then oh i made maybe five six seven and then they had some problems on the system and i just kind of got out of it and this is the first one since they brought it back up again that i have done um-hum um-hum right uh but um from what i understand they get people from all over the country but i i yeah my daughter was on it last time well we didn't know it was only supposed to be my husband so anytime anybody called we punched in number and talked well that got to and she talked to somebody several times from Virginia oh i've never gotten anyone outside the Dallas area well me either i i was uh in fact i haven't gotten anyone over here i'm in Arlington i usually get Garland or Mesquite or Dallas but it's kind of interesting isn't it yeah yes it is i know i wonder if it's really gonna help them well it helps us with our five dollars a call oh i know did you get a present or money last time yes we we got a what what was it my husband works for TI so we couldn't get the money we had to choose something but it was neat we got a camera and he got a real nice attache case which he needed anyway well that's fun right do y'all work for TI or you just heard about it no just a friend of mine ah introduced me to it um-hum but uh okay i'm gonna get us back on magazines so we can okay now i'm gonna ask you your opinion of the the perfume tear strip in magazines when you get those oh right right well i like them i've heard people are allergic to them or something i do too i think they're great well if you do nothing else with them i tear them out of the books and put them in my lingerie drawers or something i just read about that in the paper the other day and uh i need to do that that's a great idea no i like them a lot and uh i've bought you know sure  well Robin um i do have a PC in my home uh-huh um-hum i don't have at home but i used one at work and i play on there but i do i do some of my own stuff on there too so use one at work yeah what do you use it for as far as your own work um oh games mostly um data base like address lists and recipes and just um-hum uh sort of the stuff that i like to keep track of mostly most of what i do is shareware games and and copies of stuff that i've gotten from other people i use Lotus a lot just because i like using Lotus yeah yeah do your kids ever get to use it at work uh no because they're two and four so they're not quite old enough to use those yet i tell them mommy's playing on the computer so two and four huh yeah not there yet yeah they know what i'm doing yeah well but at work i use it mostly for i most of what i do is in Lotus i've we've got a couple of word processing but i'd rather use Lotus i know it better yeah know it better than that yeah i think everyone knows it better than most the custom word processor uh yeah uh well we've got WordStar 2000 we just got WordPerfect and i haven't gotten around to learning WordPerfect yet so yeah well i use WordPerfect at work exclusively pretty much exclusively yeah it's i like well i work for the RTC so we that's what everything they send us is in WordPerfect so we kind of had to get WordPerfect so uh have to use it yeah well i have one at home that my kids are twelve eight and three oh so they use it uh quite a bit for games and uh the twelve year old uses it you know for school uses the word word processing for school quite a bit really i'll bet uh-huh well good yeah that's that's one thing i'm hoping by the time mine get up there that we will be able to have one at home and and uh yeah now we also uh course of i use it for uh i have a some check balancing and budgeting software that i use have for several years now every all my checkbook's been on the computer for a couple years uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah that's since i work for the RTC we used to uh i used to be the loan teller for a failed savings and loan and a couple of our customers would use the automated check writing uh-huh huh would they really programs yeah and it was i it was always interesting to see them it was like oh okay i recognize these who would be i i guess that would be a pretty good feature to use on that here they go yeah yeah well i've used it also for tax for about the past four years i guess and it's makes it real nice um-hum that would be good and um i guess that's mainly been it other than you know like like yeah we use it for games quite a bit yeah i'm kind of hooked on Tetris yeah i don't have Tetris but boy i'm glad to probably a good thing i don't well the shareware version i got has got like six different versions of Tetris you got a shareware version huh what's it um-hum it was like three dollars i've i like that it's it's pretty cool do you know what it's called i mean does have a um it's called Nyet N Y E T which is what is it in hm oh something about it's not not called Tetris you know it's like uh-huh right yeah and the other version's called Ain't ain't because it ain't Tetris yeah yeah well the the four letters i don't even remember what they stand for but it's it's a little yeah i mean what think of what that thing's called but it's it's a four word phrase that means no it's not Tetris it's really not but it's it's fun i like that and plus there's a a guy at work that he and i trade hm oh okay right oh boy different games like he's like well you know what do you have and i'll give you this and we trade well he's given me Jeopardy and Monopoly and Wheel of Fortune and uh-huh all right you got some good ones then oh yeah the only problem is the computer i like to play them on that's got the color monitor also i can't turn the sound off oh you can't turn the sound off yeah so i haven't figured out how to turn the sound off yet it's like oh because i i haven't really been into computers for except for about the last five years yeah um-hum at before then it was like get that computer out of here i don't want it around here leave me alone right uh-huh but i i've gotten to where i took a basic programming course out at Richland and i really i enjoyed that and i got little bit further into programming and i worked with a couple of our programming analysts down at uh Frito-Lay right and i thoroughly enjoyed that now it's like give me computer and consequently i am the person that everybody comes to at work it's huh how about that isn't that amazing oh it's it really is it's like hm amazing how this turned around she used to hate it now she loves it um-hum yeah yeah but i like it well well that's good it's fun well do you suppose we've talked long enough oh i guess we have that sounds pretty good all right well i think we've done our duty here anyway yeah i think so all right good to talk to you bye-bye thanks a lot Vic bye-bye  well what are your hobbies well actually my hobbies now are T-shirt making i'm making T-shirts and sweat shirts in fact that's what i was doing when you called well that sounds interesting what kinds of uh sweat shirts and T-shirts do you make um right now i'm making Christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and all that kind of thing okay is it silk screening or um no i'm have material that i cut out and then you um there's this stuff called Wonder Under that you under that you iron it on and then you iron that on the T shirt then you paint around it so it's real fun i started doing it as a um just for something fun to do and now i'm selling them and oh i see well how's it going that's great pretty good i just started last week and i sold seven i really wasn't expecting that so well that sounds great i guess in my spare time i'll be making T-shirts so well somebody has to do it that's right you know give you a little Christmas money anyway that's correct what are your hobbies well i i kind of have hobby fads i guess when i was growing up i was was into coin collecting and that dropped off about the time i hit puberty i guess and then um-hum my hobbies in high school went just to the sports now my latest one's is is classic cars i've um i had a sixty six Mustang that i was rebuilding but i almost had it done and i went on went ahead and sold it oh my gosh but it was fun i really enjoyed it now how'd you learn to do that oh you just to fix them up you just get a a book that tells you how to do it or what no you just kind of all i did was uh i bought the car and then uh you know you can i uh was just in a supermarket and i seen a a magazine for you know basically it was it was called Mustang Magazine and and so i bought it and they had uh um-hum some names some companies that sold mustang parts and i just started ordering some parts and and you know basically you know i what i did was i redid the whole interior i didn't do too much to the engine because the engine was pretty good but the the whole interior and then part of the exterior just kind of do it where'd you get the car well we lived we lived in South Dakota and i bought it up there before i moved down here wow so it was it was kind of rusted out there isn't too much rust on any vehicles down here well that's true that's true well that sounds neat well gee i guess there really isn't too much to talk about on hobbies that that about covers mine and T-shirt making about covers yours let's see well let's see i've done

still in New Mexico with my parents uh-huh i'm from New Mexico in New Mexico okay so let's see what else i started collecting music boxes i guess that's a hobby whoa yeah that is that's interesting how many music boxes do you have so probably uh uh about twenty do they all play different songs or do some of them play the same song um-hum they they all play different songs well that's neat what's the most expensive one you bought the most expensive i don't know i've gotten all of them for gifts i don't i've probably only bought a few of them i usually get them for Christmas gifts or oh really and like when people go you know to on trips or something well that that's interesting it used to be teaspoons was the thing so that's pretty neat that's true i've never collected those never collected those yeah that's interesting music boxes i have dolls from all over too that i started when i was a little girl and i have a lot of dolls people would always bring them when they'd go to the countries and well um and i did that when i went to Europe one summer i bought a doll everywhere we went so well how was Europe it's about to come to me it was great it was quick i was in the it was in high school it was in a tour and we went all it's kind of a it's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries and um it's called People to People and we'd stay in people's homes and then we got to also tour big cities and i really enjoyed it was that in high school or was that a college thing uh-huh it was in high school so i'd like to go back because we had you know everything was rushed everything we had like an hour or two hours at the louvre you know things like that where you need the whole day but i bet right but it really right that's where a a camcorder would come in handy exactly that's true well well that sounds real neat now let's see so you you haven't been back to Europe since though huh no i always thought i would but who knows now i got married and maybe some day maybe that's one of these retirement things there you go well does you husband uh what does he think of your uh T-shirt and and well he he likes it all right he's been pretty good because there's T-shirt stuff all over the house does he help out much or not  what basketball team are you well pretty pretty familiar with we moved here about six months ago or a year ago so i'm pretty familiar with the Mavericks most familiar with yeah where'd you move from North Carolina uh-huh well yeah the Mavericks uh have done fairly well in the past but doesn't look like they're going to do too good this year nope not doesn't look like maybe maybe they'll surprise us though reckon yeah that would be a big surprise it would be a big surprise yeah do you do you follow basketball oh i kind of follow it a little bit i'm not a great fan of it but uh you know i read a little bit about it and follow it on the radio and everything but i was glad to see them get rid of that guy Tarpley although by far the best player they've ever had i guess Tarpley yeah i think he i think he he was i i think it went on went on too long you want to get her out of here yeah it did it did and and they had to do they had to get rid of him but i couldn't believe they'd given him a contract like they had where that they couldn't get rid of him yeah well they already he already had uh two strikes against him when they gave him that contract yeah uh i guess they felt like that was enough that you know uh if that you know if if they had to get out of it they could and they wouldn't want out of it unless he did something wrong yeah if he did that well that'd cancel the contract i guess no that's true that's right if you get the third strike they can break the contract and if doesn't you want to pay him that much money because he's that good yeah yes that's right he'd be worth it yeah he'd be worth it yeah that makes sense uh did you uh see the score of their first game against San Antonio but there's gonna oh they got blasted didn't they yeah they lost by uh forty or fifty points hundred and uh yeah that was unbelievable i i'd i hadn't seen that score i just heard somebody talking about they'd gotten beaten real bad yep and uh but i think they did better last night though didn't they yeah they lost in overtime by a point or two yeah so that was a good game i guess yep i i really don't follow them that closely there although there was a good article today in the in the Sunday Magazine about uh Brad Davis did you read that oh yeah nope nope what did it say course uh well it just uh this is going to be his last year but it just you know he just been it's amazing that he's one of the original Mavericks you know still playing hm yeah i don't think i was aware of that he was an original Maverick huh he is the only original Maverick yeah he started out with them when they started and has made just to make the team every year since then so and you know you don't you don't make the team if you're not any good uh-huh yep so he's done well six hundred thousand a year is that right that's what he makes huh uh-huh and he's worth it i guess well how do you think they'll finish this year i mean huh not too good i imagine what do you think no i don't see how that nah they won't even they don't they won't they won't even come close to the play-offs i don't think hm i don't think so they're now they're aiming trying they're wishfully hoping i mean they've lowered their sites from play-off to maybe five hundred which and that's probably a pretty big stretch they what yeah yeah that's a big stretch probably yeah and uh but boy they you know they've had some darn good teams in the past yep yeah i guess that's why it's so hard to swallow you know right off the bat they started doing well but yep how do they you kind of wonder how they let themselves get to where they have such an old team yeah it makes you they've had some coach problems over the years uh Motta was probably the best they've ever had or ever will have but he i don't know he just he was such a hot head that he just quit one time oh yeah and man once he made up his mind to do something like that he gone he don't change his mind but he was by far i think the best coach they ever had uh-huh but he couldn't get along with with who i i mean Aguirre oh Aguirre yeah Aguirre um-hum and uh he he had a hot temper yeah i haven't followed them too close until uh we moved we moved here i you know i remember seeing them in the play-offs a couple of years ago i guess uh-huh uh-huh yeah probably yeah at least two years ago or longer it yeah but they did they used to have some darned good teams uh-huh but uh i've always been a and i don't follow basketball that closely but i've always been a a Celtics fan because i love i love to watch Larry Bird play uh-huh yeah i like watching the Celtics play they're uh they play uh have played a good brand of basketball it's real teamwork oriented always you can always count on them playing a good brand of basketball and of course so you can the Lakers so can you depend on the Lakers for doing that uh-huh but i don't know i just always liked old old Bird he just can do things that i don't think humans are supposed to be able to do with a basketball you know him and Magic Johnson and old Jordan uh-huh but we'll have to keep our fingers crossed i guess for the old Mavericks yeah it'll take at least that well and they got a they got a good owner i mean he's willing to spend the bucks to get what they need so i think it's just a just a matter of time till they it may take them a couple of years well i imagine it will they're down to i mean like their top there's four of their starting five are like thirty over you know thirty three thirty uh-huh yeah so you're talking you're talking about pretty well having to rebuild from scratch and that that's yeah that's just too old for a basketball team yep man old old Larry Johnson  hello Lynn yes okay do you have any pets yes i have a dog and cat now oh what are their names Tibby and Liberty which is the dog and which is the cat Tibby is the dog and Liberty is the cat yeah my wife and i we have we have two cats um one's real nice but the other one is uh well she's pretty wild oh ours are pretty calm yeah are they um just house pets um-hum yeah that's that's what ours are too yeah our cat we got from the pound the day before the night she was going to be put to sleep so that's why we call her Liberty oh really oh well that's a nice nice story um do you wanna hear about my other animals i've had i've had a skunk sure sure yeah i've had a Burmese python i've had rats i've had mice uh let's see had gerbils wow i have a i had a son he's now gone from the home that was a pet animal lover uh-huh so at one point i had a snake skunk dog and cat running loose in the house wow the um do the skunk uh was that kind of like a cat to have around the house yes yeah so it it was litter trained and we had it perfumed and um yeah um-hum it was very aggressive but all the all three of them dog cat and really skunk used to chase each other all through the house uh-huh and the only thing we have with the skunk he was very very protective of his territory the skunk oh yeah being the sofa and the blanket on the sofa nobody came near it when he was there hm oh um i had i had a dog one time and uh he chased after a after a skunk and got sprayed so we had to uh we had to give him a tomato tomato juice bath oh and uh and get him cleaned up yeah they um ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them but uh-huh the glands had been removed so right but i suppose it was still in the instinct of them to right to back off and get ready one other question we had is why do you have pets yeah why i don't know i i think they're kind of nice to have they're kind of i don't know just relaxing to i don't know to pet and to i don't know when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that just kind of enjoyable to you know have like i don't know something giving you some affection as well what what do you think yeah i always said if i died well i always said if i died i'd come back as a dog that'd be the best way to be oh yeah yeah yeah um do you like big dogs or or little dogs well we had a German Shepherd and he had dysplasia um-hum and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went really so when he died we got a little one yeah but our Shepherd was almost thirteen years old and it just you know it was almost cruel um-hum almost cruel for him to to walk because yeah he just he couldn't get up he couldn't walk so he was a hundred and twenty pounds so it was a chore wow yeah so we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened it would be easier to carry sure yeah it was something and then we've had three cats in our married life and we've got a calico now yeah we've got a calico cat too yeah yeah she's the she's the nice one do you yeah we um we used to live in an apartment and like our cats never went outside but um the neighbors used to let their dogs out and our neighbors were i don't know kind of slimy and um our cats wound up getting fleas um from the apartment that we were in um so we had to we had to flea bath them and that was uh that was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all yeah well don't even talk to me i when i was single i had gone away for the weekend and my husband then fiance was to keep my cat yeah and he let her out and my house was loaded with fleas i mean you walked in and your legs were just black really and we had such a time and never got the cat back really yeah i found it you know in the street ah i was a social worker at the time and found it it  i've uh oh uh are you there all right okay um yes sir i'm right here i'm in an area where um we can uh enjoy it year round so i've actually been uh uh been out within the past couple of weeks i'm mainly freshwater fisherman how about yourself well actually i've done both kinds uh i'm originally from the state of Virginia um-hum um-hum and uh lived uh near Virginia Beach where we could uh surf cast and uh catch a lot of things in the ocean there do you ever did you ever do the James River i don't believe i have fished the James River um there's a possibility but that was so long ago i moved here to to State College uh in nineteen fifty five and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and we have a lot of uh beautiful fresh water streams that come through this this area i'm in an area called Center County which is in the very center of the state of Pennsylvania i've i've been in that area and the trout fishing's supposed to be legendary the trout fishing is really uh beautiful as i say the the streams are oh eight ten fifteen feet wide and so forth and uh you you stand on the edge and you you cast out and you you work uh from your feet most of the time and then there are there are a few lakes of course close by uh-huh for brookies what do you like brookies or uh rainbows or well tell you the truth i'm i'm not uh not picky i wherever the area whatever the fish is the specialist in that area i uh i enjoy fishing for it and i try to i haven't fished in several years i'll have to admit um-hum but when i do fish i do contact uh some of the local specialists yeah so that i can then find out the uh the type of lures that they use and where they fish and any unique uh techniques that would help you do you fly fish or are those streams too small uh no we fly we fly fish um-hum yeah i used to do that a little when i lived up in New York but uh-huh right now it's uh uh bass and striped bass is the only thing that uh i go for down in Dallas in uh Texas oh that's a pretty big fish uh yeah they're they've uh the striped bass have accommodated themselves to the big fresh water lakes and they're pretty exciting when they're when they're running uh-huh it's a salt water fish in fresh water uh environment it's well well our our streams streams here are replanted with fish uh about every year it's all put and take so that well they they they uh they have a pretty good idea of of uh what what the number of fish are in these various locations and um-hum and they have have certain areas that they plant you know a hundred here and a hundred there and this is of course x number of weeks or months before fishing season opens so what's the season April to September October or something like that that sounds about right um-hum pretty close um-hum yeah what's a license cost yeah well as i say it's been several years but the licenses weren't that expensive i seems to sticks in my mind five to seven dollars is about all what i remember yeah uh-huh it's about the same as Texas yeah uh-huh and i have oh probably a a half a dozen different kinds of uh fishing poles and and fly rods and so forth and and i had been so busy in my work in these last few years that i haven't had time to fish but i'm going to be retiring at the end of December and i i hope uh the next fishing season that i can sort of get back in and uh enjoy that that that was a really enjoyable uh thing for me to do well i have all sons so i think i'm probably going to be fishing for a long time huh i just have one son and he he lives uh out of the state now or rather in the eastern corner of it so i don't think he has time to fish either i caught the disease from my father and i'm passing it on to my children it's really oh is that right they love it yeah oh my goodness well i i uh the disease i caught was simply because uh i was i was i was in the Norfolk Portsmouth area and people there there's there's so much water around that you you you're either boating or you're fishing right uh-huh right right and uh i fairly enjoyed it that time i have a small uh aluminum boat here that uh when i go on one of the large lakes that we have here that i enjoy fishing for for trout um-hum what what are the i i don't i don't know about the lakes in central Pennsylvania are there many from that well as i say i'm in Center Center County there's um there are two different size lakes about well five five to six miles from State College now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view but they are probably fifteen twenty acres maybe um-hum um-hum um-hum which which here is a lot of water where boats  um tell me something about your camping experiences Carolyn well um i have gone to girls camp a few times as a you know a chaperon or a leader whatever and uh i enjoy camping i okay we have we have a tent and we've gone even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove um i guess our our my biggest memory is when we froze to death we just didn't take enough blankets and where where do you go camping at around here whatever uh we went camping at uh Lake Bonham which is is pretty close here um we went fairly early uh in the season for this area which is probably April okay is when we went and and it got really cold at night and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things in the morning but sure uh what uh what activities do you do when you're camping oh we take little nature hikes and and uh we take along games that we can play with the with the kids and it's that kind of stuff usually try to have a um-hum uh occasionally a camp fire at night you know and roast the marshmallows and what all uh-huh well that sounds like fun i uh i grew up in South Dakota up in the Black Hills oh and so we used to go camping my dad would take uh there's there was four of us kids we'd he'd take us you know we'd all go camping my dad and my mom and and the kids and and it was always fun uh because what i always remember is my dad would let us pick our camp spot and uh he'd always tell us you know okay look for you know a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents and it always had to be somewhere near a a river so we could go fishing and hopefully we'd catch our supper but we never did hum but it was it was always fun we'd always mom was always prepared and she'd bring along something you know something because tradition had it we would never catch anything so we always had something along to eat but then we'd roast marshmallows roast marshmallows and it it was always an enjoyable experience uh about nineteen eighty two i moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills across the state to to Aberdeen and uh there's no hills it's flat and then i was in high school and uh couple of friends couple of my high school friends and i we'd go camping out by a river of course and and go fishing but by then of course i was able to catch uh catch some things but it was it was always fun it was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river um-hum you know in the hills we we would do like you did your folks did you folks did would take the nature hikes and you know and look for animals and we always you know in the hills you could see quite a few different animals but go ahead well we we used to live in Utah and uh course there's lots of mountains around there to camp in and and streams and stuff that's that's a great place to go camping and the hiking is just really great okay you know hike up those mountains is just really fantastic sure um now is there anything uh are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area i'm not acquainted with any you know i there's woods and things out in East Texas Tyler area you know there's a Tyler State Park that's uh really a nice camping area okay but it it's just a lot of trees it's not i don't know of any place in Texas that has uh really big you know what i call mountains um-hum i the Rocky Mountains are so much uh bigger than anything that they they've got down here that right um is the one in Tyler is it been a pretty commercialized i suppose no it's not well it's not too bad they have um screened in areas you know they're not really cabins i wouldn't say i guess they could call them that but they're they're more just a screened in uh camping area or whatever they're they're not bad okay help help keep the the pests out i suppose yeah yeah well that sounds i don't know if that can rate camping but you know it sure beats driving a thousand miles to to find a mountain i guess yeah that's right i i take it you haven't done a whole lot of camping in this area no we just moved down in in June oh i see well you're still uh getting you're just trying to get over the culture shock still yeah i'm still trying to find my way around i tell if i can get on Central from anywhere i'm happy yeah yeah well really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring and and in the fall okay uh it just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly i mean there's there's a lot  okay well what do you do on your yard well ah typical lawn stuff Saint Augustine ah with a little Bermuda mixed in in some of the sunny areas uh um-hum uh-huh and really all i do to it is uh in fact i didn't even fertilize it this year i just mowed it and i i mow it uh you know with a mulch mower so the the particles fall down yeah comes back in the yard so you don't have anyone do your yard you do it yourself yeah we do too i do it myself have a lot of people trying to do it for me but hey i need the exercise so what the heck isn't that the truth all flyer's on every door everyday that's right well we um we my husband does the same thing he does the yard and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower but i keep putting off learning hey you've got the right idea that's right but i had recently gone out and planted mums so we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago and so while my husband was painting i went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's um-hum and put out yellow and bronze and they just gorgeous and so then last week my mom comes in town and she says well those are gonna die just the first frost she said you should have done pansies and i went well now you tell me so that first night that on Halloween we went out and covered them with a sheet and they did okay that first night but the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it so i guess i've lost them yeah i haven't gone out to check yet yeah i wouldn't don't blame you i wouldn't wanna look at them oh listen but um the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here i guess it was about four years ago and we did not know in August to put down the uh whatever it is for grub worms uh-huh and the next spring i guess in that March every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed we'd have big whole patches come up have you ever seen it yeah yeah what grub worms do and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it it would just come off in the rake down to the dirt so we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off everything it took a lot of money and a lot of time so the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazanon yeah you you you think that's what it was uh mulch mulch mulch okay well oh yeah we found them yeah we found them we dug under there about an inch and you could see them they're real fat old white things and they said they turn into black bugs in the spring yeah yeah those kind of brown uh June what we call June bugs and some people call them May beetles and yeah yeah yeah but in but in the whole um-hum yeah June bugs is what i'd heard them called so anyhow occasionally i find them in the flower beds they said that every yard has some but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem oh yeah so that's the number one thing we do whether we fertilize or anything else just because we got burned so badly before yeah well i had some of that problem but mine was freeze it oh yeah that too you know two years ago or last Christmas is that what you're talking about yeah um-hum yeah yeah and i'm still replacing i'm still replacing that in the back especially under the trees um you know kind of slow and and as you say very expensive um-hum yeah i caught Wolfe with ah ah one ah one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents and i i bought about twenty of them and oh yeah i bet you did too and put those down in the spring uh well i put that you know that was laid that was like or the fall yeah because i started to say you can there's different times they say it's okay to do it yeah that was like September i think and i had to water it you know gosh yeah yeah keep it damp well my out here you know we don't have as many trees in Plano at least the area where we're over by Collin Creek Mall and but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front like the pittosporum all died and all those variegated uh things died so we pretty much go with that dwarf yaupon and that yaupon holly and they just live yeah you can you can stand those yeah they're pretty tough uh pittosporum is kind of borderline here and usually it'll do pretty well but uh you know every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals and it it zaps it um-hum yeah well it's kind of like one of these it's oh wax leaf wax leaf ligustrum is the same way same way um-hum that they warned me of that one finally and i said you know you need to either read Neil Sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery because a lot of places that would are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there and we didn't know the difference and every year we learn one more thing we didn't know before like about these mums it's like okay next year i'll do pansies yeah your list is growing yes and my backyard we had it really nice and then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy and so it was about i guess he's three now so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my oh yeah oh gee bushes and plants and brought them to the front door and the back door and laid them on the patio so it's like our backyard is just kind of like as long as he won't damage it fine and if he'll if there's anything he'll hurt we just don't put it out there anymore um yeah kind of cuts your possibilities for flower beds down um-hum very much very much i had a i had a small vegetable garden that uh it did pretty well it's it's like on the side the apron of the of the parkway out behind the garage and uh there's our our garages come in from the back you know from the alley you did huh uh-huh so do ours yeah and uh it's it's that little piece of land over there well i had uh tomatoes and and uh uh peppers what did you grow and i had had okra and cucumbers by the fence i had cucumbers that is amazing which which didn't do real well uh they kind of came out looking like gourds yeah well put them in a salad though you say well i made it though at least it's mine yeah but i had squash i had zucchini and and yellow crook neck squash  okay who do you like okay what kind do i like i like just about any kind except country and western yeah that same with me same with me it it's course country and western even i've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be uh-huh like Clint Black he's pretty good and who's the other big guy well in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks Garth Brooks yeah that yeah that's the other guy i was thinking of was Garth Brooks yeah fact i think both of them have performed here and Kenny Rogers he's kind of country western verge you know on the verge of country western right course Garth Brooks lives about uh you know his his home town is about uh fifteen minutes away oh wonderful so he is he's a home boy well then of course you like him that's great so well i have teenage children and so you know i'm hear the the rock music not the hard rock but the you know Michael Bolton type stuff he he's my personal favorite uh-huh my son is uh twenty eight so but he he's real unusual in that uh he likes a little bit of every kind he likes jazz oh that's good and uh blues and and course the rock um-hum um-hum i i can't say he's real crazy about elevator music as he calls it no no what i don't i don't think actually we don't listen to any elevator music at my house but i've got teenagers so well my teenagers are all gone i can listen to any music i want to yeah that's good i actually when i'm home alone which isn't too often but uh our public radio station has wonderful classical music it's just very wonderful soothing and you know uh a lot of symphonies and i just i love that that's probably my all time favorite you know uh i i teach hm and we can have music in the classroom but it you know it can't be the rock or anything like that and i i find that the classical music is very good for the kids too right it doesn't disturb them and yet it it's it stimulates them and and right relax yeah and uh what do you teach what grade well it's ninth nine through twelve good for you and well it's uh business technology a certain subject good for you but uh i was just sitting here while she was trying to find a a another caller uh i was reading my my husband and i are taking a computer class at our junior college oh boy yeah it's pretty good it's just a real basic class but we're learning a lot and we have a home computer so it's it's very interesting uh yeah i'd learn it too uh back to i guess we'd better get back to music though i uh yeah the subject of music do you play any instruments i play i play piano i took lessons for thirteen years and right now my nine year old is taking piano and i just got a whole mess of music i i play the volunteered to play the piano at the children's Christmas program for the whole grade school which is K through six ooh you took on a good job five hundred kids i did it last year and and um i sub i just sub at the school i don't wanna

listen to it and i love to sing um-hum and i my kids when i was little and they were little and i was rocking them singing to them they'd say um-hum  um we our subject is golf and that's a good subject that i like to talk about well good because i thought my goodness i'm i'm a definitely a beginner at golf oh are you do you play um i took lessons a couple of not last spring but spring before last and uh um-hum i really enjoyed it and i had taken years ago and i never could see that what i was doing was causing that little ball to do anything and so um but when went i took this time you know it actually went up in the air and and i i mean i could see that what i was doing made a difference and so um my husband and i uh took together he had played some yeah uh-huh already and then we started playing some and and we played in the summer a few times and then i teach and i don't have time to during the school year much but um oh that's the way to do it yeah um-hum right well you got weekends well it just seems like it just is all a it really does and then uh and in the spring we've we've been lucky enough to go to several of those tournaments around here the uh it takes a lot of time yeah it does one at Las Colinas and uh the Byron Byron Nelson and i've loved watching so i'm i'm definitely a good spectator for not so much on TV but you know for live uh-huh uh-huh um-hum well i even i enjoy it on TV uh it once you get into it a little more you'll enjoy it on TV also well now you know actually i have occasionally occasionally watched a little of it and i never did ever before i took these lessons my my son uh plays golf and he's oh he loves to watch it on TV so i guess if you play a lot you uh-huh uh-huh yes the more you get into it you you'll really enjoy it on TV too i think or or everybody i know that does right well how about well well what about you yeah i play all the time well not all the time but i try to get in at least we play where there's a little course go down East Texas and we go down there a lot in Mount Vernon where is that uh-huh and uh that is that very far no it's a hundred miles i'm originally from there and we go down nearly every weekend my folks live there so we have a place to stay and uh it's it's just so much fun when you got a regular group of your buddies you play with uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh sure so that's what i do and the wife took it up about two or three years ago and she's she's enjoyed it a lot but it's hard to get the girls to play you know uh-huh it is and uh so she doesn't really get to play you know enough enough not nearly enough although what she does she and i'll play sometimes you know and and she enjoys it but uh-huh uh-huh right and she enjoys playing with the girls but heck most of the time they're not all playing you know uh-huh and course i've got a group that i play with uh-huh so it makes it a little bit difficult there but we enjoy it it's a lot of fun and uh one of the best parts about it once she took it up was when we'd go on a little trip somewhere not long trips or anything but just little trips you know well it was always real good to to take our clubs and she could we could play golf oh i know i think that's that's great whereas before i probably wouldn't even get to play you know and now she enjoys playing with me and and we you know it it just makes the trips more enjoyable for me uh-huh sure so uh so uh how long have you been playing oh i've been playing probably twenty years or longer i didn't start it nearly as young as i should have i think i was about oh wow uh-huh twenty uh i don't know i guess i've been playing longer than that since i'm fifty i've probably been playing uh twenty five years uh-huh well um that i mean that's what they all say is that you know that's one of those things that you just can't start young enough yeah uh-huh well you most well you think you'd be better if you started early i'm not so sure that's true i see especially i guess if you you start early and you just get get good lessons and you do it right i guess and yeah some some people that helps but then some people are just good at it and some are not i i guess so it really is interesting uh now now you're gonna improve and it helps to take lessons and and play a lot you're going definitely gonna get better but i'm talking about the difference from being a so uh mid nineties to low uh high i mean a low nineties to a mid eighties shooter which that's what i am to being a guy that shoots in the low seventies uh-huh oh my well you're doing real well that doesn't sound like a lot of difference but believe me it's a lot of difference it really is well um uh did and so do you play around here some i used to play around here all the time but i don't any more since we just i just play down there now uh-huh where would you play here uh my favorite courses around here are uh Fire Wheel uh-huh and uh i i like Chase Oaks real well but it's kind of expensive oh so is Fire Wheel not as expensive no it's a it's a municipal course Garland owns it city of Garland owns and that's how oh well i i course have you ever played at Plano oh yeah Plano's a good course i've played there oh gosh ever since it's been there many many times well well is it competitive well we've played that's where we've played mostly we've played at Chase Oaks too but um it's an excellent golf course Chase Oaks is difficult you really need to be a good golfer to play Chase Oaks oh horrors i mean we just lose jillions of balls and yeah if you're not a really good golfer don't waste your time at at Chase Oaks yeah it's too that's discouraging isn't it  i guess we get started now yeah i don't know i you know i've always was interested in in woodworking i i watch a lot of the PBS stations where they have uh you know the woodworking um-hum uh shows and that but i've never really done anything myself because i don't really have the tools for it is that right but uh someday when i can get up uh enough of the tools i i wanna try and make a lot of the stuff uh i got books on it and everything and it shows you step by step on how to do it yeah but uh yeah i've never made made much myself i guess uh do they count uh uh let's see i guess tree houses and things like that don't count as woodworking woodworking do they well i think anything from you know building a house uh to cabinetry would be woodworking i mean i i think that would be classified that you built a tree house pretty good yeah oh yeah you know hold on a second you can't pull up hold on you can't pull up on it it will disconnect um yeah i've done tree houses and crafts you know craft type of things you know out of plywood and things of that so i have a a few saws i mean a few a few tools yeah yeah that you need for that kind of stuff just not a not like for uh book shelves well i can make bookshelves too i guess nothing like for cabinets or tables or things like that you know you have to have special some special things for that um-hum yeah but i mean i do household repairs i guess that counts as woodworking doesn't it yeah i think so i mean yeah uh you get skills in that and it helps you in almost anything you do so yeah yeah that's fine yeah i wanted a uh maybe i might try and uh even though i don't have too much tools but i don't think it takes too much to build a bookshelf i know i i need one so maybe yeah no it doesn't take too much for that my dad does a lot of woodworking i mean he makes like furniture yeah well it sounds like both our dads are good my dad made a a whole wall cabinet uh closet type thing uh and all he did was he hired someone once to build it and then he watched him and and he uh built it himself and he did yeah now what did he make a a cabinet yeah it's kind of a a a closet cabinet um built on a whole wall took up the whole wall and it's got uh the for hanging up shirts and pants area and drawers and all sorts of things in there it's pretty pretty yeah pretty fancy uh-huh uh-huh takes up a whole wall huh yeah i've always wanted to make furniture and stuff but the uh the tools and uh you know after watching my dad do it but the tools have gotten me in uh seems like it very time consuming i've never never with all my kids i've never had much time for that for the time consuming things yeah yeah i know uh i know watching these programs with some of the fancy tools they have yeah it it makes it so easy that i think almost anyone one could do it if they could afford the probably four or five thousand dollars for each item they got uh it just about everything it does um you know different things for for different cuts and that and uh i think it would make it so much easier but uh-huh i think that'd be more for the professional if you're gonna do it as a business uh those types of tools are fine yeah yeah well my dad doesn't do it as business and he's and he's got thousands of dollars worth of we got disconnected we talked for a pretty good while it was here it was on this end here yeah yeah are we still i'm still here hello hello hey what happened what what do they do when you're done do they just disconnect you yeah well i just got disconnected that's it you hang i think it's he's got a kid there it must've been  okay um i'm very unhandy in these things and uh i don't like to do anything myself yeah i like to have a service station i can feel confident about yeah i uh which is problematical i've been working on my car since or actually on on cars since i was probably about fourteen um-hum uh i've i've got a sixty six Mustang out in the back that i've been trying to get running here lately that's given me a lot of problems and the the clutch and stuff isn't working out right and every time i try to put the battery in it doesn't have enough charge on it so i have to take it over to a friend's house and get it charged up again try try it again it rained here all last week so i didn't get a chance to do it oh is it is the problem that it's hard to get the appropriate battery and other types of things for a a sixty six car uh no it's not i don't know exactly what it is with the battery i think it's just that every time i charge it up it it has to sit i i i went and got a new battery and brought it home and then it sat there for two weeks so i went over to a friend's house and charged it up and then it started raining so i haven't been able to do it for another week so i'll have to take it over there and get it charged again and maybe i'll be able to see if that won't get it going tomorrow but uh but my main problem's been my clutch i is do you rely on this car for for primary transportation or just excuse me i'm supposed to i'm sorry i said i said i'm supposed to it uh it's been down for quite some time now and i been having a lot of trouble with it so are you struggling to get around as a result yeah i have to rely on friends and parents and stuff like that so you you don't do any kind of car work or i try not to um try not to anyway yeah i can understand that i suppose i ought to learn to change the oil and things i can save a lot of money doing that yeah i think i can understand that i it's not the most fun in the world but it it like you said it is it is cheaper on yourself to to go ahead and do it yourself than go spend fifty sixty dollars to have somebody else you know just change your oil or something like that i mean it must be great to to to really understand what's what's going on and you can both do things yourself and talk confidently with people when you have to take it somewhere to get parts or whatever yeah yeah that's that i think that's what my next option is if the if the clutch doesn't work right to take it to somebody and see if they can't decipher what the problem is i i have a feeling maybe it's just that i've i've put too strong of a clutch in it because i've got it's a it's a straight six two hundred with a three speed transmission in it and i've tried to put a racing clutch in it which i think is gonna you know i think that may be what my problem is it's it's too much clutch for the amount of engine i've got but uh we'll see was it easy to get a more appropriate clutch pardon yeah it's it i just go to my neighborhood parts store and get another one it's that when i when i had to rebuilt engine engine rebuilt i decided to try a um a better clutch so that i'd quit changing them out every six months i i have a slight lead foot you have a slight a slight lead foot yes it means it means i've always got my foot in the gas and and and the other one in the in the clutch so i i burn up the clutch a lot oh it's not good for it but uh um any any questions you have about uh anything anything easy to to work on or whatever or are you trying to get yourself into working on cars or what well the car i drove is an eighty four and it's reached the point yeah where various things are are going wrong with it and it's had to be in recently yeah it needed a new battery it wouldn't start um yeah my wife and i did manage to to uh recharge the battery from the other car um and the exhaust system has needed work and um yeah uh so the latest work done it just yesterday was to have the front wheels aligned yeah uh so we've been spending don't don't don't tell me let me guess your warranty just ran out and now everything goes wrong right yes in fact in fact on the battery uh uh it's the old one it had a four year warranty and the day it gave up was four years and six days typical i i don't i don't know what it is somehow another car manufacturers and the manufacturers of new parts for them uh they put their warranties on there and they know exactly when they're gonna run out when the when the part is gonna is gonna break down  oh i guess uh this is a a topic near and dear to my heart since i am a uh am a healthy eater well i I try to be as well well i'm not uh i there really isn't any kind of particular food that i i don't don't like really and i like a good Italian restaurant or a good uh um uh-huh uh especially like good prime rib so if it's uh nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that and i live here in uh Rome New York and there are a lot of good restaurants around here um-hum oh you're in New York i was gonna there's a place if you ever make it to Dallas they have the best prime rib it's called Lawry's like Lawry's seasoning salt and it is absolutely wonderful uh-huh uh-huh really and uh we were there a few months ago and it i mean it's kind of pricey well from New York it probably doesn't matter but well no i i'm in upstate New York and it's actually very inexpensive i there's a there's a place um half a mile from me here that uh oh is it okay has uh fantastic prime rib for uh eleven dollars a whole meal you know a potato and salad and soup and the whole whole nine yards so it wow uh-huh yeah well i think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen and it includes you know salad and rolls and oh some other stuff but it is absolutely wonderful it's the best i have ever had right yeah i was going to this place up the street from me is the best i've ever had so i'll have to go there when i get there get to Dallas yeah well yeah well we like uh lots of people down here like Mexican food uh-huh sure so um that's i i think Italian and Mexican food are probably my favorites uh-huh but um i'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff no no i'm not into the the don't do the the raw raw fish like that but i do like uh like a seafood bar like a raw raw bar like oysters and things like that uh uh-huh that they uh i go on i'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business so i uh find myself down in Melbourne Florida every about once once a month once every two months or so and uh oh okay uh-huh go and hit the the oyster bars down there quite a bit uh i love that oh yeah get fresh seafood down there and um and uh Maryland's great you get the crabs it's like i can't go anywhere where i i where i don't enjoy myself so uh-huh yeah yeah seafood seems to be a little a little bit more expensive than than other types of food that's true but but it sure is good and it's supposed to be good for you yeah well yeah it's really strange that that that seafood is so expensive because when you in reality uh uh i say that the oceans have the greatest resource resource of food on the planet and yet we haven't as human beings haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically so right right we've managed to uh figure out how to get at just about everything else but uh but not uh not seafood uh-huh do you like uh spicy foods or what yeah yeah i like yeah i'd make a a wicked chili and uh like around here the big spicy thing is like uh buffalo wings oh uh-huh and so uh people they you know you go out to get the chicken wings and those are really hot and the hotter the better and yeah yeah well we uh we like spicy food down here especially uh the hot sauce Picante sauce or salsa whatever y'all call it and uh we we sure go through a lot of that right sure yeah but i like it hot but i don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running uh-huh my my generally my my scalp will start i can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot it's like weirdest weirdest sensation almost like a tingling but uh i don't know but uh yeah well there isn't isn't too much in the way of restaurants that i don't like things that are kind of oddball like uh Thai cuisine i i never been yeah really fond of that stuff you talk about spicy that'll that'll literally blow your head off it's so hot and i can handle just about any kind of food without uh um uh-huh well but that that stuff is goes one notch beyond uh my tolerances so uh-huh although i guess on this topic i talk about the uh service in a restaurant is always nice though too that's one thing what's that yeah oh yeah and and the price and the price make you wanna come back well i find that lately that so many people are working you know they're working waitressing jobs or waiter  ah i guess my personal opinion i i don't mind paying taxes necessarily i I just sometimes wonder if our money's being used in the best way right ah sometimes when i hear what what they're even what even what the politicians are making you know when when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that ah i think that's just a bit too much to be paying them ah and that's all tax money when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much it's just billions of dollars that's i think is just being thrown away right right and then when you read about that they're spending all the money on you know these studies that have no relevance whatsoever that kind of ticks you off too but uh yeah somebody somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying it's not that we mind paying taxes it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government yeah and i i i tend to agree with that i'm not really into yeah what they're doing per se and i think there's just too many too many levels of bureaucracy yeah i think it can be can be managed by by less ah less levels yeah yeah well i i know anytime there's there's a big uh uh budget cut you know i work with the state and anytime there's there is a budget cut or crunches it's always the small guy that that gets hurt right it's never the uh the person that's making a hundred thousand there it's always the person that's making the least amount and right ah and and sometimes we're running around there i see these these ah ah supervisors running around ah having meetings i i really don't know what they do i sometimes wonder are are they really doing anything or right right well i think we're gonna see a streamlining in the government i just you know i i don't know what kind of uh i don't know what what level or what how long it will take for you know our country to start the public in general to start saying hey this is too much we're not gonna pay anymore you know we're not gonna pay for this and you're out you know i think we're starting to see it a little bit now but i think uh i don't know what what kind of input we're gonna get from the public and how they're gonna go about doing it because i think i think we're just getting taxed way too much i mean right now we're getting taxed probably yeah probably around thirty five percent or more and that's that's you know that's me not making a whole lot of money yeah well they got so many hidden taxes that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying because go to a grocery store or something like that and you're paying a little tax here and you well right so yeah gas i don't know about you guys i but there's probably at least about twenty five to to thirty cents of different taxes on on our gas right and you don't realize it yeah we got a sales tax our sales tax is like eight percent and i don't know what our gas tax is i think it's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon yeah so i mean they're hitting us up and they may not they may not raise it you know federally as much one year but then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the or the sales tax or property tax or whatever it's just i mean you can see that you're money is just not going that far yeah well i know they say like with Reagan they say no new taxes but they changed the ah deductions on you and that just raises your taxes you know they just get it a different way right so i mean to me it did uh raise my taxes right well i mean you can tell just by just by how much money you have left over and all of a sudden i don't know it's just it's eating me alive yeah i i heard someone say that uh if they would just something about uh with the uh the defense budget all that extra money they're throwing back if they cut back by so much percentage it could throw back about six hundred dollars on an average six hundred dollars  okay well Carolyn the uh one of the main things i'd like like to know is uh how do you feel about the knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth what do you think would be required and so forth well uh i'll tell you i i watched what went on um with the Twenty Twenty show i don't know if you saw that a few days ago that that talked about nursing homes and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where i am here in Texas and oh you knew of the homes then you knew of the homes themselves pardon well i no i'm not familiar with those homes per se but um they were in the area where i live uh-huh oh okay um and it was really revealing to see some of the you know the things that go on i guess in some of these homes so i would definitely you know want to really check things out and uh go i guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that to to make sure that you went daily you know and made sure that they were cared for and yeah well from your point of view how would you feel about actually sending someone that that's you know means something to you to one of those homes i realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it and of course that makes sense but uh-huh how do you think they would feel i should say about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new new home situation well actually i have that kind of situation because my mother lives with me and she's eighty seven uh-huh oh okay and uh from the time that we were tiny she said you know i want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home uh-huh so i know how she feels about it you know if i uh if i ever had to put her there i think uh it would be probably when i just could not handle it any more you know if i yes uh-huh she got to the point where she was totally bedridden and and i mean i just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed i think that would be the well how do you find that your your personal relationship is with her know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal does that does that cause any problems between the two of you uh i wouldn't say any more than usual uh-huh is she i think it's very hard for her um to be waited upon so to speak i mean i think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to it's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life at the level that you did before isn't it yeah i think that's very true yeah um on the other hand it takes on almost a a switch of a mother child relationship it is different i had that almost similar situation my mother lives in an apartment with my sister uh oh and uh so i except for the three or four months this summer that's the only time i ever spent with my mother and of course since i see her only once or twice a year i was just thrilled to have her here with me and i spent every minute i could to be with her and uh cooking foods for her you know just to make her her life as though she were on vacation uh-huh uh-huh but somehow another it that doesn't work between my mom and my sister and they they find they they are in speaking they i don't know my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there and i guess it's just because they're there all the time uh-huh yeah so it's it puts has put pressure on both of them from that point of view so that's that's kind of bad news and by the same token my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home and after all she has been a farmer's wife for sixty years and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm into another home where the environment is totally different um uh-huh she's relatively happy but she doesn't like the food and when she complains about the food then everybody gets angry with her so that's another one of those things you have to solve huh uh-huh yeah well that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's as you say lived on a farm for sixty years and then go to something like that yeah after all their their life is so totally different because in those early days the food they had to make it from scratch so to speak i mean you raised your own chickens and you killed your own hogs i suppose and then they they had to store the meat in uh uh-huh yeah i don't want to say barns but they had regular little places they they would hang it you know to cure it and so forth and uh-huh and now all of a sudden it uh comes in differently it tastes differently that's right yeah  okay i'll let you start this time well how much do you like lawn and garden work well ah even though it's totally out of my ah my degree training i've been working as as in the horticultural aspect uh for the last you i don't know fifteen twenty years so uh i'm well i work for the state as as a groundskeepers oh oh for goodness sakes what do you do uh-huh well that's interesting um so at this time of the year are you doing much garden work no mostly snow removal which we've had a lot of but uh i don't know i i guess uh growing up on the farm and and that i i've always had a big interest uh i have a uh right when i have an area to do i i always had a big garden and uh-huh enjoy working on lawns and and everything well i love to work outside really and i enjoy flowers and stuff i don't do a whole lot of it um at this exact point in my life um because i have two teenage boys and so they do all the lawn all the lawn care um-hum but i still take care of the yeah flower beds and things like that i was even planning to go out and to uh dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here but you know were planted in the ground since last spring um-hum and i was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me and lo and behold about five days ago we had a freeze down to about oh twenty three degrees or something um-hum so the hibiscus hibiscus plants no longer exist and i really feel bad about it it's a plant that we've had for probably twenty five years that these were cuttings off of you know oh that's terrible twenty three degree yeah yeah so they're all gone at this point gardening in Texas is really interesting though i grew up in Illinois yeah and um Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry why you know everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has land um a watering system uh-huh and so with that why our lawns do stay um you know pretty nice all summer if you water but in the winter we have Bermuda grass huh um-hum and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack right yeah and and i just think it's ugly when i go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter you know and their grass is fairly green um-hum yeah that's one one aspect of a lot of those grasses they go dormant yeah i think the ah Saint Augustine and uh centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there yeah those two um-hum um-hum yeah some people have i think it's fescue yeah that stays green all winter but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer um they have to water an incredible amount but um those lawn those lawns look nice during the winter but you know they almost stick out like a sore i guess not a sore thumb a pretty thumb but you know when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except for one you know it's sort of like well yeah well i know my folks live uh in Arizona there and uh you know they just grow rocks and and stuff there well and that's their gardening there so uh i guess as long as you can have ah some grass there right so i know i was uh in uh Houston and i i was working for a company once and we were taking care of lawns out there and uh that particular year they had just tons of rain it was raining continuously so um-hum and then i know with all that moisture a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems yes that's true yeah Houston is a a lot um a lot wetter than than Dallas Dallas area that's where Plano is and um and just humidity um-hum you know just all the time it's an awfully lot more humid are are you uh able to get uh sometimes a double crops of of certain things in your garden uh yes uh-huh i think people do yeah i don't have a vegetable garden haven't for i guess i never have here actually but um but yes uh-huh i'll we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio  okay what kind of car are you gonna buy next well one of the cars i'm thinking about buying next is uh a nice safe small car but um uh the reason being is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family and we use that to get back and forth and to haul kids around and uh-huh uh-huh so forth and we have another four door car that i drive to work and i think it'd be more economical if i were able to get a smaller car and uh wouldn't be wouldn't cost much with gas uh-huh that's true that's true what what are you looking at well i'm really not looking at anything for a while but you know when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out and you think oh well maybe maybe i would like a new car um-hum oh yeah but i think i'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway but uh oh yes oh yes well the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the right they are i sure do like the looks of that new Mitsubishi Mitsubishi Diamante when you oh yes oh yes that is a pretty car and i'm uh i really like the looks also of the new Mazda uh-huh that's pretty too that they have but um i uh you know the the cost of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now yeah they get pretty expensive yes they do the last one i bought i bought a uh well it's a it's a Town Car but it was a demo returned um-hum and i got it with like you know i think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars off less than what the list price was right well you can't go wrong with that kind of a opportunity so i was really pleased to find that and i then i bought it for cheaper i was looking at a Honda Accord a brand new one and i bought this uh the the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what i was gonna buy the new Honda Accord yes wow well you get a much bigger better comfortable ride and the thing about it is they give you that ten uh that that hundred thousand mile mile five year warranty where it only costs you twenty five dollars to have anything repaired yes well that's fantastic that's real real good so uh i have really been impressed i said i'll probably never be able to find another one that i can afford you know but i have loved this car better than anything i've ever driven because you you can go on the road and get there and you're not even tired no do you a very comfortable smooth ride huh and it gets like twenty six miles to the gallon on the road oh it does that's that's unbelievable for that size of a cars it sure does i had they kept telling me that and i thought they're crazy so the week after i got it well actually before i signed the papers on it i took it over to Boozier City and it did it yes wow that's great that's great that kind of gas mileage uh we're we're kind of hoping for on our van but it uh yeah well that's kind of what we've always been told you know they'll do it and then we hope for it and it never happens but it really it does get good gas mileage uh-huh well that's excellent did most of the time when i don't go anywhere i can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work you know and then fill it up so um-hum do you uh do you does it uh need a lot of repairs is it very reliable kind of car i haven't had anything i've taken it in twice for like just really minor things and it cost me the twenty five dollars the uh really really something really silly when we first got it we couldn't get the light they have all these lights in the car and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the backseat and we couldn't get the light to turn off yes yes hum and we kept kept trying you know and we went out to dinner with some friends and it stayed on all night you know just shining right down on them you know oh dear oh dear and we couldn't get it to turn off and the next day my husband goes out there and he tries to get it off we turn the knob you know in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off and we turned everything we could and he took it in and um-hum um-hum they said you know you just have to press the switch he says i've pressed every switch in that car and i can't get the light off it's broken so they took it in and charged us the twenty five dollars and they called and told us though that all you have to do is turn the off switch and they showed us where the switch was yes they charged you twenty five dollars just to tell you that huh they they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch but he hadn't he hadn't done the right one and it's right on the arm rest in the back and we didn't know it was there uh-huh oh so they probably went through the i see um-hum oh okay and the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car and found it right away huh and so we thought you know there it was broken uh-huh but we've had just uh i guess it's been in two times i've had it three years now yes and uh it's been in two maybe three times but it's just been real minor things well i think that uh you have an excellent deal then and the the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs that's right whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all so um-hum that's right but it's really it's been an enjoyable car like i say i'll probably never be able to have another one because i think we bought it for about sixteen thousand you know and i said i'll never find another one for that price yes no not at all and they keep going up so i'll have to enjoy it  oh what's your favorite TV show oh you know i used to like Saint Elsewhere that's one of my old favorite um and that's i'm being beeped so i'll just ignore it uh-huh um and now i i did like Thirty Something um-hum oh yes my daughter says 90210 we like that one yeah that's one of my favorites good and how old are you i'm twenty eight oh so you're little bit younger than i am but yeah i think it my seventeen year old my fourteen year old my other two children like it i'm over forty and i like it i think it's wonderful yeah it's a good show i like uh Murphy Brown and Designing Women

would be better why because it's pretty fattening i'm talking to my daughter um um All My Children i've watched that for about twelve years yeah i've i'm sure i watched it for more than that probably twenty some i used to uh General Hospital when i was a teenager doesn't i quit watching General Hospital when Leslie got killed oh and so that was a long time ago i used to watch it when in high school and college and and when Laura's mother got killed that she was my favorite character on there i right i just i read the reason she got she they they killed her off was because they couldn't settle the contract and i said well if they're gonna do that to her i won't watch it and oh that's great well i do like All My Children and i and i like it you know i don't know i just i like the people on it i guess you know i i i i like it i just wish they'd bring some of the old characters back yeah well Tad's gonna come back i bet do you think yeah i'm i'm sure he will he'll be he'll come back show up at the just the right moment i kind of wish that uh Nina would come back because she because the story you you know just for a brief visit or whatever because it never has been resolved with Palmer remarrying and and everything oh yeah like Daisy pops in once in a while and i forgot about Nina and Cliff right yeah Cliff on The Young and the Restless now oh he is so he's out for good yeah he's out for good did they marry um Nina Cliff that's how they left the show but not in real life hm now she's married to some guy in New York and she's happily married and that's the reason she left the show i guess she wanted a private life oh okay oh see i i i watch it maybe twice a month so i don't watch it everyday like i did when i had babies oh well i'll i i'll watch because i play lots of tennis and i'm gone a lot so i don't get to watch i watch it every day religiously i'd videotape it when i have to miss it yeah oh no kidding i used to be i used to be like that i'm that way about a lot of different shows i'm that way about Murphy Brown Designing Women now isn't Designing Women don't they have a new chick on there instead of the instead of what's her name uh yeah there's two new characters on there there's um uh Jan Hooks from Saturday Night Live i don't know if you know her or not and then huh-uh that's the show i like and then um uh the blonde headed girl that used to be on Newhart oh yeah oh i i don't like her on it i never have liked her so well i i just know which one she is i don't you know she she's taken the Suzanne's part and then uh Jan Hooks has taken Charlene's part there's Charlene was Delta Burke uh Charlene was Jean Smart the blonde headed oh okay well see i never watch that one either i really don't watch a whole lot of TV just you know on Sunday night Life Goes On comes on about the time that we eat dinner and my whole family's home because i don't allow the kids out on Sunday night you know because they got to go to bed and go to school the next day yeah and so we we sit around and eat popcorn and oh we then we watch America's Funniest Home Videos those are always pretty cute well that Murder She Wrote comes on opposite of that and so i that oh so you got watch that one instead of yeah i i i pick nights uh pretty much so on on TV that i watch different networks but Beverly Hills 90210 i i watch it religiously sure yeah we like that real well we like that it will be sure to watch it tomorrow night because somebody's getting killed on it tomorrow night um-hum i know they kids already know who it is i don't know who it is though who is it ask them let me ask Nicole Nicole  hi this is Donna Donahue hi Donna ready to get started hi ah yeah i think so okay sort of an interesting topic since i just got back from lunch here oh okay well what did you have for lunch oh it was uh it was i'm an officer in the Air Force and we went to the Officers' Club for a little Mexican food today oh oh well that's interesting okay so our topic is is food today is that okay yeah yeah yeah if you're having a dinner party what what would you serve okay uh do you want me to go first sure okay if i was having a dinner party i would probably um have some um some uh um some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and um probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some ah ah salsa and chips around and peanuts and then i would have um let's see i usually have like a little theme when i have a dinner party so um i would have maybe um say if it was like Greek night or something um maybe um on the barbecue we'd put um uh-huh uh-huh cubes of lamb or i guess lamb used for Greek and um like a shish kebab and um mushrooms and tomatoes and onions and then we'd have um uh-huh like a big Greek tossed salad kind of like a Caesar salad and um let's see what else um maybe some rolls and um i guess some um some rice or something like that um-hum jeez well well when's the party here how's that sound yeah um yeah that would take some planning but i don't know being a being the bachelor here that i am i i don't think i i'd be nah nah it i mean it it's not a question of capability here to do something like that it's just there's there's no motivation that's right you know i wanna i wanna throw some charcoal on the grill and and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that but um oh that sounds good too but i have um i have three kids so um uh-huh when we have friends over i have my oldest kind of babysit for the little two younger ones upstairs and um usually we just have very plain kind of you know interesting not very interesting meals pizza and that also uh-huh once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun but it's not a not a regular thing yeah um now we supposed to talk for about five minutes is that it okay yeah it yeah that's what they they're shooting for here okay um let's see now what okay so you would have a barbecue wouldn't well i live on a i live on a lake here and uh so uh-huh it it during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors like that's a little more ah casual thing but in mine in the wintertime it's not bad too because then i've got a oh sure you know fireplace and a nice nice house and all that so it's uh uh really good place to do entertaining like that i just haven't uh really tried a whole lot but uh uh-huh oh that sounds wonderful uh-huh i don't know let's see i have had well one time i did have a dinner party i served a uh uh had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits and kind of southern uh southern food even though i'm up here in New York so i um-hum oh oh you're in New York right now oh i'm i'm in Texas i didn't know this was all from all over the whole country oh i see and i'm from originally from Long Island yeah oh yeah yeah it is it oh no kidding yes and now where are you in New York upstate Rome a Griffins uh Griffins Air Force Base oh upstate oh okay oh okay is that where you you're originally from around there well i was born in Buffalo and uh been all over the place oh okay oh wow that's interesting okay let's see um well i like to have um sometimes when i have a dinner party i'll have um everybody bring something yeah and that's real interesting because then you get different um different kinds of foods and new recipes and um ah sometimes somebody will bring something that you really like and get recipe from them and whatever right and we just getting interested in in Mexican food because here in Texas they have lots of really good Mexican restaurants and um uh-huh sure we're we're just getting into the fajitas and all that stuff that you could do you know what a fajita is yeah okay yeah yeah i've been down to Texas a few times and uh had uh the pleasure of their good Mexican cuisine down there yes they have some delicious delicious things and i um sometimes make uh chicken burritos that just take chicken breasts and you boil them maybe like four chicken breasts and you boil them till they're cooked uh-huh um-hum maybe like thirty minutes and then you debone them and and kind of shred them up if the meat's gotten cooled and you take um salt little bit maybe two tablespoons of butter and a frying in a big frying pan and chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt  uh uh do you have any uh particular books that you've read lately that are are good books that you've enjoyed i haven't read much lately i've always reading is one of my favorite things but somehow the last few months i just haven't read i've read more magazines than books it's which is most unusual for me but um have you read anything lately not real lately when they came up with this topic i thought gee i read a lot of books and now i thought what have i read lately um why what whoa i can't i know i read a bunch a few months back but i can't remember the titles oh oh isn't that funny i will have to say i'd have to go look around my room for the books i've read and they're still stacked there oh well it seems like i've have read a lot of children's books lately to my my kids and things like that but well now i have too well i have grandchildren and uh the oldest is two but he you know loves books so so i have read more of those myself oh huh lately i did buy the sequel to uh Gone With the Wind the other day oh and i've read the first chapter and and i thought it was real good and i have not even picked it back up you know and Gone With the Wind is my all time huh favorite book you know so you would have thought i'd a had the whole thing read by now oh is it by the same author no uh no see Margaret Mitchell died uh oh maybe ten years after she wrote Gone With the Wind and she that's the only book she ever wrote oh and uh so the heirs to her estate after fifty years picked this Alexander Ripley i think is her name to write the sequel which she did and um-hum well that may that may be the reason you can't get into it as as much oh no no it it it was very good it it brought all those characters back to life i just i just well i don't know i've just been busy and i just haven't read oh uh-huh where i've i used to find time yeah i yeah you know if i get reading a book i like to just close the door and just read you know and even stay up really late at night and and just stay into it until i finish uh um-hum um-hum i used to be that way but yeah sometimes it's hard to do that with our lives well i get well i'm fifty three and i you know i just get sleepy and i go to bed early so where i used to do that years ago i don't anymore and i do i work my husband's an accountant and we moved our office home about two years ago oh so i work at home but i have a lot of work to do you know um-hum and uh then when i'm not doing that like i have my grandkids a lot because my daughter travels and she has a twenty month and then a four month oh so that's why we're going to Plano today that's where we pick them up at day care i see oh i see well some of the books that i have read um that i really enjoyed getting into was um the one Ellen Drury books you know Advice and Consent and have you ever read any of those now is that like a classic it really is um i mean i mean written quite a ways back that you like maybe read in high school or something or am i thinking of a different one with that name it's been around awhile but it's not you know it's not from the eighteen hundreds or anything this is it's a book um it's written in the nineteen hundreds and it's written uh about what goes on in Washington you know in the Senate and the House and oh no that's not what i was thinking of the President and everything and um it really gets into kind of the wheeling and dealing type thing and it's just it gets really fascinating i didn't think something like that would catch my interest but uh the way it's written and everything it is excellent it just really uh it's well worth reading oh yeah uh-huh i'll be darn okay well i sure wish i could remember what i've read so i could tell you something i did read that oh gosh oh there's another book out that's called All I Ever Wanted uh Needed to Know I Learned in Kindergarten have you ever heard of now i have seen that what is that about that's just real cute it's um it's just got a lot of ideas in it about basic things you know that we do and um you know things that you learn in kindergarten that that really apply to your life um there's one little section in there that that talks about um oh uh-huh uh holding hands and sticking together and um you know having cookies and milk and wouldn't it be nice if we could all still take a nap in the afternoon you know and it's  what you want to start uh it it uh it doesn't matter um we're discussing the capital punishment i believe and um right yeah right yeah i i suppose i should of which i am am pro capital punishment except that i don't like the way it's done uh-huh uh yeah i i i uh i guess i i hate to see anyone die uh but uh i guess these people that go around and and kill children and um-hum women and everything else without any remorse uh i don't think they deserve to to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives i i agree i i'm capital the capital punishment is necessary in in many cases but uh the it's not a deterrent um or our jails would not be so full there wouldn't be so many people on Death Row um-hum i think it needs to be something uh uh a throwback to where they did a uh public execution where it's visible yeah uh something you know not gruesome but but something where where people knew that it was it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people if you committed a certain crime you were going to receive a death penalty and it was going to happen to you yeah no stays of execution no no loopholes no well and and even even that i don't really know if that would help i think lot of these people do it uh mainly because of of TV and and double double reason mainly they they see it being done on TV and also the fact of of notoriety i mean they become well known they are almost like like a big star notoriety um-hum yes yes but but they they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal they know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years yeah uh-huh that they're going to write a book they're gonna go on talk shows they're gonna that that that's a reward yeah uh for a heinous crime rather than uh having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life right in in complete uh advance of any notoriety yeah well i i i think if they went according to uh the Bible where it does say an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a life uh you take a life you give yours um-hum right right uh uh uh that's for sure there's exceptions to the rule i mean if if it's an accidental taking then uh you look at that but you know most of these people that down right go right and and do it out of pure pleasure um-hum uh i don't uh like to see that i guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent it is a deterrent in the in the sense that that person will never do it again well yes they will it not not not if he's killed he can't do it again oh and it yeah well correct that's correct yes yeah if if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is it is executed yes the death penalty uh-huh but but the the the chances are not great that that will happen right yet there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years um-hum yeah well i i guess i'm also looking at beyond even that i i i guess i been thinking about it and i don't have a definite opinion but uh repeat uh crimes um-hum uh maybe not the the more mild ones but you know a more severe ones especially on armed armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people and not just taking the money but um-hum beating them half to death that right just for pleasure too and yes i i guess you got to look at something like that do they deserve to uh remain on this earth too well you you know you you could carry it uh to that if uh if they are a repeat offender and and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up um you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes and of course uh uh battery or assault or that's not a capital crime so you you wouldn't be able to under our system right right now China and a few other countries have a little different view of that um you get caught with dope there and you die period yeah um-hum there is there is no no appeals there is no  okay what type of things do you feel would invade your privacy everyday um hm well i don't like it when um people listen to my phone conversations like if they're outside my door while i'm talking in my room or when people like look through my things in my bedroom yeah that's right that is really an invasion of privacy yeah i find i find it very annoying when i've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly with solicitors and the carpet cleaning companies and does that happen in your part of the country um-hum yes um-hum definitely i uh i come home and i'm trying to get a few things done and i can't do anything but answer the telephone right some evenings are worse than others but i wish i could put a stop to it but i don't know what to do to stop it right even uh we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting and they'd still come to our door and knock and um-hum they'll think it didn't mean them i guess everybody but me oh goodness i guess not no yeah are you still do you live at home with your parents yes um-hum um-hum so your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family yeah yeah mostly yeah now what can you do to stop that oh i don't know well i'm used to it now but sometimes it still gets gets to me but there's not much i can really do no no just have to live with it i guess try to remember to respect their privacy and maybe they'll respect yours and you know it well i don't know i always um no yes i do but they don't live at home do you have brothers oh okay i was raised i had two younger brothers and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations and oh i used to do that though because i was the youngest i'd pick up the phone and listen to theirs but i i would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldn't hear me and then they'd go get on the other extension and i could hear them but i couldn't get them to hang up you know oh i yeah but i stopped doing that a long time ago and they still do it to me even it in the office i uh find that people walk up and and when you're on a conversation instead of walking off or just making themselves busy they'll stand there and listen to what you say until you hang up oh like say yeah this lady does that to me at work when i'm taking an order or something and she'll just sit there and listen and like i'm doing something wrong and she just started and she's nice but uh-huh okay but you know it gets annoying when they stand right over you and watching everything you do um yeah but i'm let's see i can't think of anything else i'd really consider an invasion of privacy other than the phone solicitors about the only thing that really bothers me i don't have that many people coming to my door no right well occasionally we'll have a person here or there but not not as many as the phone calls you know so uh-huh and i guess that's really the the thing that really bugs me the most i can't think but that her kids in our neighborhood used to bother me but they have all gotten grown up now and we live in a neighborhood where there's not any little kids to bother me since mine are all grown up but uh yeah what else would be an annoyance well i guess traffic could be an annoyance oh yeah especially when you're in a hurry do you have a lot of traffic in your area um it can get busy yeah usually on the weekends it's the most bit but um-hum some days it's real real bad here and you would like to feel like it's an invasion of privacy because you can't even ride down the road without people all the way around you you know but yeah um-hum yeah i've traveled quite a bit and i've been through Dallas Texas it's pretty busy it really is and pretty noisy yeah it really is yeah i live right on a main thoroughfare so when i first moved here i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy because it at first you'd hear a lot of noise especially at night you know when you go to bed um-hum oh yeah and every time a a fire truck or anything went down the road i'd wake up but i guess i've gotten used to it because i don't even hear it anymore oh yeah i suppose you do and uh i just close it out i guess because i don't i don't remember waking up in several years at night when i'd hear a fire truck go by you know um-hum yeah i think they'd probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me yeah i'm am a real sound sleeper though so that probably wouldn't bother me i'd sleep right through it they'd have to chop down the door and get you out i guess yeah it takes a lot let's see what else is an invasion i had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time i was mad because those are mine you know they're not ooh well did you have has name all over them no it was a a letter from a girlfriend of mine and i i just i was upset because those are mine and you know i thought he that was yours yeah right i thought he'd respect me more than that to look through my things and not trust me so that was upsetting i was mad about that my privacy there yeah yeah  the topic today is credit cards yeah bummer uh why don't you go ahead and tell me some uh some of your favorite uses for a credit card if if at all that's applies no because i don't have any okay i gave up all my credit cards when i got my first divorce it's uh well i wish i was in your shoes Pat i uh i was i was i was in pretty much control of my credit cards up until the point where we moved down here from South Dakota and then uh it took my wife and i about two months to find a job so in that interim everything went on the credit card oh yeah um and uh so now we're slowly trying to pay it off and if i would i just keep thinking if i would've just been able to take that money and put it in a savings account instead of paying bills right i'd be uh you know i'd i'd be doing all right today but no i've got those darn credit card bills hanging over my head yeah but that's still it still helps sometimes sometimes they help and sometimes they don't right you know i think if i had one i'd probably be maxed out well that uh that's uh always a possibility you know um because i'm not very what you call uh what's the word uh controllable okay my husband is but i'm definitely not one of them people okay well i uh while we were doing like i said we were doing all right you know we'd put gas occasionally go out to eat or pick up a small gift or something you know some clothes or something but and we could always pay it off when um-hum when the bill came and when we moved down here and everything was going on the credit card i think we we got a little rampant we you know went out to eat out everything and you know we'd we'd have to go to Wet and Wild and we had to basically play tourists the first yep the first month that we were here and of course everybody takes credit cards so um-hum why not it got uh it got way out of hand but thankfully we're we're now um-hum working to pay them off and and we haven't put anything on them in a couple months oh yeah it gets bad it can it sure can well what uh um what do you find are some of the best advantages of credit cards emergencies um-hum if you have one major credit card you can do anything during an emergency that's true other than that then you're more or less have to have money or uh some kind of way of getting some right right so that's probably you know the best thing i can think of the the bad thing is you get accustom to them that's right you can you certainly can you know so i don't know i had i was used to them and then when my me and my husband broke up and i had to pay all the bills that did it i huh-uh none i don't want any well i understand that you know you can't even rent a car hardly or uh with get an airplane ticket without a credit card without one that's right it's unless you got cash money right well even if you have cash it's hard to if you're under twenty five and you you have cash you still can't get still can't rent a car you have to have a credit card um-hum you can't rent a car no you can't rent a car yep um-hum and that uh i don't know i think the only thing that saves me there is you can rent a car through TI if i really had to rent a car okay you work with TI then okay well you don't even speaking of cash you don't get the five dollars for the phone call you just you get the gift part isn't that how that worked if you're a TI employee but other yeah yeah hum i get a little point and you get so many points and you get the little pick a little gift and that's about it well that's all right that's that's an interesting incentive we uh we wanted to do it because we weren't from the south and i think we would able we'd be able to meet more people or get to know get to know about Texas more or less yeah um-hum well not yeah exactly you know get get to i still have a hard time uh understanding some people's accent oh yeah you know i i can't i i just can't understand what they're saying what yeah some of them have some strong ones but yeah there are yeah i've only been here thirteen years so okay where are you originally from Los Angeles Los Angeles boy there's a change definitely i suppose it's not as cold there as it is here now no now i wish i was back so it's hot well what's life in LA like not good that's why i'm here uh-huh okay a lot of crime and oh very high seems to me you know i i couldn't understand why it would be such a heavily populated area if there's so much crime so much smog so much traffic because you can't people can't leave you can't just up and leave and not know where you're going i left because i was in the service so i didn't have you know i had a lot to i could leave okay  so what kind of a house do you live in uh i'm in a uh in a ranch a uh it was about uh sixteen hundred square feet when i bought it and uh it's about two thousand square feet now but it's one of those typical uh ranches that you find around here oh it's uh built in the probably built in the late fifties so it's not um what you would find uh uh where you live but uh for the older um ranch homes it's pretty typical i guess um-hum well our home is uh probably for our area it's probably one of the lower income homes out here um most of the the homes that they're building well i shouldn't say all of them but most of them now are up in the millions of dollars oh oh yeah there's really how many square feet do you have we have got about uh twenty i'd say about twenty four hundred four bedrooms um we've got five bedrooms because we built on to our garage a a bedroom for my mother five bedrooms uh-huh and uh i made a i made a fourth bedroom out of uh i i made a fourth bedroom out of one of our out of our living room and then added a uh what we call a sunroom to get the you know when we when we added four hundred square feet to our house oh oh that's great so yeah well this this house is very comfortable we've got two living areas and that that's the thing i probably like the most about it how many stories just one it's just one story yeah it's a Fox and Jacobs home how are they built um we've been real happy with it yeah i've heard the i've heard the construction's pretty good on Fox and Jacobs course i'm not a carpenter or anything like that they could probably come in and say gee this is not straight and this is under something that but i mean it doesn't give you trouble no no we haven't had a lot of problems with it at all uh-huh no cracked slab or anything like that no we've been real lucky um and is it um uh natural gas and so yeah uh you know what i miss though basements oh yeah i sure i sure wish they could build basements in homes in Texas yeah i i've heard a lot of people say that that's for sure uh we have an attic that we've just put you know plywood over over the beams and things up in the attic and so that um-hum um-hum so you has replaced it to some extent but certainly not can you stand up in it uh in parts i mean you couldn't you really couldn't use it for a room so you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here yes it's ours is pitched so shallow that you uh don't get much room in the attic yeah yeah we uh we've got you know i'll store all our Christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there so five bedrooms and two living two family things two living areas we have a living room and dining room at the front of the house and then we have a the uh family room kitchen and play room uh-huh uh-huh at the rear of the house which has been really nice in fact i really enjoy the playroom that you you would think that would not be a real bonus you know to a house but of all the rooms in the house i'd say that was that was the one that's been really nice to have isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time i think that's true yeah probably our family room's the the biggest uh you can right some people i mean families seem to migrate towards one one room and carry on most of their activities there and uh uh some rooms uh we have one room that we never use i mean might as well not even heat and cool it yeah yeah strange well that's kind of the way our living room dining room is but it is nice to have it because there's uh um-hum with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come just on the spur of the moment right right uh-huh so so you've been fairly happy with it how long have you been in it seventeen years wow boy it doesn't seem that long but it is because we uh came to this area about the same time uh-huh we've been fifteen fifteen years in the in the house that we're living in oh wow and we the the principal feature i like about ours is that it's pier and beam oh uh-huh yours is a slab i assume yes it is yeah ours is a pier and beam which has allowed me to go under it and do a whole lot of different things that i could not have done if it was slab i've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work that uh-huh by myself and saved a lot of money that i couldn't have done if the house was on a slab well that's interesting well but that's because it's so old it's uh thirty five thirty six years old when they used to build like that and uh yeah um-hum well my husband wouldn't do that anyway that's his that's his worst thing in i know he's not handy right life is to have to repair something i on the other hand seem um so do a lot too much of it and uh i've gotten good at it which in a in a way is bad because then you uh you start to take pleasure in it well uh that's great uh we just kind of save everything for when Al uh for for when his uh dad comes to visit and then um-hum he does all the repairing you know he does right my dad is actually uh  go ahead um i haven't given this a a lot of thought i'm uh i'd that's a whole pleased with the practice practice that is they i uh i don't you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand i'd say arguable that that that uh people who's jobs are critical to to public safety should have to meet special standards uh i haven't given this matter enough thought do you work for TI no uh uh i'm in the Washington area i work for NIST oh oh okay oh all right well see we have the testing already here we've had it for oh about five years it used to just be for new employees um-hum and now it's for all employees they uh randomly select employee numbers and uh the day that they select you is when you have to go and and be tested so we're familiar with it and now and how do people feel about it uh we have a lot of um people upset about it at the beginning some not all but what was happening at TI is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse um mainly the areas where where they were doing a lot of um manufacturing type things and what they ended up doing is um kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing you know on the premises well okay that's that's a very different issue well yeah it it was you know combination of of uh both activities and uh and using too so they developed this uh drug policy so that uh to eliminate there's some parts of the company that we do uh government contracts and i think some of those require the drug testing but now TI thought well we'll just do it for all employees that um not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in and that we shouldn't have um people on drugs within our you know offices and such i haven't personally ever been tested but i don't have a problem with it and um does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs no but one thing that to to me was um going on stretching it a little too far was that they also check um if you're taking somebody else's prescription drug you know it happens a lot of times like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever and you know then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the you know doctor and get another prescription hm well according to what they do at TI if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name it you know it can't be in your spouse's name so they will look i mean the testing will look for i guess any kind of drugs and you have to tell them what you're taking a prescription for so they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking right yes yes when you get tested you're supposed to tell them you know everything that that might be there and then if they ever um question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name okay well well i mean it's i would guess that in fact they don't test for for they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs but that i but they don't tell you in advance uh so well what they were be testing for are the ones that would have like you know barbiturates or codeine things like that in them the ones that would constitute controlled substances or something anyway right right i guess that's what is they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and antibiotics antibiotics and stuff they'd be looking for the yeah controlled things barbiturates amphetamines so what they're asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you're taking which are controlled substances right right you pretty much you know put down what you remember even if it is was just Contact or something like that but afterwards uh maybe if you had a controlled substance well you you probably put down you know you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it is Contact a what okay is Contact a no i'm just saying you probably probably put down on the sheet anything you have taken but if they had a controlled substance maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name substance okay okay i know i had one contract employee through manpower was not a TI person but was it contract person and they test them too even if you are not a real uh TIer if you are a contract employee here they test you too um-hum um-hum and he had taken some kind of um oh you know uh just he had some kind of flu or something he got a real bad migraine and he took his mother's  all right what's your favorite show well i was just trying to think when they called i didn't have as much time to prepare for this as i did some of the others um i love watching some of the uh new new shows basically um-hum and we uh took we subscribe to CNN and we took that and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during any kind of thing like the earthquake and i have gotten stuck on a lot of this the news shows and the stuff that comes on that that it you know like the uh at night the discussion talk shows and things and we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current um-hum uh especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here sure we have little ones uh we do let them watch 911 and we think that's kind of informative to teach them how to handle things in situations um-hum it really is um-hum what do you watch i watch just about anything but not a lot of TV i mean i'll watch you know maybe a little while when i first get home in the evening um-hum um-hum uh-huh and i usually watch you know the news and then i'll watch that Hard Copy or uh-huh that's the same things we do or that kind of thing you know and i like the 911 and Unsolved Mysteries and um-hum yeah that kind that's the kind i like really more than the sitcoms i haven't gotten into many of those um-hum now i do like my husband is really crazy about Evening Shade that comes on on Monday evening i have heard that's real good and i uh that's Burt Reynolds isn't it yeah i've heard that um-hum and i've got to where every Monday i rush around so i could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny now someone told me that and also uh i i meant to be trying to pick up on Murphy Brown because they said that that was really good this season um-hum well his favorite night's Monday night so we've got to where we'll sit and watch it on Monday night because that and then that uh oh i can't even think of the name of it you've got it uh-huh like i say i'm not Designing Women is on that night too yeah and the one with the the sergeant that married the woman with the kids Sergeant McGillis hm i don't even know Sergeant uh Major Major Dad oh okay now i we've never even seen that yeah that comes on right after uh the Evening Shade and then Murphy Brown and Designing Women uh-huh so we always he watches that and i kind of sit i watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others as i can on the other well you know on Friday nights especially we like to watch 20/20 or um it's kind of a competition on Thursdays between Prime Time and Knots Landing um-hum um-hum yeah but uh we used to like Knots Landing a lot oh excuse me just a minute the money's right there on the well you can't hardly watch Knots Landing with the little kids around though oh i know that's the thing and so we um-hum well they are in fact on weeknights they're in bed by eight but we've just gotten anymore to where we just keep it off except they's probably are in bed by nine did you get your pizza taken care of yeah he's gone to get it thank you um but i was but i was trying to say on Saturdays there's absolutely nothing and that's the day my husband wants to do straight sports well do you know i have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that i've really liked and that's Sisters have you watched that no but i saw that advertised today and it sounds like it's not fluff it sounds like it's good it's really you know it's really pretty good i mean it's kind of like you know um um-hum soap opera i guess yeah that's what they said it was kind of a little more drama to it but it's so so far it i've watched it about three times now and it's really held my attention it's been pretty good some pretty good acting well and and another one now that it's getting darker and you're wanting to cocoon more that they said is excellent is the I'll Fly Away and Brooklyn Bridge some of these that are nostalgic now i watched Brooklyn Bridge this week for the first time but i haven't i did i like it did you like it did you well they said that one and I'll Fly Away are really quality you know and i haven't seen it either i think what i need to do is kind of read to see what's on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then i get my bath it's you know it's almost too late to start something new now i haven't seen i'll Fly Away yet um-hum it's nearly too late for TV that's the way i am i get in from work and i'm tired and i sit and watch for a few minutes then i have to get up and do dinner and everything yeah yeah um-hum yeah and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for the weekend nights so it's like we kind of tuned out of our TV um-hum yeah that's us if we're home on the weekend we always watch videos so yeah well we do too but there are some good shows on i i really probably should watch more of them than i do but i like i don't know i i'm always in to making things and yeah i don't know yeah there's a lot more to do with with your time when you get into it and i don't just spend all my time and i my husband now he sits and watch TV constantly um-hum well my my sister and them and her husband do on weekends they don't have children yet and they just turn it on when they walk in they turn it off when they leave um-hum um-hum so they're used to that too i can be around here for hours by myself and never have it on yeah i understand same here but uh but there are some really good new shows that i have enjoyed and i'll have to watch that I'll Fly Away this week yeah it's real good and of course in the afternoons if i get in from work in time i watch Oprah some of those you know talk shows i like her okay yeah i never get in in time for any of those so yeah yeah well it's it's nice talking to you i guess we've kind of exhausted this one but it's nice talking with you well it's nice talking with you thank you bye-bye bye  um do you want to start yes on uh taking care of the elderly do you have an older relative that you are concerned with right now i just have one grandmother that's that's alive and i'm she's i think in her low eighties but she lives by herself and takes care of herself and stuff and she's healthy i see that's very important uh-huh i tell you i have uh faced this whole subject myself because my mother is not quite that old but um-hum she uh has Parkinson's and uh hm we tried taking care of her in the house and it got to where it wasn't safe and then uh um-hum um-hum we had to to uh try different things and finally she's in a nursing home hm did you hear they're coming closer to a cure for Parkinson's um i hope so uh-huh because it really is a bad disease because a lot of people in uh i think a country like Guam or something have it so um-hum um they're studying those people and coming closer to a cure well they know what causes it uh and you know it's a an insufficiency in the brain what um-hum i think it was it was on the news and they mentioned something like that some chemical yeah but uh so far they haven't uh that i know of they haven't figured out why there's a deficiency and um-hum the medicine they give them is supposed to replace it but it it doesn't um-hum it also has side affects um-hum how do you feel about having to place someone in a nursing home well i hope i can take care of my parents someday i hope i can afford to um-hum um um i guess it depends on what the nursing home's like because there's some very nice ones that i wouldn't mind checking into it myself hm well well and i think another part of it it depends on whether you are uh physically able to do it uh-huh to give them the care they need uh-huh that's true if you have to work you know you don't have a choice well and then too uh i found that even if i didn't work uh-huh i couldn't hold up to taking care of mother twenty four hours a day uh-huh uh-huh because it's hard work it just uh uh you know she couldn't do anything by herself and uh um-hum her mind wonders and she wonders um-hum and uh i've tried it on weekends and stuff and i my feeling on it um-hum is that the nursing home is there if you need it um-hum but you hope you don't need it um-hum and i think your health is important as important as theirs um-hum um have you ever thought about what uh kind of things you would look for in a nursing home if you ever had to choose well i guess just a nice caring environment for one thing um-hum and just cheery atmosphere um i've gone to this nursing home over on um Forest Lane and Greenville out there um yes um just for like field trips i'm a teacher and i take my students to nursing homes because um yeah good we study old age and stuff and um there's this one particular one over there that i've visited that was really nice and the director would hug the um-hum elderly people you know hello and um we the days we were there we played games with them and just real nice atmosphere real cheerful atmosphere and it's a gorgeous nursing home too um-hum um-hum that's good um they love the the older people love to be around children too um-hum and the kids i have to like drag them out of there too so isn't that great uh-huh i think it's mutual yeah that's great so like a grandparent or something uh-huh so um i don't know if i could course there's a um put my parents in a place like that i wouldn't feel bad um-hum you know well i think the worst worst thing about having to do it is the guilt you do feel um-hum and i think the first thing is you have to be absolutely sure that's what you need to do um-hum and uh i know in in my situation we had to consider nursing care and uh um-hum that's another thing medical the doctor available and the fact that it's clean and you also have to you have to uh pay attention to how much it costs too um-hum um yeah i bet because it can probably cost a fortune um-hum it it can and it costs more than most people make in a year hm but uh does insurance help cover it at all or there is a special insurance you can buy um-hum for nursing home insurance in fact my husband and i take it hm because we hope we never have to use it um-hum but uh it would uh take care of an interim period until you know if it was a long-term care until Medicaid would kick in um-hum do you have children or because Medicaid uh pardon do you have children yes i have four um-hum um-hum but uh so you have um plenty of people to take care of you some day well um  uh well i i i guess it's a subject i haven't thought too much about uh i don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools uh as much as we're expecting too much out of them uh that might be a lot to do with it i know a lot of it here in my state i'm from Mississippi i'm not sure where you're from Minnesota okay well a lot of it in Mississippi here is got to do with funding Minnesota Wisconsin yeah problems with our education system a lot of it's due money and they're trying to spend money where we don't have it and there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford um-hum yeah well it's it it is getting very expensive to run schools so they got computers now that you got to train on there's just so much uh more well it is right and less money to do it with that's true and a lot of it lot of it has to do with uh salaries too speaking of money because if you can't pay the right people you know they're not going to be able to do they're not not gonna get the people that can do a good job all right yeah yeah yeah i i i guess that in uh talking on lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools i i think they're expecting schools to discipline the kids and uh i think it should go right back to the parents if you don't train your kids right then right i feel the same right i feel the same way a lot's got to do with how the kids were raised at home right yeah and then when the kids get to school they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids i mean they've so severely severely severely limited what disciplinary action you can do yeah yeah i i know when i uh was going to school it it wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving i mean they do that now and they could probably lose their job exactly right lose their job and and big lawsuit and all that yeah yeah i feel that's got a lot to do with it people aren't as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be right right yeah uh seems uh a be a subject that i i don't have much to say on really we've we've talked some about it in my state because we've have a lot of uh problems well our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education but he wasn't yeah and a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly i know a lot a lot of if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better school system um-hum and unfortunately there's not many places to get that money yeah then if you don't have qualified teachers in the different subject areas i know one of my physics professors at college has has addressed this that most of the teachers at the um elementary and high school level aren't scientists they're teachers and they may not know a lot about what they're teaching where as they may have just had a teaching major um and then had some social studies courses and they're trying to teach social studies and they don't know a lot about that right where maybe a physics professor he my professor was a physics professor and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background in physics at the high school level so therefore they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view and that causes a lot of trouble right yeah i don't know maybe they should sit back and and kind of uh decide on where the money's best spent i know in lot of cases uh different districts like to have nice fancy schools right and maybe they should be a little more uh uh concerned with paying the right people to teach and and be uh satisfied with maybe a little older school exactly because i mean here in uh the county where i went to high school one of the the the four high schools in my county one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado so when they rebuilt that school they had a a top of the line high tech school there and the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties uh-huh and then when uh evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones telling them what they need to do to fix up this building and this and this and this and so it it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them yeah yeah well i i i know uh where i came from uh we didn't have a very uh rich community and uh high school that i went to was uh very old and um as far as uh i know it's still there they've expanded expanded on it but they've never build a new one and it's probably fifty sixty years old or or better right i don't foresee them uh building a new one for a long time because they can't afford it exactly that's  is that right right now what was your name again okay well well my name's Barry where do you golf at Barry okay well i don't uh much well actually hardly at all i um the only times that i've actually golfed is we we were uh going to a family reunion up in Maine every year and a bunch of the brother-in-laws and whatever else would go out and play like couple times during the week that we were all there um i've done that about three or four times i guess i see so you're from Maine originally then no i'm from uh uh New York New York but we've got my family my family my dad's family's from Maine well i'm originally from Nebraska and really didn't play much golf there until i moved to South Dakota and we lived on the golf course and i took up uh golf at that time and uh-huh really enjoyed it and uh then when we moved to Plano i really haven't had uh we've lived here a year now and i really haven't uh golfed a lot but those times that i have been out i went to the uh uh-huh uh Plano Municipal Golf Course and then i've golfed uh couple times uh at Chase Oaks um-hum and that's very challenging at Chase Oaks uh lot of water what's it cost to to play at at now oh if i go to the Municipal Course it's uh maybe twenty five dollars for eighteen holes and uh seems to me that when i was at Chase Oaks uh um-hum well of course i took my son with me so we were close to you know fifty dollars or so it's pretty expensive isn't it it really is yeah real expensive actually but uh i enjoy it probably uh it depends on which day i go uh um-hum as to which part is most challenging um-hum what do you shoot what do you shoot when you were playing oh probably uh for nine um i i i've felt pretty good with maybe a forty one forty two around in there well that's not bad at all i that would make you about eighty or eighty two for for eighteen that'd be a that'd be a darn good game for me yeah yeah but that's pretty that's pretty good shooting yeah i'm i'm happy with that yeah well what do you what do you uh what do you find attractive about playing golf well i think what i find attractive is when i can go out uh with friends and uh on a nice day just to be out uh and stay Jerry hold on a second Jerry she's about to get my cord uh oh baby we got a loose connection on this phone oh just uh i i guess the thing that i like most about it is getting away from work and uh a although uh if i am jogging or working out or playing golf or whatever it's a a time to get away from things but yet sometimes things become more a little more clearer that way too yeah well i i liked uh we i probably played maybe five or six times but we did that and uh but what i liked about it was i could i could uh i liked being outside um and of course the golf courses uh are are beautiful the one that we played at in Maine was real pretty and you could be with people and yet ooh ooh uh so you had nice you had company and stuff but then significant portions of the time you were off in an area of the course by yourself too which uh it was kind of um the best of both yeah yeah both worlds actually yeah that's nice i'm uh you know it it bothers me when uh especially in this particular area there are so many people that play golf that you tend to uh you have a lot of people there and feel hurried and i don't i don't like to feel rushed when i'm playing golf um-hum what's uh what's what do you do best on the golf course but oh you know it it really varies from day to day uh if i'm if i'm on i uh really can hit uh hit my driver pretty well is that right and uh that's that's a new experience for me because for about a year to two years uh i couldn't hit my driver i had such a hook that uh i would just use a three iron all the time and i could hit my three iron just about as far as anybody else could hit a driver so i used that but then i took a few lessons and really uh worked on it and um-hum oh you took lessons uh yeah we had a golf pro uh and i took maybe two or three lessons basically uh and uh had a golf pro and and uh it was like maybe twenty five dollars for a half an hour um-hum um-hum but uh he really helped a lot yeah do you own your own clubs i guess you probably do don't you yep yeah i uh uh got a pair of used clubs for a Christmas present one year and uh so before that i'd been using uh is that right my little sister's uh women's set and i thought boy the first day i got those uh new clubs i'd go out and uh really uh knock them dead and uh it takes a while to get used to a new set of clubs oh yeah hum my uh brother plays a lot like every weekend up in New Jersey is he pretty good golfer well you know yeah he shoots well he shoots eighties you know which which i think that's pretty good you know good we uh probably my the most exciting experience i had playing golf was over in Hawaii we took a vacation and uh my brother and i went out brother-in-law went out and uh uh um-hum played in uh  uh i guess i've always kind of liked golf i i worked on a golf course at at one time and that's how i picked up golf and uh i don't know it's just a kind of a challenging game it sure is i play at least three times a week um-hum i'm on it i haven't gotten the chance lately though to play i'm trying to get back into it uh so uh i got to start all over again it's not like riding a bicycle you do tend to forget no well i'm one of those rare left handed golfers oh yeah and i do enjoy playing what's your handicap right now it's three okay yeah i was down at about four or five quite awhile ago it's probably up there to twenty now if if i was ever to start again well if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down yeah yeah i got to try and get out there i i know with uh our long winters i i enjoy watching it i don't know if it's just because i like the game or i just like to to see the warm weather uh well we can usually play here year round sometimes in January it's not too comfortable to play um-hum but there's usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play and i'm pretty much addicted to golf so i get out there one way or the other yeah that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter you almost have to relearn every spring to to get back out it's a good game though it's very challenging and the reason i like it so much is because i'm essentially playing against myself yeah that's the way i look at it i i play in in lot a lot of groups and but i don't they keep score and between themselves but i really don't care um i go out and each shot i say well this is what i'm gonna try to do and then i see how close i can come to that um-hum right yeah you always work on trying to improve each day and yeah and inevitably inevitably one facet facet of my game isn't working at one time or another either i'm not driving very well or i'm not hitting long irons very well or i'm not putting well or but sometimes it all comes together yeah yeah i i know what you mean i when i used to golf out there i'd putt well but i i wouldn't uh chip well one of the two uh or something would go wrong but i always managed to to get near par anyway well we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst oh and i went to that and Craig Statler won in the play-offs um-hum but we uh this is a big golf area yeah we have a lot of uh i'd say we probably have within fifteen miles twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course Pine Hurst and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year um-hum do you have uh long waits uh to get on the course yes we do as a matter of fact it it uh it's only been that way in the last five years but now you uh most of the courses have a uh yeah two day advance tee time you have to call yeah okay yeah i just moved into this small community so i'm gonna try and get in one of their golf courses here and i'm hoping it won't be quite i was from the uh twin cities area that's some cold golf too isn't it yeah are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather we have cold yeah usually January and the first two weeks in February well i wish that's all we had but um last week we were in the seventies and something's coming through now so it's like in the low forties right now oh but uh it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties we have very windy winters hm and very cold yeah but we don't get any snow anymore i don't i don't know what changed that pattern we used to get four or five inches a year now we get nothing it's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall oh i see well at least it that doesn't uh get in the way of golfing so no but i have played golf in the snow before that yep get out my orange golf ball and go out and yeah yeah now that's what they do here sometimes you hear about it where they'll take the orange ball out there but if you got  all right what's what's the last thing you had done Bernie oh the last thing i had done or did let's see um was getting a an old seventy eight Jeep Cherokee ready to trade in uh-huh and uh so i was basically just going around and doing what i could do fixing door locks and checking the transfer case fluid and things like that i'm kind of a motor head myself so this topic's actually pretty good for me uh-huh huh um i got a seventy Chevelle that i'm restoring too so it's uh there's constant work going on to that car yeah so you do a lot of a lot of repairs for yourself yeah yeah yeah i didn't uh used to do too many repairs but i got we ended up with a real old uh car that kind of needed constant repair just to keep it running sure and um it got to be too expensive to take it in so i started uh i guess the first thing i did was replace the starter you know i did sparkplugs and things and and then i had it needed a starter so i replaced that needed a water pump so i replaced that uh-huh and uh just about a week or two ago i had to pick change an intake manifold gasket which was which for me is you know i mean i'm i'm forty i'd never done much auto repairs until about the last year or so so talking about taking the carburetor off and the oh wow uh-huh right i mean that's some that's some serious work not only uh i mean you have to have a yeah i mean you have to have a knowledge of quite a few of the the systems there to to do that what i mean that yeah yeah it was uh it was yeah well i didn't have i don't have much knowledge of the systems but i just kind of know you know i i make note of when i take a anything off and bet you can and uh so you know generally if you just kind of make make note of where everything goes as you're taking it off uh you can yeah have you tried any like the Chilton's uh manuals no huh how are they oh i i recommend recommend them i've uh used i uh i have a Chilton's manual on my Chevelle and every anytime i undertake anything it i start start with that that book uh-huh well does it tell you kind of a step-by-step how to type of thing oh it does huh yeah yeah yeah they're they're pretty good um the only problem i've noticed with them is that when i started working on cars i um yeah uh didn't really have much knowledge of them at all and and you know it's hard the language of motor automotive mechanics is a language all it's own and just the names of some of the parts you know they tell you to put the wrench on something and um-hum yeah yeah i have trouble with that trying to talk to people at parts shops shops now you know yeah you know and it took a while before you figure out what everything is and uh and what you are supposed to be doing with it but i i think it's a lot better than than starting from starting cold and that's for sure yeah yeah what kind of uh well you pretty well do everything no yeah yeah i used to uh pay to have tune-ups done and uh oh brake jobs and things and kind of had to do them on this old car and and uh uh-huh i i don't think i'd ever pay to have someone put plugs and and things in and the brake changing brake pads is that was easy oh i know brake job that was nothing that was nothing i you know i didn't have to bleed the lines down or anything but it looked like if you were just um it looked like in most cases you probably couldn't get air in those lines is is that right right well i i don't know i've get i've gotten the Chevelle i've did done the brakes all the way around it myself and uh yeah that was easy well this this one's got drum brakes though drum brakes drum brakes are a little bit tougher than disc brakes but um but still it's not anything that that okay tougher yeah you know it's just a matter of putting the parts in the right place and there isn't really anything you can do wrong to it um yeah yeah and those ones did have to have the lines bled though but but bleeding the lines is just a matter of uh you know just having somebody on the uh pumping the pedal the brake pedal for you and when it's they did yeah and you just open a a valve of some sort until till fluid comes out i guess yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah well that uh the disc brakes i mean that you know i i used to pay like sixty seventy dollars to have that done i spent spent ten bucks on pads sure yeah and it took a couple hours and they just they just snap in basically i mean it was it was uh it was easy yeah yeah there's no not not too much trick for that yeah they're uh buy i just this new vehicle i buy i just bought a ninety one GMC Sonoma which is a little pickup truck with a and i'm wondering when the time comes for the maintenance on this thing how much i'm gonna be able to do myself and yeah how much is going to require all their diagnostics and all that yeah it looks pretty simple i used to have an eighty five Chrysler Laser and this one certainly looks a lot more simple than than that motor um-hum but uh i haven't i haven't gotten into fuel injectors and things like that and that thing's fuel injected so i don't know what uh um yeah how that will will be the only thing i've ever done on a fuel injector is replace the hose on it it was leaking so i don't know huh i like the old cars open up the hood on my Chevelle and there's nothing under there but a big motor and uh and you know no  let me ask you do you think the Soviet Union is a still a threat to the United States do you know i don't know what to think i i the person i am i want to believe that it's an honest effort i want to believe that that they really are trying to change that that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society and i i want to believe it's all okay uh-huh but then there's that side of me that says yeah but they've put on faces before right and never to this extent though you know so so it's like there is a struggle within me going do do i be open minded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality you know i i trust people i'll do that uh-huh or do i keep on going well we'll wait and see well i think there's a a struggle within the Soviet Union um i think the people are are just fed up and i think it's showing in all the republics trying to gain their independence and i think uh that's making Gorbachev and others realize that hey maybe this Communist thing isn't working yeah that it's not just American uh or western society telling you it it's it doesn't work right you know they've always said you know the the Soviet people were united we believe this and maybe they're seeing that no no hey we don't believe this you know that's right i think but it's still you know i guess i keep that one part of me that's like well i don't know i want to trust them and i it's like i can't and maybe it's because you know we've had our own propaganda over the years i don't know well that that could be you know what i we always we think of the KGB and we think such bad things you know but i wouldn't doubt if the Soviet people think CIA and they think such bad things you know and they probably do the same things exactly exactly they do you think the CIA doesn't spy i'm sure they do oh yeah they do you know now the difference is we don't i don't i don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe you know i think to that extent we don't go as far but i'm sure they lie you know oh yeah oh absolutely that's part of that propaganda thing and i think if we can get away from that or if we can keep that out of our minds ah excuse me i've got a cold today so that's all right i hope you get better thank you um i think if we can get that propaganda thing because i'm sure both countries are seeing seeing it you know thinking KGB and CIA and all that but uh yeah just on an economic point of view if the Soviet Union doesn't do something fast they're they ain't gonna be able to feed their people this this winter you know but yeah yeah that's true but on the other hand i'm kind of getting fed up with uh our own country and presidency ah always concerning themselves with other nations' problems when we have so many at home yet and i'm not against them being concerned but i feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own right you know i mean you know any any country that wants to be democratic i'm all for helping them you know because i i understand that you know you're looking at United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government right but at the same time i agree i don't think we can do it and and just you know turn our backs or or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here that's right you know we've got uh we've got quite a few domestic problems that uh that i feel we ought to be concentrating more on i think the problem is and on the international scope maybe the president feels that uh you know for long term relations with all these countries it's important and well we'll always we'll always have the United States and you know we need to solve these international problems but um i've think i heard in the news about last week sometime that uh the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on them on a domestic issue because the American public's kind of getting fed up with it yeah we we we believe in what he's doing abroad but but like you said there's issues here too right and but i i am encouraged by what's happening in the Soviet Union i'm encouraged by what's happened in you know the the iron curtain countries you know in in that block and right and i think it's moved in the right direction i now i think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight you know it's not going to it didn't happen here overnight and it didn't happen here without a struggle yep no that's right that's right you know and i i think sometimes we forget that but i i i'd i have to say yes i'm you know i'm encouraged by the way it's going uh well i think uh uh i think in the long  well you go first you called okay uh let's see um well i'm about forty years old so i was um right at draft age back back when uh when that was all going on right right and uh so that pretty it very much affected me as you know as far as being very impressionable right at that time um i i didn't think i was kind of kind of a caught up in the in the hippie movement back then and i didn't think it was uh worthwhile or or right then and i'm not any i'm not like you know i'm not a not that way anymore but i still don't think it was uh yes uh i still have a lot of questions about why we were there and and uh the way it was conducted and all kinds of things right yeah how about yourself well i'm i'm i'll be forty two in February in fact my husband was in the first lottery you know he he was in the first so you first lottery and uh he got a high draft number thank goodness so he didn't have to go but i never was for it either i um uh-huh um-hum i don't know i just felt it was a real political thing that i don't really think ever got us anywhere you know i don't i don't feel that we yeah that we accomplished much i think maybe i i don't know i i want to say well maybe if we'd gone into really win it but then i i i'm much more of dove than that so i don't know that i would have even liked that i just felt that it it drug on so long and yeah at such tremendous cost um and i think it was hard for people to keep up good morale in a situation like that i mean i i can't imagine what it was like for the men fighting over there i think that must have been a really hard thing to um yeah you know to to keep their morale up uh when they knew that we weren't really trying to win and and all of that so i never was really for it i mean uh yeah yeah um-hum well i was in the uh last lottery oh you were yep and i was i came out number two hundred and fifty one oh and i had been and they and uh they only took up two hundred that year uh-huh and i had been uh in in ROTC too uh so i would at least have a choice about what i was going to do uh-huh and when i came up two hundred and fifty one i went that's it i dropped out of ROTC and and uh yeah yeah uh yeah i i don't uh i guess uh i i kind of do the same thing i kind of think well you know i mean if if at least if we had weren't going all out to win it maybe it would have been worth something but then again i i uh probably too much of a dub my self to really well right i i don't necessarily like that philosophy but i think i would have liked that better than what we did yeah what we did yeah because all we had is uh what ten thirteen years and fifty six thousand people and and and we uh i don't know that we did we accomplish anything at all exactly i i i don't think so i mean uh i mean the communists got it anyway and and it's still such a mess in that part of the country today you know it's not like you know i think if things had been resolved and that was in a better situation but i don't think that's true and uh yeah yeah so uh you know i'm not sure that we really accomplished much of anything yeah so i don't know and and i still think we're paying for that i think that there are you know a lot of the men just suffered so terribly in that situation um um-hum so i i don't know i i'm glad i never i didn't have anybody well i had one person close to me that went but that's all i didn't know a lot of people that went did you did you yeah i didn't know anyone that that i can recall that went that which is uh now i've met some i've met some after the fact you know people that i worked with and stuff that had been several actually that i worked with that had been but i didn't know i no one that i grew up with well i had one person and he was in the infantry and he was little and what he did was he went into the tunnels uh no you're kidding no and he came back he he lived through it which is just amazing and he would not talk um talk about it much at all huh yeah he he just would not discuss it um he did tell us one time about seeing someone a a a kid about his age you know he was probably twenty i think and he came up upon a a Vietnamese and they both had their guns on each other and they just looked at each other and put their guns down and walked away hm very sensible i i thought so too and uh yeah what what part of the country were you in when all that was going on i'm from Phoenix Arizona okay so i was in Phoenix where were you i was in uh i'm from New York but i was in uh uh Fort Worth oh you came out here to go to school yeah so i was kind of in and i was you know there were there were about twenty hippies on the whole campus i went to TCU and there were there were about twenty hippies on the whole campus and we we were yeah yeah we were very much minority so it was kind of it wasn't like being up in uh Kent State with uh with uh ten thousand protestors that were that were oh well i was in Arizona State and i can remember um coming out i had gone into a restaurant to eat and coming out and there were about oh i don't know how many thousands of students coming down the the street they had completely cordoned off the street and you know there was lots of protesting going on there at the time so i um-hum  uh i guess it's uh watching the radio the TV today there had a lot of stuff on on uh crime in our state right now uh recently they've had a lot of uh uh the rapists uh murder type uh killers going around and oh gracious and well i i they've caught them and they they're in there uh-huh wasn't it your state that had the um guy that committed all those murders there was that um uh well yeah Wisconsin uh and Milwaukee area yeah yeah yeah that was really on the national news a lot we heard a lot about that in Texas yeah no that's well i i live right on the border Minnesota and Wisconsin so i kind of get both both news and i know in Minnesota uh they had uh the one that just uh got out and went after a uh college student and raped and killed her and oh they're not too happy about that now well i can imagine it seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me i i don't know i don't know if statistically they are but it seems like you sure hear a maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news i don't know yeah uh that's hard to say for sure i uh sometimes i wonder if these people aren't don't it just for the publicity and you wonder about that sometimes they they get their names in the in the paper and they become big celebrities um-hum that's kind of scary i'd i'm wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas well uh i know one thing i i think Texas has the death penalty right yes we do do you have it up there yeah no i see see i i not do you think that's a deterrent yeah well uh it's it's it's not gonna prevent any people from doing it but the person that's caught he'll never do it again if he gets the death penalty and that's and there are a lot of repeaters uh yeah um-hum i guess that's another thing that to me is a a real problem and i know we've got so many people in our prison system now at least here in Texas yeah i mean they're really in a crisis there's been times they've had to just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them and yeah a lot of them they put out on parole and then some of the ones that they put out early you know do repeat offenses and the crime rate's the worst than ever before hum yeah well some i'm just wondering a lot of times they'll put uh people lesser crimes in uh with uh people that did more severe crimes and they maybe they just tend to learn from these people and they and when they get back out they just go into worse crimes and i think that could be true too maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more um i think the whole parole thing you know if somebody's convicted of second degree murder or something gets fifteen years well they're out in six or seven you know outbound on the streets again yeah and to me that's really scary some some of these crimes that they commit you know seems like the punishment's not really equal to the crime well uh i don't know uh with with my limited uh psychology background i do have uh i don't i don't even feel that prisons and stuff are are the answer if you wanna stop the crime i think you got to get uh the people when they're kids oh yeah a lot of this probably just starts with from the from the homes also from the the the media the TV you see uh um-hum all these uh gory movies on there becomes uh just natural fact of life um-hum i think it's okay thing to do yep yeah i think that's a very good point you know i there's a lot more working mothers a lot more kids in day care centers all that kind of thing morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore uh-huh well a lot of the European countries uh they tend to censor well they probably won't censor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent and um-hum and they have a lot less crime hum some of some of those European countries are are you can leave your your uh doors open and and and be safe uh even uh i think New Zealand is one of one of the places uh that's not  seem to have the topic already on top of the tip of your tongue there so why don't you go ahead and start yeah isn't the uh the subject auto repair for tonight yeah that's great yes sir reason i say that is pretty timely because just tonight i went out and changed the oil in my car and that's something i like to do and uh something i okay something i can do with now the sophisticated auto cars we have today with all the computers and everything right exactly it's uh and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car but i do like to get out and tinker with a car and it's something i can do still do you enjoy working with your car i sure do i uh in fact the last thing i have i've done i can't i don't even remember what it is i've had to have oil changes done myself because i live in an apartment complex where we're not allowed to work on our vehicle we can't even wash our vehicle so oh dear oh that's too bad uh but the last thing i can remember doing where i had a sixty six Mustang and that was all right because like you said that was pretechnology days i guess ooh oh yes and uh you know you could do a lot of it yourself still and uh i didn't tinker too much with the engine it was it was in pretty good shape but my main concern and what i enjoy doing was was the interior and uh it was it was pretty shelled uh but it was fun it taking the whole thing you know the whole interior apart and ordering new carpeting and oh uh and did you install all that yourself right and well that was i bet that was a lot of fun it it was i my wife enjoyed uh she you know helped out a little we sanded down the the insides of the door panels um-hum and painted those and wow do you still have the car no i sold it well that's too bad A sixty seven Chevrolet uh Mustang is about the uh top top year for the Mustang car yeah it was fun though it was fun i i really enjoyed it and i was surprised at at uh the availability of parts yet yes you know you can you can still get factory original parts hm but uh you pay a premium but you just don't get them i i didn't i went ahead and got you you know Japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made Canada you know prefabs and all that stuff but yeah well it you know that's that's fine i i don't think that there would be uh you know a a quality difference i don't know you wouldn't you didn't notice the difference did you well actually there was oh and uh i had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate certain patterns uh exactly um-hum and so like the the glove box was just a little little wider little harder to fit in and the carpeting uh oh dear um-hum stretched a little too far i had to cut some of the sides down oh dear but just just little things you know one of the screws on on the door regulator uh window regulators you could get three of the three of the four to lineup the fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did oh i bet that was frustrating wasn't it you know thing oh it was but the end result is after you put your your panels on nobody sees that you got one screw missing in your your window regulator anyway and it it runs it works just the same so right right yeah that's that's true well you know that that is something i really enjoy doing um working on our car too the uh i just changed my oil oil tonight but uh i enjoy also working on things like the brakes and uh in fact just two weeks ago i helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car and uh either if it's a drum or or disc brakes i enjoy working on those kind of things disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem but i i honestly i don't have the tools for the drum i know you got uh certain spring lever that you got to have or some uh some spring pulley or something that you got to pull that spring back over onto that notch yeah spoons and yes you do uh my dad's got all that and and i i helped him when i was growing up but i don't have that stuff now comes to drum brakes i um-hum yeah you know don't have any choice but to take them in yeah that's true and you know it it doesn't doesn't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too because um i was helping my neighbor out and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced and i don't have of course the equipment to do that so he took it into a shop and had it resurfaced uh resurfaced and and fixed that way but yeah it is true uh you know sure i did have a sixty four Ford truck that i wish i still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around with it and work with it because you didn't have all the extra extra stuff that's in there now uh-huh i'll tell you what the other the nicest thing about them is uh everything was standard you didn't have to worry about finding a metric anything oh yeah boy i tell you and you know  okay do you work yes i do i think that's the main change what do you think well i think that's a big part of it and i i think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home and i almost think with our society and and inflation and the cost of things it's anymore it's almost couples have to work outside the home one right that's right but but yeah i think that's a big change i'd like to not work what about you well i've worked all the time up until just about a year ago yeah and i just uh physically i wasn't able to and i mean i love my job but i have four children and that's real hard you have children i assume so um-hum yes i have two and that's been a big deciding factor because i mean i never wanted to be a career woman but as long as i was was you know was going to work i was going to do as as much as i could as well as i could etcetera and right right right i i wanted to stay home when i had kids well i have two i have a four year old and a three year old and we would like two more but i it's like we talked uh i don't want two more unless i can quit and stay home and take care of them which is something right now financially it takes both people to work oh right oh it's real hard it's real hard i mean even i yeah it's full time work yeah it was so hard for me to work full time course my kids are are a little older but then you then you give up the money you know um-hum yeah you do there's saying course you know everything you give up something but i just i the kids are so wonderful but i do think that's one of the major changes you know my mom i remember her being home yeah that's yep uh you know she made breakfast in the morning for us and if she worked it was part time and it was work that was done while we were at maybe at school and she was there when we got home you know and fine yep i know yeah well i've decided now in fact i'm just i'm substitute teachers aid which is a a far cry from my travel agent career you which i loved uh-huh but i'm i'm there in the same school as my children my two littler ones um-hum and i'm home when they're home in fact i've had an offer to just work the Christmas season at a local jewelry store and i'm just really hesitating because i've i enjoyed my the first summer home ever spent seventeen years with my kids yeah oh oh i mean where i didn't have babies or day care or working as a travel agent and it was wonderful my kids and i we just had a ball course their their ages they're seventeen almost seventeen fifteen almost well sixteen fourteen eleven and nine and we're just running every direction and yeah see and i think oh oh but see it's such an important time to be home it is yes you know and that was important to me an that's my you know my husband was raised uh his his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked and he's like well you know what's the big deal about being home for your kids always were what yeah well as our kids are getting older you know he sees it more i said Russ you don't understand what it was like to have her home or to if you needed mom at school you know she was there to help or she was there to take you and you and and i want to be able to do those things so right right i think that you know it's good you know sometimes i'll have the cookies ready when they come home and and a lot of my boys uh my older boys' junior high friends will come over in fact everyday i've got boys hanging around yeah and it's wonderful i'm real close to the schools and you know we're just i i'm very happy to be staying home i think that's wonderful so where do you see us changing in the future but again i miss the money i don't i working well see that was one of the things she the the question i think is you know what changes do we see and i'm i'm not sure i i see it going anywhere i think they're still gonna have to work right that we are because it's so expensive if we want the extra clothes the extra car the extra thing is when a woman does work right then there's the clothes to buy and then there's the gas and then there's the lunches and then the day care you must pay a fortune in day care yeah um-hum um-hum the day care eats me alive you know i pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty a month for two kids they'd eat you alive oh my gosh yeah for two it's almost hardly worth it for you to work till they get in school then you work summers unless you're a teacher are you a teacher i know you no i'm not and i would love you you you talked about having the summers off and i thought oh that would be so wonderful and i love the little preschool they are in it's wonderful you know so i feel good about them being there but it's still not the same huh um-hum no it's not the same it's just not i i don't see things changing really and and it's terrible for divorced women um-hum you know who are forced to work who maybe don't have a college education thank goodness i have mine and i could get a real good paying job if i wanted to you know do in fact i still have offers you know please come back and we'll pay you this um-hum hm please come back to work sure yeah yeah and it's been a real tough decision but i'm very happy to be here with my kids my kids we've seen a remarkable difference in now that i'm home that's wonderful that's wonderful yeah i'm real and i'm but i've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis yeah yeah i know well i like that well we're working on it i'm hoping in about three to five years i'll be able to stay home and my kids of course will be in school then but i'll be there mornings i'll be there noons i'll be there afternoons and all i feel like that's good and i can work part days in my husband's business you know so that right yeah well oh that'd be great right i think the the other thing that that has changed for women because we are working is we're having less children he can afford for us to do that you know  now then what is your idea on what to serve for a dinner party um i don't know i i i personally don't throw a lot of dinner parties per se um well if you were just gonna have company what would um generally if i'm gonna have company something fairly easy for me to fix you know nobody wants to go to too much work um probably say it you know if it's more than say four or five people probably a like a a a fish dish or something or or a a pasta pasta dish well what kind of pasta what pasta dishes what is your specialty in pasta um generally uh the homemade pasta the wide whatever they call that stuff the wider homemade pastas do you yeah do you make your own yes ooh that must be interesting yeah it uh it's fairly easy you just make the dough in the old Cuisinart and roll it out and there's there's a we've got a special machine that you you roll it out and then it cuts it also and hang it over the drying rack okay do you ever um since we're coming into the holiday season do you ever do desserts um actually about the only dessert i i generally fix is some form of pie or a buttermilk pound cake i those the only kind of desserts i really like messing with anything anything more difficult than that is is generally a pain to me i i just don't like to take that much time and stand around and do it do you um do you care for the fruitcake no not at all i i i can i i can stand about a piece a year one piece of it a year but i i don't like to just eat it it's okay i have come upon a recipe several years ago that is the now i don't care for fruitcake period um-hum yeah and this one is absolutely it's so easy and it is so wonderful everyone i serve it to that does not even care for fruitcake wants the recipe uh it's it's it's kind of funny i i don't think i've ever met anybody that actually likes fruitcake oh my older daughter does oh she just thinks it's wonderful and we always provided her with with one but this is one can of Eagle Brand yeah a pound of nuts a pound of cherries uh candied cherries and a pound of something else in the candied fruits uh-huh mix that up put it in spray a pan loaf pan pour it into the pan and cook it at two hundred and twenty five degrees yeah for about about an hour and it's it is wonderful hm that doesn't have all that citrine in it and i think that is what the uh people are so opposed to with with the fruitcake yeah but maybe sometime when you have nothing better to do you would like to try that one okay so what more need we talk about this morning um i can't hardly think of much have you enjoyed this um switchboard conversations or is this your first one i've i've done several of them it's it's it's all right it's you know it's not like anything anything disastrous or you don't have to go to a lot of trouble to do it no that the way i feel about it and i have talked with some very interesting people so i hope you have a wonderful holiday both of them and um take care okay thank you bye-bye thank you bye-bye  well Sid have you established what kind of requirements you're looking for for your next vehicle well i don't know if i really have a a lot of uh requirements uh i guess i look at uh getting the best deal uh as as my main objectives normally whoever is willing to deal and and give me a good price okay well i i tend to be more methodical i guess uh i determine first of all what i'm gonna use the vehicle for whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a a personal mover uh where it's gonna be driven you know what types of uh driving i'm going to be doing on it primarily highway or or local mileage more often and uh hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that i tend to drive cars for about ten years at a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles um-hum so i'm i'm real picky if if if you're gonna keep something that long you know you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that you're you're gonna like for a long time yeah i don't know i've had pretty good luck you know even if if you take any car and and you care for it well enough uh you're gonna get some good life out of it uh i my Oldsmobile right now that i have uh is getting near eighty thousand and still in pretty good shape uh there was a flaw in there where a where a head gasket bolt broke and it cost me some bucks to to fix that but that was you know something that was unforeseen but i still think i can i'm gonna get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it sure well it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways a also then well i i drive like the song says the little old lady but uh but not from Pasadena but uh yeah i i baby them ah as much as i possibly can it's a pretty big expense nowadays uh and i guess i like to take care of it uh so i don't have to buy one too often that's true uh do you have more than one one than one vehicle in your fleet uh do you have a family fleet or yeah i i i got an old uh seventy six uh Grand Fury that uh doesn't wanna die on me so i i just keep running the thing don't wanna sell it or get rid of it until it it quits but it just doesn't seem to want to i'll probably have uh three four hundred thousand before it wants to die well that may be they Chrysler made some really good old engines back then like the the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine it's got the big three sixty in there gas guzzler but it runs good yeah at the moment i've got a Cadillac Cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a uh reasonably new Plymouth Voyager it's only a a couple of years old but that's the second one of of those that we've had that's the the family travel vehicle you know not only does it do all the the uh carpooling around during the week but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in i think that what i'm getting ready to get next is probably a Suburban unless they drastically change the the vehicle a lot uh i'm just getting tired of when i do get hung up in traffic not being able to determine what the problem is and and come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit that kind of stuff just because i can't see yeah yeah i'm too my Cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that i can't see past any vehicle that's in front of me yeah yeah well i i'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle uh i just have so many hauling projects a lot of times and uh uh i'd like to just start doing some uh uh carpentry uh type work around and i just feel that  well i don't know what to do about the federal budget um there certainly been ideas surfaced uh recently um matter of fact repeatedly by many people and i sort of wonder what your what thoughts you had on that area what the uh the first one is we need people in there that that understand uh numbers and the numbers that are being thrown around when when we're talking in trillions of dollars um-hum uh which is an astronomical sum and and the people that are talking these numbers have no concept of what that number means um now are you are you talking about the elected people or are you talking about others um-hum the elected people yes um-hum our our our Senate and Congress and and people that that deal everyday and and what's going to be done with those monies yes um and don't really understand what that is or how a budget even works um-hum uh we need to elect people that are more uh or i'm not sure how you would achieve how would you achieve that i mean if well let's let's make them have a degree in economy uh or economics uh so you would trust the decision making economists you you well sometimes called the dismal science yeah but but people people that that know the value of a dollar that understand the value of a dollar uh-huh yes um when in in in the the uh lobbyists needs to be eliminated um-hum um-hum uh from Congress um yes they don't make pragmatic decisions they make a decision based on constituency constituency yes instead of a decision based on what they really believe um-hum um you know the the or or they tack on these uh pork bellies and and do things that that are good for their area to pass something that is that is not good for the country right so so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists i mean right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say oh i definitely i definitely would yeah get rid of them love that make them all no causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for totally uh i i think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund should be able to do that um-hum and be registered with what they ever contribute contribute but they should not have a one-on-one relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them um-hum that that's a conflict of interest as far as i'm concerned yeah when you're talking again uh billions and trillions of dollars um-hum uh you're you're you're jeopardizing the future of the country uh for today and that so uh you talk about jeopardizing the future would you be against any deficit spending i i think to bring it in line you're going to have to have a generation that's going to really bite the bullet to bring it in line you can't ease into it it took years and years to build up the momentum that's there now um-hum uh i i i forget the figures on the interest rate but it's something like uh hundreds of thousands of dollars a second um-hum in interest part of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves we we buy from intimate international banking that's why we have interest yeah um-hum and and i i really i really feel that that that is part of the problem that we we've let things get so out of control that that we don't wanna put the brakes on them but what what practical steps could one could one take um by by having a a a budget that is is feasible that is reasonable well but everybody will say that he is for that oh of course yeah uh and and and how will you make that actually happen and then add on to it you take the gross national income um-hum and you say our budget is X number of percent of this gross national income one thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax um-hum across the board everyone no matter what pays a ten percent income tax yep sounds like a good idea nothing escapes right no no deductions nothing just ten percent uh that's right right no deductions you pay a ten percent income tax that's what you pay if you make forty million dollars uh then you're going to pay four million if if you make forty dollars you're going to pay four dollars yep right and and that's it yep so that that's it that's i mean i i agree with that that's a good idea idea and is it your expectation that that would raise the total revenues collected or or lower them or what and i don't know that it that it would or wouldn't  okay have you been able to enjoy some family reunions in the past that you'd like to discuss or um yes i have a very large family i have seven brothers and sisters wow that's a that's great and being next to the youngest we all have almost all are married and all have children so it's quite a feat to get everyone together but um-hum i imagine it would be with seven seven brothers and sisters um what we did one year was for my father's seventy fifth birthday we oh how nice we went out to dinner of course and we had cake and champagne and then we went back to his house and we reenacted some of the things we remembered him doing when he was when we were little oh okay you know like we always had to take off his shoes and socks so you know one of us did that and uh-huh and he used to tease us about he would he was gonna clean his shotgun when out on the front porch when we were gonna go out on dates or uh-huh he was gonna threaten to kill the um Easter Bunny or Santa Claus you know oh dear oh dear and so one of us dressed up and and got the old shotgun and you know course it was empty nobody uses it but brought that upstairs and i hope so not and so it was really funny he really enjoyed it and and all the rest of us did too because we spent a couple hours talking about it afterwards and adding more things we'd forgotten so uh-huh i'll bet he really enjoyed that was really yeah he did well that's fantastic that's fantastic did and how about you well we uh we're all scattered around the country i have a brother in Chicago one in Cleveland i have two in Germany and my sister we're from a large family also my sister's pretty close to my parents and uh my wife and i luckily came from the same hometown oh and her her family is scattered all over also so what we try an to do when we have family reunions we schedule at the same time every year uh-huh and we all kind of migrate back to where Mom and Dad are from which is in uh northern Utah and uh-huh so we kind of make sure that we schedule it the same time and we all head back about that same time and things that we do to make it memorable are that we go to a a resort either go water skiing horseback riding we make it a a week long affair and uh have a real nice vacation another reunion we do is uh at Christmas time this is something that a tradition that my grandparents started and we all get together around Christmas time the first Saturday the Saturday right before Christmas unless it's either Christmas Eve or a day or two before and that's uh the week prior to that and uh the amazing thing is we've had the same Santa Claus and his wife have come for the last twenty six years oh boy and so you know growing up as a kid that was always Santa Claus and he was the same Santa Claus year after year after year and it really made a very very pleasant and memorable and we all exchanged gifts as as family and and we got to a point where we're all growing growing up and we decided to have white elephant so excuse me i think one of the the main thing is just being able to get together and coordinate everyone's schedule oh that uh i find somewhat frustrating and and hectic but as long as we've uh announced it ahead of time and sent out flyers and and let everyone know when we're going to get together and what we'll be doing it's it's always been very very fun and i've always enjoyed it and uh we're very family oriented people and uh that uh makes it more special or more interesting especially when you have family from you know scattered all over the world when you can get together and discuss how their lives are and the different parts of the country too uh-huh oh i think that's wonderful my family is all over the United States as well and we are not as fortunate as to be able to get together even once a year so uh-huh i i moved here about eleven months ago and this is the closest i've been to most of my family for years i hadn't seen my sister in Austin for five years wow so i know it's really awful because we were mostly there are six girls and two boys in my family and so naturally we got then all got moved off somewhere wow yes yes well we're i think it's wonderful you get together once a year it's it's not always easy but it's uh it's very memorable memorable boy i bet that's hard because i imagine that as a large family you were very close and and uh had a lot of fun as family yes we really did we grew up on a farm and so you had to play with each other because there was no one else around so we played and fought and everything so oh yes so you got to  so who's your favorite team my favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers Pittsburgh i used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when i was little you bet well i um when John Stallworth played he was from my hometown in Alabama so i kind of grabbed on to that team oh really huh that's pretty nice way back when that's good i used i used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain or steel curtain that's right how about your favorite team hm well last year it was Buffalo and i i still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just they just impressed me as being so efficient and they never score they never blow out their opponents they just score just enough points and that really impressed me but i've been down here i live Laural is pretty close to New Orleans and i've been keeping up with the Saints a lot um-hum well they're exciting aren't they yeah the Saints are starting to impress me this year you know a lot boy they are they are just a fun team to watch this it they are really did you see the game Sunday night or Sunday afternoon um no i didn't it was funny they were they had uh a fireworks display at halftime oh yeah yeah and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire oh you're kidding oh my God so they had to stop the game in the middle of the third quarter and put out this fire there was a big piece of something came flaming falling out of the roof landed on the field so there was at big fire on the field and they were dumping the Gatorade bucket and everything oh i can't believe that it was funny i mean you just really can't tell what's gonna happen that's hilarious i know it's like about two weeks ago i was watching the Saints and Morton Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal um-hum oh and it it was beautiful right down the middle uh boy he is tough he has a incredible leg he is he is what do you think they're they're gonna be able to make it this year uh i sure past the first play-off game i sure hope so i'm not sure i'm not sure who they play right now i've got it narrowed down to the top four teams who's that it's pretty much going between Washington they're undefeated and uh Buffalo New Orleans and Chicago because Chicago's only lost twice and one of those was to Buffalo right and they beat the Saints their only time they lost what do you think about uh Houston Houston i saw Houston play this summer in Memphis oh yeah yeah uh from what i saw they were playing when i was at the game we sat right on the front row right behind the Houston Oilers uh and from what i saw the game Houston looked Houston impressed me a lot but my brother watched it on TV and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night and if that was an off night i'd hate to see what his uh good night hm oh yeah he's um-hum he's hm he definitely uh is one of the best i think yeah the their their backfield is really impressive hm Haywood Jeffries and Drew Hill and Allen Pinkett they really impress me right well they squeaked out a game on Sunday and that's right who who did they play they played Dallas uh they won in overtime Dallas that's right i was because that's right i remember that now so that was i i watched that game and uh that was uh do you have a favorite between those two well because i'm right here in Dallas i i kind of pull for Dallas really they yeah well also Houston is uh in Pittsburgh's division so i'll almost always root against them well that's true that's what i hate to say it but i hate Dallas i do that's okay well i you know i i was never really a big Dallas fan until we moved here and they just kind of grew on me yeah yeah i imagine that's the way i've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two and they've they've actually started doing something yeah yeah so i've actually paid paid attention to them um well well do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in to tell you the truth i haven't paid too much attention to that um what cities are they looking at really uh right now i think this Memphis they're they're trying to get a team and that's that's where i was when i saw uh Houston play um-hum uh-huh Saint Louis is trying to get a team uh Baltimore is trying to get a team and there's some other city i'm wanting to say Raleigh Durham but i'm not sure you know i think you're right i think it is Raleigh think so i think i remember hearing that um-hum because i i know they've got a world league football team but i think it might be them that'd be fun i'd like to see some more teams get in i would definitely i think they're supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after and right now i think Memphis and it's Memphis and i think Baltimore have a really good shot at it um-hum because i know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis and when i went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did oh really yeah it's like the Liberty Bowl or Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixty two  i um think that's one of the greatest concerns that uh is in our nation today is the crime problem what do you think oh yeah well yeah there's a host a lot of things that center around that crime area uh you know from um-hum from just uh people trying to make a living on the wrong side of the law to those who are just trying to uh keep their drug habit up and uh um-hum so i think that it encompasses a whole lot of the concerns i know in the large cities uh um we think that we have more crime but we have a place out in the country and uh we've had more more people break into our place in the country than we have in town oh really and so i don't know that it's confined just to the large cities uh-huh but uh we found that the crime rate in the country increased when they had let loose some uh early parolees and uh that concerned me because i was hoping letting the people out of prison early on for good behavior would work but i about decided it didn't um-hum but um yeah i i just don't know what kind of criteria they have used for most of those early parole leases releases so uh i think sometimes it it depends on what space they need that's right i think you're right yeah i'm sure it has a lot to do with it do you think that that has as much to do with the rising crime rate as uh the uh beginning of the of the gangs and things well i think um certainly that might have something to do with it but i also think that the standards of uh what we consider normal are is drastically changing each generation at least if not faster by because of the movies that are out there oh yes and what all the kids are exposed to and also the grown-ups out there that we're just constantly watching and what we would of normally you know used to consider awful is almost a normal kind of thing on TV now and i see what you mean yeah and i so i think that it's uh and also i think uh the way our lives our families are are uh being raised that with a lot more single families or a lot more full-time working families that uh um-hum there are a lot more strangers out there taking care of our kids and i i mean strangers in the sense of not the close family knit types that they used to have um-hum and um i felt so i think there's a lot more people growing up confused and feeling not really considering uh you know necessarily as wanted or loved as they might have felt uh had the family been a little closer-knit um-hum or maybe don't feel as responsible to anyone for their actions that's that's right that's a good good way to say uh to say it um-hum well do you think that uh with the recession that everyone says is coming along and more women don't find work and have to stay home and the economy goes down do you think that would help um deter the crime raise and and increase raising of families well i think it would be a long term change i don't think that we will see it too soon i think it'll um-hum not change i don't think it will slow down for quite some time just because there's you know it's gonna take that pendulum a long time to swing back the other way um-hum well i see an awful lot of working parents who very very involved in their children that's true and um i don't know i know it's hard especially to monitor television if you're not around um-hum but uh oh yeah i think there are definitely are ways that both parents can work and have recent you know responsible and and you know very loving children growing up and staying that way but i think it takes the effort and extra time and effort out of those parents and not too many not as many people are doing that as they should because we're used to having an easy get it when you want it society and um-hum uh you know uh the easy way out is considered more appropriate sometimes than than the working hard methods that used to be um-hum i have a friend who's a principal in school and she said that a lot of the parents that she calls they just flat don't wanna be bothered so right i think we're all tired and having too many pressures and i just occurred when you mentioned principal it occurred to me when i was teaching how um it was becoming quite disturbing realizing how many crack babies were there were becoming you know out there in the educational area and um-hum um-hum and the things that we'll be dealing with just on the educational front that um are people that will children that will eventually grow to be older possible crime makers themselves because they started out in life with having so many you know uh um-hum  go what have you seen do you want to talk first about the one that you've seen or you want me to go oh mine was too scary go ahead the last movie that i saw was Little Man Tate oh was it good it was was a lot of fun yeah it was um real popular obviously it was about a week after it'd come out i think uh-huh and uh i didn't really have any um preconceived notions of what it was gonna be about so it was fun to i don't wanna tell you about it i don't know if i should uh uh-huh yeah have you seen Paradise with uh Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson no i haven't seen that one either i was hoping you well um no no let's see what else have you seen recently we can talk about one we've both seen well i rented we rented my daughter and her friend i have teenagers rented Silence of the Lambs uh-huh oh have you seen it oh it's no see that that's the kind of film that i probably wouldn't see um there's certain ones that my husband and i know that he might see with a friend and i wouldn't want to see yeah well i probably shouldn't have yeah i i don't know that i don't know my husband chose not to watch it and he obviously slept all night and i prayed really hard that my kids wouldn't have nightmares and i had nightmares for two nights did you yeah oh it's just it's so interesting but it that is the last one that i saw on home video and and did your kids have any reaction to it what were the kind of comments that they had well i probably shouldn't have let my younger ones watch it they are um seven and nine and eleven years old but and especially after this Jeffrey Dahmer thing really had my eleven year old going uh-huh uh-huh oh boy you know and it was and he had lots of questions and i had to do a lot of reassuring but what my kids made some really interesting observations about how Hannibal the Cannibal you know was um playing with this gal's mind uh-huh uh-huh they were aware that that you know which was something he was supposed to watch for and i mean it was very awful and you know it teaches them to yeah um be careful of strangers and and and yeah yeah i guess there is that in those scary movies there's definitely the element of uh caution oh yeah so that was but i have bought Fantasia for my kids and myself actually you know i i would like that as well i i've been looking for that and i haven't found it yet but i know that it's um i think it's at not not the warehouse but uh Costco those those kind of places kind of discount places yeah yeah yeah Blockbuster Video that's the one that i think i heard that it was oh yeah but you yeah you can just buy now the one i'm buying is a used one which i don't get till December so people will be using it until December but i got it for nine bucks so oh that's great you know yeah well i hope it'll be okay that's the one movie of all movies that i'm gonna buy no i i have to ask you about foreign films have you seen Angel at My Table no is it wonderful uh oh it's kind of like My Left Foot if you had a chance to see that it's very much like that you know it focuses on an individual who has oh yes yes i did see that oh well in in her case she's very very shy uh-huh um and that's not a physical disability but it's certainly a social emotional disability in her case and it it's really beautiful you know because it shows how she blossoms and and about her her her development oh yeah sure oh Angel at My Table uh-huh um another one that i really liked was called Truly Madly Deeply okay we'll keep an eye out nope i believe it's a British film as well and it came well there there are a couple they they tend to you know show up in San Francisco so so you like foreign films yes yeah more than Yakima Washington i'm afraid there are a couple theaters that usually show good ones you can count on them to show foreign films that you you feel like you might enjoy as opposed to some that are so eclectic that you can't really relate to them right uh-huh right right and um Truly Madly Deeply is a love story about a person's let's see it's her husband that dies it came out shortly after Ghost ooh oh and Ghost was your one of your favorites so um i i kind of i kind related to it a little bit because it it was about her husband's love and her love being so strong that he was able to sort of converse with her after he died in such a way to kind of help her make the separation from his death because she was having really hard time grieving for like a year or so after his death and ooh uh-huh and it was called what Truly Truly Madly Deeply Truly Madly Deeply uh-huh that's how they they used to have a a a game about how much they loved each other they'd loved each other truly no truly madly no truly madly deeply sounds wonderful oh i see oh it sounds wonderful yeah it's a sweet film it's actually kind of a a spoof on life after death because uh-huh he not only comes back to visit her and help her make the transition after his death but he brings all of his his friends and a lot of them are you know playing cards in her house and his friends oh jamming on musical instrument it it's pretty it's pretty funny oh well that would be comforting in a way you know oh well that's great um what else have i seen oh well we went to see um and you won't you don't go see dumb things but it was called Hot Shots totally a waste of um Hot Shot  um i guess i i've rented most of the time so i i haven't done much home repair uh i do small little little odd jobs uh-huh yeah i i live here at home with my parents and uh not too long ago uh we uh put in a a storage room out in the in the back part of our hall here we took took part of the garage and turned it into inside of the house and walled it off and put cabinets and stuff in and took a good gee probably two months to do all of it working on weekends and stuff like that yeah i i worked uh with a guy uh it was quite a few years ago uh and um he built uh his own homes stuff like that and um-hum i i helped him quite a bit as from from everything from the carpentry work right electrical plumbing just about everything yeah so it was kind of fun to do that yeah the i uh i worked construction on a a new American Airlines building out here for couple of weeks hanging hanging six stories off a side of a building from scaffolding isn't my idea of fun no no no no that's uh i prefer to keep my feet on the ground and stuff like that but uh yeah yeah no i had a have a job kind of delves into uh construction a little bit where uh we worked on wooden railroad bridges um-hum and uh some of them uh in the country uh get pretty high and and you're overlooking uh yeah uh a small body of water mostly rocks down there and uh yeah yeah i can imagine that's uh and you're just yeah so uh it's not fun to work too high but uh you know the uh i think more what they're talking about is into the the homes and yeah the the home improvement stuff basically most of that i've you know done some minor minor repairs electrically and minor repairs plumbing uh stuff like yeah my my dad and i are always having to fix light switches or put in new new uh outlets and stuff because you know mama wants another another outlet somewhere so we go climbing around in the attic and dropping wire and cutting holes in the wall yeah yeah i i enjoy doing a lot of projects like that but not alone yeah yeah i i prefer having someone that uh has some knowledge in that and and i uh help and learn and uh go that route but yeah if i had to tackle something you know building an addition totally by myself uh i wouldn't enjoy it at all yeah it's it doing something like that you have to you have to plan it all out and make sure that you've got all your your measurements and calculations down before you ever even start to knock a hole in a wall or something you know yeah uh but uh we didn't i mean we that that room that we built we put they we built cabinets and stuff and made a little desk top and my mom put uh uh some tile on the on the desk top so it's it's like a it's it's a just a flat board that has tile on it hm uh-huh it she doesn't she doesn't ever go back and sit in it or write on it or anything i think she just did it for decoration oh but uh well sounds like quite a project there yeah it was it was sometimes fun yeah yeah i guess lot of times when uh i don't know when you're pressed for time and have to do it and wanna get it done then it doesn't become fun anymore right i think the the smaller projects tend to be more fun something you can finish in you know maybe a week or something but yeah thing things that that that take a long time or you're doing them in the middle of the summer when it's hot is is not fun yeah yeah well uh especially uh stuff like roofing when you're doing it in yeah ninety to a hundred degree weather and uh and the sun's bouncing off the roof to start with and so yeah it's even hotter and yeah yeah for sure working with uh the the black the black tar paper it that stuff gets really hot yeah and then it almost seems like lot of that uh tile up there is is almost starting to melt in your hands yeah it's real hard to handle yep well i don't know about you but i'm i'm about out uh yeah i i i i think we're at a at a loss here yeah so i think we'll just end it short okay it was nice talking to you bye-bye yeah bye  okay so what do you guys having up there i haven't been up there since oh Lord forty eight i guess well no no it wasn't forty eight it was it was uh forty eight that's a long time um let's see yeah it was forty eight i was in the Air Force we did an we did an air show out at uh out at uh uh-huh Bowling Green no out at um Andrews yeah Andrews so what's it been like up there well for the past week or two it's been cold and wet uh-huh but before that for most of the year it's been hot and dry yeah uh like September was hot and drier October um September's really was i'm not sure about October i think for about twelve months through September the the average temperature had been higher than normal each month really huh um lots of ninety degree days during the summer it really has been strange here this year i mean this whole year course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one but uh we had uh you you know all these we have all these uh uh somebody said you know you're either a stranger or a fool if you try to predict Texas weather but we had all these people saying it was gonna be the hottest summer ever you know and we had all this rain and it really is not a bad summer at all really cool but all of a sudden in in um in October good um September October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time then uh then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping just pouring down you know and flash floods everywhere and that kind of deal and then uh uh end of November the first like the second week um you know the first week actually we had we had a freeze yep and the average you know the average uh first frost is like the fifteenth of November here but usually it's not until later it's really strange oh if you had it early yeah i think we usually have a frost in October yeah um but you know we really need the rain that we've been getting and it has not today but the last few days it's been been pouring most of the day is it is it is it flooding anywhere is it flooding anywhere i have not heard of it any problems of it flooding anywhere i mean that's occurred certainly at times in the past but uh no i've not heard of any particular problems this time it just kind of uh cloud we're supposed to to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here uh which will be you know a little bit more typical uh autumn weather but really it's strange we haven't really had an autumn it's like we went into winter without you know the the poor trees said what what's that yes yeah yeah yeah we had we had uh summer lasting long and then it then it then it became winter like yeah uh uh and uh today it's today it's it's sort of change it's warmer to sort of more typical autumn day yeah there you you know usually there's uh i have a a farm a hundred miles east of here in East Texas hm and you know all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to Maine you know it's that same trees pines and and hard woods you know hickories and oaks and stuff and um i was up there last weekend and there are trees that that still have their leaves on and they're green but they're dead you know the freeze the freeze just got them they they weren't ready for it at all apparently and and we haven't had a typical fall at all no not much color and you know changes have a color at all guess not really weird this year i'm not sure what that what that means i don't know yeah our leaves are are all on the on the ground now i think it was a especially good winter for fall colors so you you all actually had some color huh it kind of crept in and the oh yeah yeah oh yeah we we did for a time yeah it's usually beautiful up there isn't it um-hum oh gorgeous that's yeah i'd i'd say you could drive along in Maryland and and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the and the pines and what not and and you could you know you could be driving along East Texas and it looks just the same it's almost you know identical identical kind of country um-hum but not this year for the trees for the leaves beautiful yeah oh really yeah i was up i was up there cutting some firewood this weekend yeah pull little oak tree that was dead and hm cut it up and split it it was kind of fun yeah this is because it it can't tolerate a freeze this early is that right well if it would came later it'd be all right uh it it there's some trees like the oaks like a white oak seem to be pretty hearty that nothing bothers them their leaves are still green and some of the other oaks there are a few oaks that have lost their leaves um what i notice mostly is the red maples the the leaves are just dead the dogwoods look still look you know they got uh bit on the ends of leaf a little bit but they still look pretty good hm it just depends on the on the uh on the tree  okay do you well the magazines that

weekly uh-huh and it and i just didn't seem to have time to sit down and read it oh we we're always reading magazines because we we don't really subscribe to them we usually buy them off the rack and we're always buying Life and People and um yeah oh a few others i can't really think about but we're we're always reading magazines in this house and oh and Time Time and um yeah um-hum so we're we're we're always reading magazines in this house yeah and um we saved all the Time Magazines from the um from when um we went to war so we have all of those uh-huh well we saved yeah we saved them we thought maybe maybe they'd you know uh-huh huh you have a whole collection from the Gulf War well that's a good idea be useful later on in life when the boys grow up because we have two small yeah yeah yeah do you get Life every month um no the we don't purchase subscribe to those we just get them like maybe no yeah when it looks interesting yeah yeah uh-huh maybe once every three months or something like that but i haven't gotten a copy of that in well actually i don't know i my parents used to take it and uh when it was weekly um-hum uh-huh and that that was i used to read it all the time then and i really haven't looked at it much since it went monthly except in the grocery line picking it up and looking looking at the pictures in it looked looked interesting uh-huh yeah and my husband is the kind of person that prefers prefers the um what do you call those the uh The Sun and um The Star yeah those suck yeah he likes he loves those he'll read he'll read those all the time oh yeah those the the tabloid things oh does he really and and and and you and you fess up to it huh no i just i don't i don't read them but you admit your husband does huh yeah he does all the time and isn't that funny huh and he'll sneak one home every once in a while in the grocery cart but that's just those i don't know those are just things i don't really i don't know i don't really find interesting i don't believe and he'll show me an article or two i i i don't believe it anyway so it's not really yeah i glance at them in line um but the stories are so ridiculous you know i mean uh that's what he does he he'll stand in line and just laugh right seven year old gives birth to twins and um uh uh ninety nine year old uh elopes with ten year i mean you know i just huh yeah yeah well he he loves all of those yeah so those are his kind of great role model for the kids i guess um-hum i read um the newspaper like every day and i guess um as i was thinking about it before the what i guess i like about the magazines is the article they'll cover the same material sort of uh-huh but more more um more in depth and more thought out and more the whole picture instead of just you know one little yeah uh-huh yeah yeah we usually just get get the newspaper on weekends because we really don't have time during the week but we usually get Friday's Saturday's and Sunday's and that's really about it but uh we read like the Dallas Life Magazine you know in there and yeah uh-huh uh-huh those kind of pretty interesting so i mean just talking to you i i i realize how much we read i didn't really realize that that's just amazing say it sounds like you read quite a bit really yeah yeah we do now that i think about it we do read a lot so i don't i've gotten to where i don't get one unless i'm on a trip a magazine oh really oh yeah just just about i mean i'll pick up when i'm going somewhere i'll pick up a People and and uh usually a Sports Illustrated and uh occasionally i'll go to the library and and uh uh-huh yeah and uh you know they have all the current ones every every week and i'll sit down and and read them read them there yeah yeah yeah that's a good idea yeah i've only done it once but i yeah well i uh i've got teenage kids so i you know they're usually there doing stuff and i'm and not ready to leave at the appointed hour so i end up i end up sitting you know while they're yeah oh  so how do you keep up on current events well i take the a daily paper i take the Houston Chronicle and uh when i my ritual in the morning is get my cup of coffee and the paper and sit down and check the headlines and at the same time i've got uh CNN on TV so uh that's sort of how i start the day is uh finding out what's going on and then uh in my business i'm in the oil business and we keep a a television tuned to CNN all day long and uh at a very at a real low volume uh that started back whenever we had the the war and uh the oil market was very volatile um-hum and it's something that we just you know we've we've stayed with and we've all kind of got accustomed to it and whenever there's anything exciting happening well we're we've got the access to it right away that's right your usually probably probably more adept at more adept adept at the news uh than most people i would assume i uh i don't quite have as the as regimented of a ritual as you do i get up in the morning if i don't have to go to work and i'll grab the paper i'll usually pull out the sports section and the business section and try to read those two first and then after i get through those i'll turn to the front front page news and and uh if an article catches my my my eye i'll i'll read it otherwise i'll just flip through the paper and you know like i said if if nothing really sounds interesting i'll just skip over it yeah yeah well i i'm i'll have to admit now Monday through Friday my newspaper reading is pretty much uh hit the high points and let it go but on Sundays i really i really dig into it i'm i'm a pretty voracious uh Sunday paper reader that's a a big part of my uh Sundays relax with the Sunday paper and coffee and breakfast and just go completely through it but um do you do you guys have a pretty uh pretty thick paper there in in Houston on Sundays yeah the uh the Chronicle is it's you know it's similar to uh i guess the Dallas Morning News okay that's that's a good that's a good sized paper yeah yeah there's there's a couple hours project right there yeah but it it's always kind of i mean and it is something i take a lot of pleasure in i i thoroughly enjoy it but it's always amazed me uh i don't know i've got a my brother in in Austin for instance that i mean he never looks at the paper he's not interested you know and it's just it's kind of astounding to me i'm i subscribed to Time magazine uh-huh oh i guess for five or six years nonstop you know and and it was a good source for a lot of information but uh-huh then i moved and didn't renew my subscription and now i don't i kind of got out of the habit of that but um i'm i'm interested in what's going on in the world and like to stay as you know as as as current as i as one can um right i know uh oh i generally work pretty late and consequently i'm not able to uh catch the the evening news but if i on on on the occasions that i do get in early enough i like to watch the ABC evening news i like uh uh right uh Peter Jennings yeah a lot better than any of the other uh announcers was that Peter Jennings yeah okay i uh admittedly don't really tune myself into the into either the five thirty the local news or the six o'clock news i uh it usually ends up being a repeat of what was in the morning paper or else if it's early enough it'll be in the next day's paper and uh um-hum the local news is is to me it isn't that interesting because it's generally not too much human interest stuff it's more the you know somebody died here or we had a fire here right right and uh i don't know i i when i was growing up i used to watch it all the time and maybe that was because i i grew up in a small town where the local news meant something to me because i could relate to the area or to the town or to the people but you know in in when you have a a Dallas Fort Worth market i really don't care what happened in Fort Worth or Arlington for that matter yeah yeah yeah well it interesting that it that you know you mention a small town i have a friend of mine who um she's a school teacher and this year um moved into a to a pretty small town i mean we're talking about maybe sixteen thousand people or so and is teaching school there she really does she loves her um-hum her work and she likes living there she said the part of it that drives her crazy is is she's accustomed to living in a city and having a big newspaper and she said you know it's the little things  okay do i recycle cans that's about it uh-huh aluminum cans yeah my son do you recycle newspapers or anything no because there's no really place i think if they had more visible places for you to drop stuff um-hum people would do it more instead of trying you know it's because it's hard it's bad enough you got to save the stuff but then you got to go find somewhere to put it if they i think they would right how about glass jars those are recyclable but none of it i mean see at at work all i do is paper and trash and cans huh and then at home i just save cans because i i know where that is that's like on the way to work but i don't know where the paper and the the bottles and all that stuff is but i think if like apartment complexes uh-huh honey i'm on the phone long distance how had to yell at my kids had to yell at my kids how many kids you got well i have four oh and we try and recycle my husband is in the packaging business and um they use recycled newspapers shredded up uh-huh for the filler for uh it's a pad that they put on top top of apples boxed apples when they ship apples and it absorbs some of the you know the when the apples get the shipping you know uh yeah oh i know yeah my husband my husband hauls apples oh he does for what company what trucking company um-hum uh he's independent he hauls them for anybody oh that's great well he may have some of our apples then probably Washington's a very big apple growing yep place especially Yakima you'll have to look for Yakima Washington on some of the box labels and CVC Weyerhaeuser that's us yep uh-huh that's us well so they have a recycling actually they it's called Central Washington Recycling and they have a a whole center and they have it set up like a circus yeah where you know the green glass goes in this clown's mouth and the tin cans go up to the alligator and and so we uh we don't recycle as much as we should but we do recycle newspapers and cans and bottles yeah i think if they would if they would have it more where you can get it right get to it you know like in different places like apartment complexes they got trash cans why not put the dumpsters for different things and uh and and that way people would find it better right right i think that'd be a great idea we're gonna right right but if you can't find it i would like to see them i would who's gonna save it you know because after a while you get tired of saving newspapers i mean yes you do you sure do in fact i put mine in my garage and i'm sick of them but um-hum we take them my little girl she gets a collect the money you know since she has to haul them down there every day so i let her keep the money um i was thinking the other day about um uh-huh plastic gloves that the dentists and doctors and everybody has to wear now that'd be wonderful if they could recycle those you know as it is now they can't yeah yeah but see those are they can't well i think they're nonrecyclable yeah i think because of the the disease and all that going around they don't know you know they're they're calling them uh like what do you call it contaminated yeah right contaminated is what they are you know they but that you know plastic just doesn't disintegrate huh-uh and that that's major thing i mean how many pairs of gloves they go through in a day they use pair of gloves for every patient they see right and i'm just thinking about the orthodontist where i take my child you know for his braces they use gloves for everybody i mean the the nurse you the the dentist his assistant everybody in there has on gloves and and then yeah yep yep everybody yep well it's too bad that they have to but be nice if those somehow could be recycled uh-huh you know that'd be better for everybody yep but they don't recycle those so and then the baby diapers you know i don't have anybody in diapers any more but gosh i used my share of disposable diapers now i didn't use those i had a a diaper service yeah well that's good in the service because i couldn't my son was allergic to something in the plastic oh yep so i had so it wasn't by choice yeah but that's that i couldn't use them it's just he couldn't wear them for some reason i don't know what it was uh-huh yeah i used them with my last two uh-huh but he couldn't wear them because of the something was he was allergic to something uh-huh so i had to put regular diapers on him boy that was a you know for a while i had the service but then you know after i didn't have it the whole time but the first i think the first yeah yeah it gets really expensive yeah but see i think if people go back to cloth diapers that's better for recycling i mean that's better for the environment yeah because you can always you just wash those you know so sure well i see in the future i see people uh being more conscious of we're gonna be forced to recycle yeah you know i see even plastic shopping bags there's you can return those and our grocery bags our paper grocery bags has a five cent refund on them if you bring them back to the store do yours there you can return those uh-huh oh they do oh that's oh no huh-uh if they did that i would take them back all the time because i go to the same store all the time well see and i always forget and you know with four kids and you know six people in this family our grocery bill's pretty high and you know i get you know thirty or more than that yeah i get fifty yeah but i think if they'd do it more with the with the money like a nickel or penny even though people think it's not enough but if you have enough yep uh people don't understand a quarter's a quarter it doesn't matter that's right you you know my son could take a quarter and go buy him a candy bar or something but i you bet oh yeah  okay well it's not often you get uh many women interested in football do you follow football very much oh well i'm sorry what do you follow football very much i don't no i i haven't recently um we can talk about something else do you have any uh you married no i'm not no no i guess kids are out what's that i said kids are out yep are you married yeah i've i'm married i've got two boys oh really yeah wow so do you like football oh i follow the uh the Cowboys but that's about it uh see see same here yeah do you live in Dallas yeah i i i am a pretty big Dallas fan and been for a long time yeah but but uh i haven't been to any games recently but uh i try to catch the game every weekend that i can really yeah have you ever been to a Cowboys game i haven't hum-um um it's pretty nice we decided we decided just to watch them at home but that's good at least you uh follow the game a little bit yeah um yeah i'm not a fanatic about it i don't know who played when and who does what like some guys are i just like to watch and and hopefully they win that's about the extent of it um-hum yeah right now i'm in um college so i'm more into college football than professional i think oh i see what uh school are you going to um i'm at BYU BYU oh okay yeah so Leslie what are you studying nursing nursing great my mom's an LVN yeah oh really yeah cool so what are you planning to go into do you want to be an RN or yeah yeah um i haven't really picked a field i haven't i i don't know i've i've thought a lot about labor and delivery but i don't know um-hum try that that's what my mom does labor and delivery oh really wow yeah she loves it she she really uh enjoys is she a nurse in Dallas no she's a nurse in San Antonio oh but uh she's been she's been working a uh a late shift she works the uh i guess the graveyard's what you'd call it she works the graveyard shift uh-huh and she's worked that for oh years when i was small hm um i guess probably going on twenty years now wow and she really enjoys it she likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night and uh and um uh she's uh she just started a new job at a different hospital closer to where she lives um-hum and she's really enjoying herself she really likes it well that's great hm well good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree oh thanks think you'll like it you plan on staying in in the Dallas area yeah um i'd like to come back to Dallas right now i'm in Utah of course so um but my family's there so yeah i'd like to go back oh huh um-hum yeah uh i think Texas uh San Antonio in particular has got a large uh base of hospitals uh i don't know about Dallas i think Dallas is pretty scattered are you in San Antonio no i'm i'm in Dallas but i i'm originally from San Antonio oh okay hm and they've got a large medical uh center down there they've got the uh UT Health Science Center out there also right so if you ever wanted you know pursue anything more than your nursing degree that that'd be the place to do it yeah my brother-in-law um is in the medical profession i mean he's at medical school school in San Antonio right now um-hum oh great so great yeah well like i said good luck to you thanks all right well um take care and maybe we'll meet up again sometime all right bye-bye okay bye-bye  hello hi my name is uh Donna Donahue and i live in Plano Texas hi hi my name is Lowell and i live in Raleigh North Carolina oh okay um do you wanna start or would should i start go right ahead okay um i would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in we have um three children and um they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports soccer and baseball and well my little girl goes to tap dance and my little one goes to preschool and um i'm home with the children just do a lot of running around it seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type i don't know life um what about you i'm i'm single and i i live in a town home here in Raleigh and it's pretty typical of the other town homes in the area there we we have a lot of town homes here uh-huh uh-huh okay um-hum as well as single family homes and at the time that i bought this one it was just a a much better arrangement for me personally i'm not home a lot i travel a great deal with my job and um-hum so it was easier to have a home that didn't exactly that somebody else looks out for the maintenance was sort of maintenance free yeah oh yeah well um that that sounds that sounds pretty good because i know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends not so much now but to um maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds and it's a lot of work owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it it's it certainly is sometimes i think um it would be nice to have a town home with not having all that responsibility well if you ever get one be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear i that's the main thing when i was shopping for one i wanna make sure i couldn't it i couldn't here my neighbors and it was so i bought one that's more like living in a once you're inside you don't know you're in a town home right oh that sounds lovely it is they're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of right side by side so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you um-hum um-hum so in in your area then there's probably a lot of um career type people that have those type homes and uh-huh and um yes definitely the area that we're settled in is um definitely young young families with with kids they're still doing um a lot of building in the neighborhood so the people that move here seem to move from all over the country which we're from um the Northeast and um seems like a lot of people just don't also also don't have any family around so it um also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors and you know um but um that's i well we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees um-hum people who don't wanna the heat of Florida but don't want the heat of the northeast the cold of the northeast so they settle sort of in between right right um-hum now it's um is it very very wooded around where you are there lots of pretty trees and yeah yes as a matter of fact this is a uh this particular community that i live in is very wooded oh how pretty it is nice it i do miss that um around here in Plano there are very few trees and it's pretty flat and and kind of barren and that's the only thing that we don't like about living in Texas is we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall and and um uh the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is you know in the North um or even where you are uh we definitely have a lot of trees here a lot of leaves to rake up too i bet yes but fortunately the home owner's association does all that yeah does that well see that's another plus yes i don't have to worry about that and this is the time of year we're starting the leaves are all falling now that's right that's right they are i'm gonna get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done we just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but not not much just just a little kind of just in more of a makes a little bit of a mess for a few weeks then if you didn't do anything about it then they'd probably the leaves would just blow away so it's not too bad right okay do we have to speak for a certain amount of time okay okay well it was really nice speaking to you no i don't think so it was good to speak with you too okay and have a happy Thanksgiving thank you you too bye bye bye bye  uh well i guess social change takes in a a big category but uh i guess the the one aspect of it that i took in uh consideration uh is more economical hm i i know that the the amount of or or how far your dollar goes probably more than anything has has greatly changed yeah i agree i know they they did a it was on a talk show uh they took uh uh the parents and then the uh the son and they compared income at different points in time when the when the father was you know was a little bit younger and more in his heyday and they and they compared to the son's that he was making now um-hum and even though the son was probably more successful you know higher up in the the management ladder uh his he was actually making less money right and when you costs when you go by a costs of living right um-hum i guess depending on where you live though too yeah i know just uh just with me ten years ago i i was comparing uh i think i i was living better ten years ago than i am now even though i'm making more money now but my dollar went a lot farther yeah true uh ten years ago i was eleven so um i remember though like buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now and gas and i used to hear stories from my Grandpa and yeah you know he could see a movie for like a nickel and things like that yeah well i i know gas prices have definitely jumped uh from uh i know i used to pay twenty five cents a gallon and now it's over a buck i don't know what it's uh by you and around here Minnesota Wisconsin area it's yeah uh it's dropping but i think it's about a dollar fifteen on an average yeah i'm from Wisconsin yeah it's about um yeah okay yeah well that's uh that's unusual most of the people i talk to are Texas so oh yeah i spoke to a person from Texas too yeah this is only my second phone call so i'm just waiting for more oh i suppose this will be one of my towards my last one pretty soon i'm sure they'll stop me but uh i'm uh i'm pretty much out of things say to say oh about like social changes yeah hum um i i don't think this would have anything to do with it but like clothing and styles lot of those changed okay yeah i i i don't think they they consider like i said it's a broad category it's just uh not economical but yeah yeah uh even attitudes um-hum definitely on on clothing and stuff uh i know towards each other yeah i i i know a lot of the things that that we wear men wear now a days were would've been considered uh feminine uh many years ago um-hum yeah but the uh i know it's been it was hard for me at first but now i kind of like you know a lot of the bright colors yeah i mean like i think i used to be more uh conservative and just your basic colors but now i i do like some of these uh brighter fluorescent colors yeah but they styles come and go all the time though it's just ridiculous fads in and out and even um clothing from the sixties came back i see a lot of um girls wearing sixties clothes yeah yeah i i i guess uh the best thing i like to see from the sixties and seventies is of course is the mini skirt of course oh yeah one of the nice things but uh yeah i i i don't think that there's anything as original it's it's all based on uh one of the past styles they just uh make their uh circle and come back again yeah so if you hang onto your clothes long enough uh they'll they'll be back in style in a few years yeah that's true maybe some day i probably won't be alive to see it but prices might go down lot more i don't know though doesn't look good yeah well i think like thinking back i think the only style i hope doesn't come back is bell bottoms yeah i remember that i do i guess when i look at pictures of myself in the bell bottoms i say God yeah i didn't really care for them either uh or now i won't  what do you think about capital punishment well i'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes yeah which crimes do you feel that well i think first degree murder um probably warrants it yeah because most so many times that's so brutal and just recurrent right felons i think should also exactly recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or whatever yeah i come from a state that has well i originally come from a state that has uh the death penalty i come from Florida and uh they're pretty liberal on it they tend to like fry people left and right which go ahead uh-huh yeah that's a go ahead Texas is too Texas i saw on TV the other night is the has had forty six in like the past several years yeah so they're pretty hip on it too i guess they do it by lethal injection at Huntsville yeah okay i think Florida still uses electric chair yeah um i don't i don't know in some ways i don't like it because it's like you're playing God yeah and that's not you know i don't think that's right but on the other hand there's a lot of advantages to it i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it yeah and of course you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not yeah um with Florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year they yeah that's what's happening here there is like um that's in fact a big gubernatorial issue is the the turn over rates of um-hum um repeat uh repeat offenders being let out and doing it again sure and it's like you know that's a big problem but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build um-hum and it's really you know it's it gets to be a a really a big problem yeah um go ahead i wish if they if they were gonna do it they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't be a little more you know not being able to put it off for fifteen years right um-hum yeah because a lot of these guys you know they get in and they they get off for good behavior and i don't know i mean up in Minnesota where i am now they don't have the death penalty and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system you know because they figure well you know sure i i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something um but then for if i if i elicit good behavior i'm out in maybe five or ten oh really oh sure you know i mean just because like we said before they don't have enough room in the jails um you know there's a lot of incentive for them to be let out early goodness um-hum yeah but if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head um i don't know i think that may solve a lot of that maybe not solve it but yeah i don't know maybe even help a little bit i yeah i tend to think the repeal system for the death penalty is a little little too lenient um kind of takes away yeah from the significance of the death penalty um-hum what do you do Georgeanne i'm a graduate student at the University of Texas in Dallas oh okay great what program you in um Audiology okay fantastic uh i'm a doctoral student at University of Central Florida yeah what do you do oh really yeah i'm doing an internship up at Honeywell oh really neat uh yeah but um i don't know it's it's an interesting issue there's like you say in Texas there's been quite a few and and in Florida in the last few years i think there's been a lot i can't i i mean i can't give you figures but um yeah i just and this was in conjunction with a guy that was put in the gas chamber in California so i i think it the forty sixth in last twenty five years i think it's what they gave a run down that Texas uh-huh oh is that right okay Texas tends to be a little more robust and disciplined area then yeah i i kind of yeah i've heard things about that i've heard that they don't mess around very much yeah yeah um they they don't get repealed as easily as they do um-hum like in the guy in California got third you know twice before he went to the gas chamber and then they said okay no you don't have to go and then they took him back i mean it just seems jeez that's a lot of repeals yeah it just seemed a little inconsistent and then you had like who you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back whenever you know um-hum yeah i don't know i i'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it uh i guess what is it what's the policy now with treason do they uh do they axe you for treason or is it a life sentence i no i don't i don't think um the military doesn't execute anymore so yeah or death before the firing squad or whatever yeah so i think about the only one is um rape  okay um read any good books lately uh yes i i've read uh several good books lately uh lot of them uh related to um business and financial matters since that's what i do for a living oh okay um-hum how about yourself uh well i'm in graduate school and so i read a lot of books but i don't know if i consider very many of them good um i haven't read a book for enjoyment since i guess around Christmas um i received received uh uh several books for Christmas and at Christmas break i read uh Sarum by uh uh a fellow named Rutherford yes uh it's the history of um well it's sort sort of the historical the historical fiction about uh the Salisbury area in in England um-hum uh and so uh i i really enjoyed that book a lot uh he's not quite as good as you know Michener or some of uh some of the other historical writers but he he did his job well so yeah well that sounds good uh do you find it uh do do you find you have much chance to read for for just pleasure or mostly for business no i read for pleasure some also i read a book recently called Iron John have you seen that by Bly um-hum i don't think i have seen it okay well it's a book about uh uh Greek gods and and Greek um mythology uh-huh as well as uh men and interacting with other men and a book about uh men and how they mature through life um-hum and how they deal with life itself oh okay i think i have heard about that yeah but it's uh it's all revolved around uh mythology uh-huh uh as far as uh traditions from uh other cultures and our culture um-hum and how we uh interact with one another um-hum yeah that sounds great did did it have something to mention about um sort of uh cultural rituals of of manhood yes okay yeah i have heard of that i have uh someone suggested that i read it is it Iron John yes okay good by Bly B L Y i believe it is B L Y okay um-hum great and uh it's a very interesting book uh-huh uh what are your favorite uh do you have a favorite subject to read whether it be science fiction or or history or well it depends again if we're talking about uh um i read a lot of religious books um-hum uh just because i have an interest in that area um-hum and i read a lot of books in the area of uh um psychology and self help type uh materials um-hum okay uh always trying to understand people better and understand myself in a relation to other people and try to understand where the people are coming from because i'm in a people business um-hum um-hum okay and uh so that's that's that that's my work is my hobby um-hum that's so i i enjoy it sounds great um uh who is your uh who is your favorite religious author well i don't know if i have a favorite uh-huh uh religious author i would have to say that uh some of the ones that consistently put out good materials uh you know that that's difficult because one person might write one book real extremely well and some other ones might not write as well um-hum uh i have to stop here and think a second one of the ones that i've read recently that i've read several of his books and i thought that each one of his books were good he's the man out of San Antonio and uh Max Lucado Max Lucado yeah Max consistently consistently writes good books yeah uh he's a great man i've met him several times uh yes i i know him yeah uh uh but uh there's other authors also that have uh uh that write good books from time to time but not consistently put out the materials all the time um-hum um i'd say another which is a local writer here in Plano um is i'm trying to think of his name he's with the Bible church and that is uh i see his name but i can't i mean i see him but i can't see his name but he uh he talks about uh he talks about a lot of different topics and dimensions of the church and um-hum  start it sure okay uh basically i work for the government and our health insurance plan seems to be okay but it seems the benefits are are eroding and the cost of insurance goes up uh i don't know why the post people post office people pay one third out of their paycheck for the same insurance that we're getting uh right now i'm in we're physicians health plan and that costs about thirty five bucks a paycheck but yet the postal people will only pay less than ten dollars a paycheck it's called the union yes probably yes full payment one percent and i'm sure not everybody has they're probably getting their worth and MasterCard's cheaper too well i am all for universal health insurance um being up here in New York um our local Blue Cross Blue Shield people have i'm i'm now paying every month because i'm self-employed one hundred and three dollars a month for basic health care coverage um actually i'm sorry it's more than that well it's four hundred dollars a quarter um-hum so it's probably a little more than that gosh yeah that's a steep one and frankly i don't i think that if we can take what's been done in Canada and given every body a choice as far as who they want for their health care frankly i think that the reason that we're in so much trouble and and and it's such an anticompetitive um uh stance right now as far as doing battle with these other companies is that we are really burdening our American corporations with health care costs which they have to build in to the price of their product whereas if you go to some one of these overseas countries Japan for example where the government pays all of that um-hum the you don't have to build that in to the cost of the product um they usually nail the product you know you pay as as an individual versus um having a company dragged down by these insane health care costs and i think that we should have a health care system in this country that everybody can get access to and uh have it universal i agree there because i you know Saturday afternoon you're playing baseball and you break your arm you don't know what it's going to cost you for the x-rays and everything else like that if you don't have some type of health plan that you can afford and i'm sure there's a lot of people that live paycheck to paycheck to where they cannot and afford fifty bucks every paycheck for a health insurance plan and i know i and when i was in Germany i was in the service but at the same time there was an agreement that if you went to a hospital there in Germany that they knew they could bill uncle Sam for that hospital care so they didn't give us any hassle medical care there and my brother and my dad are over there and it's a great health insurance plan for them i think that's going to cost us money as far as taxes if our government gets into it because they all haven't shown a real good record for management of any kind of program yeah yeah i you know i i wouldn't even mind so much if they had a um corporation that is financed through the government or have some sort of there can be competition as long as there is a universal plan i don't oppose i do not i'm not for eliminating all private health insurance whatsoever but um you know but if if you have the ability to pay for that you can pay based on your income as a percentage and uh more fairly and equitably distribute the cost across a wide spectrum right now you know the people working this country is half the problem right there and we're seeing that's not a lot of it is private sector too um i you know it's the government is always attacked for not being able to do anything properly this is one example i don't think the private sector's doing much better though i'm pretty ignorant on taxes but on self-employed do you get any kind of credits for health insurance i get a credit this year and last year because the government specifically said i could get a credit but the uh but it is it's going to expire which means i'm paying uh i get a sum a sum uh sum of the money back but um not all of it of course um i'm in a worst off position than someone who is employed who gets their health health care taken care of by their employer um because i have to also obtain my insurance from is a third party middle man type deal i have to go to go the small business service bureau and pay eighty dollars a year just for the right to buy health insurance works well for them but it's horrible for me um you know the consumer is going to pay in the end no matter what happens so yeah i i i i cost hidden or not you just can't it's just it's sky rocketing i mean we're seeing increases every year ten to fifteen percent and you know it's it's gotten way out of hand and then and then you have these  he uh well do you use a budget uh i do at times off and on right now i'm probably in one of the more the more off times any particular reason uh that you get off of it or does it seem to work for you oh it works fine it's just i i think sometimes i you know you get busy you slack off a little bit and then you know there's no more uh i mean you know then it's work to catch up yeah uh you know then the two or three times where i've got to the point i really needed one i created one and stuck by it and you do stick by it when you do it huh yes how about you well i tend to have a monthly budget and basically what it is i list all my income coming in and the expenses and whatever's left over i spend hm you know i just that just kind of seems to be the way it works the budget i stuck on the most pardon me was the the budget i was on the most was what was called the ten twenty seventy budget and and basically ten percent of your income goes to uh uh long-term savings um-hum twenty percent goes toward uh basically short-term you know doing going out to dinner like going to the movies uh maybe you know saving that part up toward like going on you know something something a little little more short-term than like the long-term budget and then the other and then seventy percent goes toward uh uh you know paying debts and and and that kind of stuff with the whole idea being that you pay yourself first you're more likely to stick with it yes and i know that that theory unfortunately neither i'm married married and neither my husband or myself have the greatest amount of self-control in the world hm and uh so that makes it pretty easy not to stick with the budget at times you know instead of thinking oh we'll save it this month we'll think well oh gee we'll buy this lamp or this whatever you know sure so uh our savings our savings plan sometimes goes down the drain but are you married uh i will be a week from next Monday oh do you think this is going to change the way you budget your money in any way no not really have you kind of discussed this already with your fiancee yeah yeah so far for now i think uh i mean for now we've still got our own money really uh and that'll probably it'll probably be that way till uh you know we like buy our own house together or something uh-huh in which case you know it's very convenient to once again throw everything together uh well i agree it's uh maybe for us anyway it's easier just to to put it all in one big pot and not worry about who makes what or who you know who donates what to it right right but uh but we just kind of started out that way and yeah and and right now in my case it's more situation that uh that she uh uh has still got a lot of debt and it's easier for me to kind of like just shoulder oh the normal stuff uh-huh and let her concentrate on getting herself out of debt well that's a good idea do you think this is true of all women i seem to have been in debt when my husband and i got married too well i was the year before and that was the last time i really got on a budget was to really fight being in debt because i didn't like it uh no it's not a whole lot of fun so i think it's people in general yeah you have a tendency that's a tendency to do it when you can uh one of the ways i insure my long-term savings is the fact that you know i've got a 401K plan so i've got uh five percent of my income going into that uh that's actually five percent before taxes um-hum um-hum uh that could you know so that's even more and then i've also uh uh you know got a few other miscellaneous automatic deductions which i think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the money in your hand in the check you'll think oh well i just won't put anything yeah absolutely or you know even if it's of course most of us are direct deposit anymore anyway i'm sure but once it goes into the checking account it's awfully hard to transfer it over right well i've i've even got a uh fifty dollar a month uh uh mutual fund automatic transfer on the twentieth of every month that's a good idea you know once again you know you know it's there you know it's going to happen it's a uh an easier way to uh to save um-hum and uh your fiancee is she'll she goes along with the savings part too even though uh she's managed to get herself into debt no she has no saying but you're going to manage to make her stick to your plan right well sure you know you know like you said for right now we really kind of each have our own money which is maybe a weird way to do your budgeting but um-hum i i think until you know we're we're both growing because you know of that i think it'll probably stay away for awhile well actually i know some people a a girlfriend of mine who was married probably about three three or four years ago and they still have separate checking accounts that's the way they prefer it uh you know uh she doesn't go into detail as to why they prefer it that way or anything but it's everybody as long as i think uh your right  i guess what this brings to mind is uh um my chief complaint is then uh the priority that's given to kids that's what comes to mind anyway well i don't know i guess uh i think one of the biggest changes that's taken place over the last twenty five years anyway is um uh uh both parents working and the um-hum the uh mechanisms haven't really been in place to get to give kids all the attention they need yeah so i think that uh and i think we're so reaping the um results of that in uh the consequences a lot of problems yeah i mean i don't blame people for um both going to work um both parents going to work it's tough not to for a lot of people but it's been i think that may be the single biggest social change in the middle class anyway that's uh that has uh uh had a lot more repercussion that people every thought yeah yeah my wife and i have gone through a couple of decades together we're both on our early forties um um we've been married uh twenty two years so we sort of grew up together and um just had children uh so we have a four year old and a two year old um-hum and uh for the first eighteen years of our marriage um we were two income carriers and all that so we had a pretty full lifestyle and um-hum and having the children we decided to uh to go into one income so i work and she stays home tough isn't it and and it's you know the the ideal value system is is to motivate it there our situation because it it suddenly is something that uh that we thought long and hard about our situation is very much very similar Mary we're both professionals and used to working and we decided that when we had kids that we would uh have somebody home until they were uh well into school um-hum it's difficult especially it's not so much difficult financially i don't think as it is uh culturally in that it's um uh kind of expected i think i think it's difficult on my wife not to be um um-hum professionally identified and that sort of thing um-hum but i really feel like it's been worth it for the kids and when i look around i think uh i'm i'm pretty glad we made the decision we did yeah yeah we've you know experienced a lot the the turmoil of the uh sixties and seventies and uh i think we we were part of that um looking for new value systems and having uh a vision of the way the world was going to be when we were you know in middle age which i guess we are now and then all of the sudden the kids come along yeah that too but uh i just think that uh right now we're experiencing a lot of disappointment with uh our generation and and uh the way things haven't really changed and i think that uh you know our personal difficulties are reflected in a lot of the unrest right now we're seeing with respect to politics yeah yeah i i think uh you have to be um i don't want to make it uh more dramatic but you have to be kind of cultural really if you want to put your family first and uh um-hum um to sort of uh put a cap on things that you can really have and enjoy and just go ahead and um do what's right by your by your family yeah and i don't i i don't see a lot of support out there i see a lot of people um voting down school taxes and um um-hum uh well a degree of the eighties was i think uh maybe the most disappointing social phenomena that i witnessed yeah because i really did see you see it in um magnified about twenty times yeah i mean uh maybe double that again in the east coast really uh yeah and we're we're both from the mid west we're both from Saint Louis and uh experienced but we spent the entire eighties out here and uh um we're just thirty miles outside of Manhattan um-hum and uh it's very different than the mid west it's i guess the i guess the the epicenter of that uh yeah yeah i mean it you know the the kids around here stuff in the eighties uh you know think they're poor if they can't get a Polo shirt every week um-hum right it it's it's a different perspective and uh you know we got caught up in that we we we had you know a real decade of hay day an uh now we're retrenching like a lot of the rest of the country uh particularly because you know we chose to have a single income and um um also working uh in a large corporate setting and that has become unsettled in the last  do you have any thoughts on company benefits i do but uh they're pretty slanted i want you to know i'm prepared uh my company was bought by another company um-hum and the majority of us were laid off oh okay i see where this is going uh-huh so you know uh what i would like to see well uh the really sad part of this is that i'm fifty five years old that's not that bad and beg your pardon that's not so sad oh my chances of getting another job are just really slim hm i was a systems analyst for an oil company right and you know they just i mean Sprint had uh two thousand jobs open i mean i'm sorry two hundred jobs open they had two thousand applications for this type of work you know it's just uh and i guess that's that's pretty far-fetched as benefits go uh-huh but gosh you know i saw it i was fixed for life so uh i think more and more people are finding that out even people with state and and uh federal jobs it it's a shock it really is it really is but uh i i think uh i guess my feelings on this are that the one of the most important benefits we currently have is our health insurance that's true and that if there were some way to get that to follow you from job to job or so that you would not lose it if you have to leave a company isn't there some sort of deal where you can continue your benefits for eighteen months there is uh-huh and and that's fine but you know i'm still unemployed after about fourteen months okay oh yeah that's worrisome and when you switch yeah when you switch over the the premiums are really quite high and additionally i've had a heart attack um so it's going to be really tough for me to do this so you know uh in in my very personal way i feel that insurance is just one of the most important benefits we have now now with the political political situation the way it is i think that's going to change you talking about national health because i think we're going to have to have something of that sort um so that will cease to be as important a benefit i think that well i think the whole thing with this health insurance being so high is because people are what are your feelings what what do you feel suing left and right and just driving these costs up well i agree with you but do you know that's that's what makes this such a tremendous benefit if you can possible get group rates well i i have my own beef about health insurance i uh i'm not a spring chicken myself quite frankly um i raised a family and now i'd like to get back into my field which is teaching and it's at a time where school budgets are so far down that they're firing experienced people and also you know i'm i'm a art teacher which is a very small field out of a whole school there's two or three oh yes uh-huh and you know there are two hundred apliplations for one one job uh you send in a resume and they they don't even write a letter to you to say no thanks which yep they they don't have time yeah i suppose and um i do substitute teach and my biggest complaint is schools get a discount insurance school districts because they have so many people why can't they allow their substitutes to buy into it to pay ourselves just to get the lower rate that a group would have and they won't let us well you've you've approached it yeah they don't let you do it what is their thinking on it uh um i don't know i don't know have they said i just i just know it's not allowed okay have they said we cannot do this because yeah uh no not they they didn't get that far no because no because we we do we don't do this we don't do this and everybody thinks it's sort of a crying shame i have been divorced and i knew that uh when i was divorced i was allowed that eighteen months of insurance on my ex-husband's plan and i was allowed to pay for myself okay uh-huh at their lower rate and i don't see what the school district would have to lose by letting us pay for ourselves but is uh let's see are they paying a part of the premium well i they're paying all the premium for their full-time teachers oh they are yeah yeah that's part of their salary and have you offered to come in and have you offered to come in and pay the whole premium yeah and they still won't let you no no it's just not policy that's crazy yeah that just doesn't seem to make any sense so what do you do about insurance well i am remarried now and my husband um quit his job to try some consulting he's an engineer and what he did was he joined you know if you join a group sometimes it's a little less he joined the Engineer's Society or some group like that and what he did which was actually very clever most people want to have ah yeah the lowest deductible and then get eighty percent of their money back and all of this my husband said why don't we take a five hundred dollar deductible if we have a little you know annual checkup here or there we can pay that that's not the problem  so how do you feel about it uh i i i don't see any problem with with random testing for random drugs yeah i i myself almost um am in favor of it uh i work at Honeywell and i went through a a pretty i don't know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i i was brought on um-hum i think that's pretty standard at least at Honeywell it is um i think it's important to insure the quality and and uh i don't know almost the goodness of character you know and that kind of thing where do you work yeah um well i'm a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon and i i just came from Saint Paul uh interviewing with Three M oh okay oh okay hm oh great and uh they have a policy for uh testing if if you if they make you an offer then they'll test you right before you start right and i guess the only drawback i can see to to drug testing is in in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some uh sort of false positive result um-hum then there could be some sort of problem but uh it yeah yeah and that that definitely happens you know i mean those the drug tests assure us they're accurate but there's always that margin of error yeah and that's that's something to be aware of another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate or they aren't that sensitive like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they gonna do about that yeah you know i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for Honeywell and uh uh you know i know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something um i'm sure they screen for just a particular few types although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for right um i don't know what what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon uh electrical engineering oh okay great um yeah i'm a graduate student at UCF in Florida University of Central Florida and this is actually a an internship up here oh wow but um they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing so uh they they test you um before they before you start or before you even interview or right um they essentially no i sure don't um they essentially um they essentially uh made me the offer and then and then uh did the drug testing thing after that so uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests and and then they essentially give you the offer uh-huh and then at that point they'll they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that oh so uh there's some noise on this end i'm actually in a mall calling so oh yeah you probably wondered huh but so what what happens if you were to fail then do they give you like one chance one more chance or two more chances yeah that's a good question i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail i believe they give you one more chance they probably give you a chance to explain yourself um-hum and then maybe give you another chance to go through it but uh you know once again those things are not that accurate so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know but um what are you working right now anywhere or uh no i'm just about to finish my masters in May and uh just interviewing with companies right now okay oh okay great yeah that was the first time i'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know was was going to Honeywell a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there and he's doing an internship with IBM um-hum oh and uh they basically uh did the same exact thing um we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug tresting at the same time so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process but uh do do they test you at right now at work too no no that's one thing they don't do is is drug testing while you're on the job uh i think i think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it but they don't do it okay oh you know so that's good i guess i don't know i mean i uh i have gone to a couple of parties since since that time and while i don't do any drugs myself i've seen some people who work there um you know smoking a joint or whatever and uh um-hum you know that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up you know but no they don't they don't really do that wow is it formal policy that they said that they might test yeah  so interesting political trends or events huh um-hum well i guess the uh most interesting one that's uh going on right now from my perspective is this uh phenomena of um uh Ross Perot uh caught his interview last night with David Frost and it was the the first time i had you know heard um you know his views expressed by himself i had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in uh-huh uh-huh but the whole phenomena of him coming out of uh literally no where no party um at least no apparent party support on either side is pretty interesting huh yeah i have not even heard believe it or not of that person i'm not kidding when you when you said it it was kind of like a surprise um-hum like out of nowhere yeah yeah i think mainly because i haven't been watching what's politically going on um in that at you know um-hum in that aspect uh as far as like now the new health bill that went through Minnesota uh being that it is their neighboring state and that i lived in Minnesota and more familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed um-hum but um as far as politics in the grander uh part of it as if you want to look at uh election type things i'm not quite sure even if i'm going to vote uh um-hum yeah it it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that to make the decision on who would be the best to run um um-hum well it seems that the decisions so far has been filtered by uh you know party politics so much that when the candidates finally get party approval party support and therefore get presented to the public um-hum sure exactly the the candidates are already beyond what uh most public uh feels is acceptable behavior um-hum you know the one of the common criticisms of Clinton is uh gee he'll say or do anything in order to get to the White House and and up unto the point of uh Perot being a serious candidate it seems like that sure that was a requirement of being a a contender within the party is is to have done all those things um-hum sure i mean here's a here's a guy who for twenty years has been working toward you know getting the party nomination and and preparing himself for the presidency and now it seems like both he and the incumbent President are you know pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of a whole nonpolitical arena he might be a a one of those sure uh it it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer uh when you think of some of the best presidents we've had in the past have been people that have struggled to get to the top i mean they were not rich in in any means um-hum and it has been kind of in the past uh i don't know maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved involved with politics they've had to have money um-hum and you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way um um-hum so it makes the common person uh not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a a fabulous job because he's got people that are quite intelligent and i don't know if we'll ever see that you know where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and uh has um you know you think of Abraham linking Lincoln and you know just the the background of Abraham Lincoln you know teaching himself to read he didn't go to college he didn't um-hum you know do all the other things that um you know you would think that was real popular to do and to get politically politically involved and and have money he didn't come from money um um-hum yeah and and yet even he was a a consummate politician in the sense that uh not only did he fail uh fail in business twice with bankruptcy and and failure but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one and now it it um-hum sure um-hum and the first election first and only election he won was um the presidency he he had lost every other office that he had you know he was appointed a couple of times to like uh uh state legislator so you really know a lot of his background yeah then when then when he finally did when an election uh it was the presidency yeah it was the big one it's the one that everybody wants yeah whether or not uh you know you look at all these candidates that want to become President i really have to ask them why you know um yeah but yeah it's the toughest job in the world to do and not only that you don't have that much freedom to make choices i mean you have to go through so many different you got to go through the House the Congress and all of the a other things to get a bill passed um-hum um-hum and sure you can veto veto it at the last minute but then it's not like you have all that power and i think along time ago Presidents did have a lot of power and i think we're um-hum  okay uh okay so our subject is nursing homes um do you have any experience or any uh opinions on what to do i do i do have actually as a matter of fact uh and i'm i'm not sure how it would relate to the big city but there are certainly ways and humane and and nice ways of handling care for our elderly i come from a very small community in northern Iowa and the churches have banded together and built and staffed a retirement home um-hum that's wonderful and the care of course is is wonderful because these are all people who care um-hum and every week the churches a different uh groups of the churches volunteer and come in and maybe have bingo day or special celebration day or help someone with their birthday or whatever and it makes the care very personalized of course but since it is a small community everybody knows everybody and so there there would be no absolutely zero chance of any abuse um-hum um-hum that's great because uh you know i think that is probably a persons greatest fear and i'm not faced with this yet but my mother is seventy three she's in good health and living by herself but um i'll probably be faced with this you know sometime in the next few years as to what to do when mom gets to the point that she can't take care of herself um unfortunately having her come live with us you know if she needs constant care is not going to be an option and what do you do you know yeah it's it's a real problem um it is a real problem and i know that everybody hates the idea of going to one of these but i also think that it is a choice that we have all made in our lives as we have drawn back and internalized ourselves as opposed to being a part of the community um-hum uh it used to be that neighbors looked out for you the churches looked out for you but many of us don't belong to churches any more um-hum and so therefore we don't have this broadened community of caring people and we don't have the nuclear family that we used to have many many years ago either no no absolutely not you know i presume when when the time comes for something to happen to me that i will probably go back to Iowa to be in that community but uh well it's good that you know that you have that option available um that because i don't think that too many communities have something like that set up but it's the type of thing where i think we should look at some things that are working and try to use them in the cities also um-hum i mean is there some reason why some of the churches here could not band together and do a similar situation probably not um and it might even be easier here in that there are so many more churches available more people to draw from yes and actually a great deal more money well yes that's for certain my my mom lives in a small town also and i know you know the funds just aren't available uh to do something in a small town that you have that you can do in a larger town but um uh you know other than care conditions you know i don't know really what else a person looks for uh convenience for the family would be a a wonderful thing uh but that's that's you know that's not always an option either right but you know if my family if all of my kids still live here and i go back to Iowa course there is no convenience so probably it would behoove me to try to start something of this sort here in Dallas um-hum but uh that's a big job you know uh so many needs are crying the homeless the abused children the the beaten wives you know there's so many things going on that that how do we all of this and maybe that's a part of it maybe maybe what we can do is uh of course this is kind of a far flung situation but uh you know they're talking about work fare now in uh Wisconsin i believe it is but is there some reason i wonder why we couldn't have some of these people involved in nursing homes um-hum is that so that they didn't have to be so expensive you know if you if you've got somebody who is drawing welfare then perhaps that can be quote part of their their payment for their welfare payments um-hum well and i think that would be a good idea too i don't know if these people need it for self-esteem it would seem to me that they would but if nothing else yes let them earn some of their money yeah because part of the problem now is that it costs so much money to get into a convalescent home or or an aged home um-hum you know it's almost prohibited for many persons and uh you know so what do you do does someone go on welfare in order to get in one of those homes or does somebody in the family quit their job so that they can be at home and and but of course that's not always wonderful either because somebody with Alzheimers needs twenty four hour watching and nobody can do that um-hum that's right that's right i well i guess that's probably as people get older for nobody can do that  have you any thoughts well you called here so okay well um i'll tell you i am uh uh impressed with the uh uh amount of spending that's occurred so far as as far as AIDS research and i think that uh proportionately maybe uh so far it's been enough it seems like it seems like uh but there's not uh been any money taken away from uh other necessary medical research uh uh subjects uh you know and and allocated towards the AIDS research i think that AIDS research has been a a a lot of the funding has not been done by the government a lot of it has been done by private endowment uh but i think the government is doing a good job so far of keeping the uh their portion of the funding up well i um i agree to an extent um i think the problem is is that we're spending money and one of the things that the government likes to do when they're under public pressure is to throw money at the problem um-hum in an attempt to try and solve it as quickly as possible and they did that with the Pentagon in the eighties and when you have a lot of money in your budget and you don't wanna have it cut back you spend it even if it means throwing it away um-hum right and i think that while we need to spend more effort and money on things like education and maybe even alternative treatments and alternative experiments things to keep those afflicted alive at this point um-hum i think that any money that is given must be given carefully just to something that is a proven point not just thrown at it um-hum um i i don't see that the money is being removed from any other causes um AIDS has been a problem though especially in the eighties when there wasn't a lot of private dollars around because of the stigma of the disease uh-huh and that people really didn't groups didn't wanna be associated with it because it was a morals issue right i think we're finally getting over that i thought that was ridiculous reading and hearing about that kind of moral dilemma stuff but i think that it we need to spend a lot more on education and try and get over this thing that we have about not confronting this head on with some factual advertising for items of condoms and things like that that um-hum will help prevent the uh disease as well as instilling the notion that the best way not to get it is not to involve yourselves in unsafe practices in the first place exactly um it although i was uh i i was shocked at the public um uh outrage uh that occurred after after i uh think it was Dan Quayle who said um you know who suggested that maybe maybe we you know maybe that is a a possible and and uh uh likely most effective solution is you know abstinence and and yet the a large portion of the community said well that's stupid you know that just shows that you have no interest in in in spending any money on the on the problem and i thought that that that that that's not that's not the point at all well the the problem is that with this administration at least when they say abstinence they often couch that in other things that turn into one of these morals issues which uh makes it turn into a political issue now you see the problem is you have people in the National Institutes of Health in Atlanta and the like the Centers for Disease Control which um-hum have fundamentalists in charge of the thing who won't even let you say condom in a meeting right and these things have been spread around and immediately immediately people think well abstinence okay here we have these religious zealots telling us where they're trying to ignore the problem blah blah blah and of course they overreact when you say that the fact that it's just good medical safe practice you know don't expose yourself in the first place um-hum um-hum but the it's because the the the you know this administration was around when Reagan when the disease first was discovered here and all the social you know implications of the Reagan administration ignoring it when it first became an issue and um-hum see that's all carrying over now right and that's why you're seeing that okay that that makes a little bit of sense uh i i hadn't i was not aware that that was uh such a a within the NIH that uh that was that much uh yeah there is because what happened is a lot of these people and staff members are political appointees um-hum from the south especially who come along with a variety of different religious beliefs some of which held very fervent beliefs and will take their beliefs into the workplace in and in this case a lot of people consider that to be standing in the way of science and medicine to try and solve this thing um-hum um-hum but i i don't like throwing money at the problem uh because  um well i'm just really excited about it because i'm graduating from college next month and i hope to be buying a car sometime in the future uh-huh so so hopefully uh maybe do you have any good advice do you have a car or uh yeah i do have a car um-hum uh right now i have sort of a sporty car it's a Subaru that is it's called an XT6 i don't think they make them anymore i think i have the last year uh-huh and it's one of these Japanese cars that run without needing many repairs um um-hum my advice about cars is uh get a good engine get something that goes not because i'm a speed freak uh something because if you want to get on a highway you don't want to step on the gas and and say come on come on um-hum that's true that's true i do you know they make jokes about women picking out the color but i really do like to have a decent sized engine in my car and i have a six cylinder and it does go when i tell it to and and i just like the looks of a kind of sporty car um-hum uh i think my car needs are going to change i had very small children and i was saddled with a station wagon that i never wanted oh um i was told that you know it'll hold groceries and all this stuff well the grocery bags fell over in a station wagon that's true they do my mom has one you know and and you know and i wasn't that thrilled to put a bike in it or a dog in it and i didn't so when i got a new car i got a sporty little car and my kids were still small enough but they weren't in baby seats anymore and they sat in the back um-hum and now my son is fourteen and a half and he's taller than i am and every time i go over a bump he crashes his head because oh oh no you know these cars have they're backseats but they're kind of toy backseats yeah yeah so i think should i get another car uh much to my chagrin it'll have to be something more boxy um-hum and you know practical again so this i guess i guess this is my reprieve and i guess my suggestion to you is to get something you really enjoy because at some later date you'll have to get something more practical that's great advice i'm so glad i got to talk to you that's good that's what i needed to hear yeah i guess i'm looking for uh something kind of small because it's only me and i'm a small person i'm only about five one so uh-huh um and i'd like to get something made in the United States so i would look for that first but if it turns out that a better price is from say Japan like the Subarus then i i would go for that because the most important thing is price i mean because well you know the more i think of it you know with what's going on in the world nowadays i think the next car i would try to buy an American one um-hum would you really yeah i think so it's you know Toyotas and all those they're they're nice cars but you know surely there's an American car i i'd love to check out the Saturn which is supposed to be a new newly made American car yeah you would think so um-hum actually i heard really good things about them and uh it's funny because i just spent last weekend i was down in Washington DC visiting my sister and they are everywhere down there it's amazing because you hardly see any of them on the road here in Philadelphia but i saw about ten in one weekend and uh my sister had gone to the dealership and she was really impressed she uh the one thing that really impressed her which sounds kind of weird but they actually have women salesmen it's weird because i mean have you ever seen a woman car salesman oh yeah i have really because i was surprised but and she said they were really nice and one good thing about the car is it's really hard to dent you know when you're driving a car and you you go in a parking yeah you know most cars in a parking lot like a cart shopping cart hits it or a car door hits it and you have like these dents well the lady took a hammer to this car and it didn't dent is it really huh she was like smashing it and it didn't it's it's made of something i don't what it is but really how was the pricing it's actually supposed to be really good the smaller ones i think around are eight thousand and then it gets up to maybe twelve thousand oh that's that's not horrible at all that's quite good nowadays so they they look really nice yeah yeah so i don't know maybe that's something to think about because they're supposed to be completely made in the United States not one of these deals where yeah it says it's made in the United States but the engine is really made in Japan and all the parts are made in Japan right parts are made in different places right i wonder who makes the the Geos because i think that's Chevrolet is it because they're so cute The Geo Storm is adorable um-hum that is really nice that's true i don't know anything about them at all do you know anyone who has one no no i don't in fact i i sat in one a long time ago and slammed the car door and it felt a little tinny you know it was it's a smaller lighter car i know yeah um-hum but you know that was years ago that was about four years ago when i bought mine so it may have changed i know on looks i think the Storm is just adorable little car for a single person hm yeah that is really cute that's true hm are are you working yet so um well i'm in ROTC so i'll be in the Army so on active duty so yeah uh-huh yeah because i was wondering if you're are you going to finance it probably yeah is that a good way to go i guess i don't know which one right uh well i have been fortunate enough to be able to just pay for it and i i like to do that but there are people who can pay for it who prefer to finance it uh-huh really yeah it it seems to me as you're paying interest you're bound to be end up paying more i guess now you have to think about uh if the money in the bank will get more interest right right uh then then you'll want to finance it but if now the banks are giving so little interest i imagine you might as well just pay for it if you could oh i see  okay um let me see i've been sitting here awhile i almost forgot the topic but uh it seems like i get most of my news from television i'm we only get the paper on the weekends and so i'm not much of a of a paper reader or but i i and i'm don't rarely listen to the um radio so it i get most of my news like from documentaries like Forty Eight Hours Twenty Twenty you know it the news at night um-hum news news in the afternoon and that kind of thing uh-huh well i i get a weekend paper as well and uh in addition to that i get a local weekly i i live in suburb of Milwaukee and they get they uh-huh have community newspapers around here so the local their extremely local stuff uh is in the local paper that comes out once a week and then i get the Sunday uh-huh uh Milwaukee Journal because i don't have time to read a paper uh mostly that's my difficulty i uh i get my news pretty much from the same source as you do although i do listen to NPR right which has very good and that's National Public Radio which has very good uh coverage of the national and international news i feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well usually huh um are you in the car quite a bit or no i'm not actually uh but i can run my radio in my office i i i teach at the university and when i'm not oh oh teaching if i choose to have the radio on i can listen to that station so uh-huh oh i see um how how are you are you satisfied with the Twenty Twenty and Forty Eight Hours and the things that you do watch yeah i i i pretty much am and i watch the news at least twice a day uh-huh so uh if i've missed something and and and i've just recently decided to home with my children and so it seems as if i catch the news rise right as it happens happens you know there was um-hum uh the explosions and that kind of thing my husband will say how'd you know about that and i said yes it happened at such and such time and that's so that that's different for me so i usually find out when exactly when it happens and that kind of thing is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is is the timely you noting noting of the events as they happen is that what you feel good about in the news coverage uh no it just seems like since i've recently stayed home that that is what's happened you know it's just that uh i now that i've stayed home i'm i'm usually aware of when when these things have occurred and it happened and uh-huh well i i myself uh the the reason why i listen to NPR and the reason why i watch MacNeil Lehrer rather than the than the network shows news shows at night although i do often watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which shows shows you know carries over a lot of the national news stories uh is that right right quite often it seems to me that the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis the local doesn't either but i feel that MacNeil Lehrer get a little more deeply into some some of the issues that are really current uh-huh and perhaps newspapers do that but as i said i don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper and frankly when i have read a newspaper i haven't noticed that kind of analysis either um-hum hum so um there's there is some danger to that of course too because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then you know how good is it but uh i like a little more indepth coverage and i think that's what you're maybe appealing to you too on something like Twenty Twenty or Forty Eight Hours right right it kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story that kind of thing um-hum yeah so um i'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world rather than simply being aware that yeah you know there that an event has occurred yeah i i like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture maybe because i'm easily confused by detail i don't know uh-huh yeah i know what you're saying so yeah but i try and catch most of those programs on Wednesdays and Fridays and if i miss them i try and you know i try and and uh tape them if i'm out or that kind of thing i try and tape them and so i can sit back and watch it and it's pretty interesting um when you have young children right um-hum so those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the TV set for awhile without interruption yeah well yeah plus i find i have to video tape quite a bit of things if i don't want any interruptions yeah that kind of thing oh you do uh-huh uh-huh when is your good watching time um it seems like ten o'clock at night uh-huh yes yeah that's what what unfortunately but that's that's what it seems like ten o'clock at night i have older children and getting dinner on the table i come from the east coast and i was uh-huh it amazed me when i got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time they still watch the news when New York  okay go ahead well uh a friend of mine actually works for McDonald Douglas in the uh in the space station program so i get to find out a lot of information about what's going on there and it sure sounds like oh sure that's going to be a really viable program if it continues to be funded at current levels uh-huh um they're they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things um i think one of the the big things that he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads and that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down here on earth including um some new pharmaceutical techniques oh you're kidding yeah so you know there's there's a a big opportunity for us to explore uh what sorts of things you can do in a zero gravity environment hm um-hum sure so i suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that well that's good because sometimes i wonder you know being a uh lay person out there of not uh knowing exactly exactly what's going on in space whether you know they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here being you know to me the all this uh space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth that uh we can't live on Mars we can't live here we can't live there i mean this is the the place that we have to live i mean there's uh no other resource for us to to look at other than here so it's kind of like to me i would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space and what it you know not that i want everything to halt and let's forget about the space program or whatever because we're always curious and we always need to know more things but um it to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here mainly because uh the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us i mean this is it i mean if we would've uh if we would have went into space and found Mars a livable planet uh planet we probably would have inhabited it and uh you know who would have cared about earth it would have been another planet to kind of take over and uh continue on so you know and that when i look at the space program itself i think of it you know as being in terms of it's it's interesting to learn but it's also it's it brings down the fact that this earth is it it's it for us you know what i mean right um unless technology makes the decision that we all are going to live in space or whatever but i would love to um go into the space shuttle some day and uh just see um you know the earth and the different planets and things like that i i think it would be very interesting to do but whether it'd be feasible to do i don't know well um and as far as the practical aspects go i suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise between you know deep splace i'm sorry deep space exploration and uh and not doing anything because um-hum um-hum sure we have the opportunity to off load some things to the space station exactly um-hum and uh you know perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that uh we'd normally do down here that are damaging to the environment um-hum exactly yeah that's true you know and uh i think of uh i i'm sure you probably have heard of the Genesis program that's going on currently out in the Arizona desert uh uh-huh there's uh you know they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create you know an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it and then they have an area that's more um you know full of uh vegetation tropicals that kind of thing to kind of uh look at things and say you know the environment wise this is where we're living but what what effects it and how can we improve it and things like that and i i think in space um i don't know how many people could live up in space uh for any length of time i mean i just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy out and it's cloudy for days and we don't see the sun and the people their moods are extreme you know it's like God if i don't get to see the sun i'm gonna be in this bad mood all this entire time i mean this is how i see people reacting you know when is the sun gonna come out right so i wonder how you know somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun you know in the aspect that we see it uh and never seeing uh you know light bright days you know and uh breathing right  i think that the middle east is of all the uh regions of the world the most volatile that we seem to be getting ourselves involved in and uh i'm not sure we're doing so with sufficient knowledge about the history of the area and um with what uh the people there expect i think we're just getting ourselves into a barrel of trouble yeah well i think we may have the knowledge knowledge of the history but certainly not any understanding of the history uh we seem to be you know doing the same we've done in many other cases which is sticking our noses in where it doesn't belong and i think it's you know motivated you know clearly by the fact of the resources that are controlled by the region which is oh clearly yes and um of the you know used up in the next twenty to fifty years there won't any oil any oil left i'm sure hum well i feel that as far as US policy's been concerned while i understand um a position in allied um friendship with Israel i think that we've applied a lot of double standards in the legion uh in the past as far as dealing with the Arabs versus dealing with the Israelis and the expectations that we put on the um uh Arab nations uh while basically succumbing to a very powerful Israeli lobby in this country yeah and i i think that the Palestinian question is a key to a lot of problems in the region and i don't think that this country's handled that well at all yeah well probably from there is that the same problem as anywhere else anytime you take something away from somebody and give it to somebody else um-hum that you didn't own in the first place there's you know going to be problems i mean that's basically what's happened i mean yeah basically a handful of nations took away from Palestinians what was their homeland and gave it to the Israelis you know to the Israelis and you know it's not the way to go about any kind of uh solution that's ever going to be workable you know i mean you neither party was consulted up front yeah yeah i kind of anticipate that because you know we set the stage and how we've dealt with that issue in such a poor manner by basically you know paying lip service to the Palestinians in the past hum uh i think that's up the stage for the end effect to for this uh uh revolution of Islamic fundamentalism what seems to be sweeping definitely through North Africa and uh within parts of the Middle East as well something which terrifies the moderate Arab states yeah uh well it's pretty scary anybody if you think about i mean any any time you get fundamentalists you know whatever nature yep and in power anywhere i mean they're they're pure fanatics and there's that you know fundamentally no way to deal with a fanatic and you can't argue with them on any sort of logical or emotional basis a fanatic will believe in X Y Z and you're never going to change that yeah i i suspect yeah you know so you might as well not even try i suspect that we'll probably in uh with the demise of the Soviet Union formation of Russia whatever ends up coming out of that um-hum that probably the biggest problems we're going to have in foreign policy are going to have Middle East in the future i think that we're going to continue to see a lot more fundamentalist influence in the area it's been spawning for a long time the more moderate states uh even including Saudi Arabia which is a very religious country Islamic wise it's not allowed the fundamentalist to gain control but uh i you know Tunisia and uh now we have problems with Sudan um-hum and uh these places i think that you know we're just in the beginning here of uh what will probably sweep through i mean Egypt's suffering the same kinds of problems with fundamentalism right now yeah the more nations that join with this kind of uh thinking in government the more stronger uh difficulty we're going to have as a nation in dealing with the region because of our past experiences with the Palestinians yeah i think a lot of it is is just rejection of the current you know power structure and that power structure happens to be religiously aligned and aligned with uh you know a religious based monarchy in a lot of those countries and that they're basically rejecting that power structure in favor of another which is you know return to a fundamentalist thing i mean it's not to unlike what happened in the United States over the last ten years i mean basically people rejected you know there's fundamentalist you know movement yeah wasn't quite as severe or as you know fanatically radical i mean because the uh the class structure is is you know less prolific here or less you know regionally defined here and uh the uh the differences aren't so so strong as in say talking about like Saudi we're you've got you know uh basically a ruling  have you had to return anything lately uh i had a uh i have a boat i live on the water and i i have a boat that i like to take out pretty much every day and i uh took it into the shop to be repaired and i brought it back and it didn't run and i got to i had to i took it back and told them what was wrong and uh uh took it back out and it still didn't run three times i had to take it back did you think it was uh the mechanic's problem with the bolt uh was a mechanic mechanic's problem he didn't really know what was wrong with it and you thought he had fixed it but he he not didn't eventually it got to the point where i said i don't think you know what you're doing i'm going to take it somewhere else and so i did and someone else finally fixed it you mean did you have to pay this fellow uh no i didn't pay him i wouldn't image you'd want to i paid him original money to do some other work that he did right but uh the rest of it i didn't um didn't pay him no thinking about products and have they really changed and uh i i think it's hard to say cross the board that you're not getting what you're getting what you pay for anymore i um just recently had an experience with Sears do you have that down in Florida yeah well Sears is kind of famous for taking back almost anything they're very good about it i had bought a leather jacket almost about twelve years ago for my ex-husband he is still wearing the darn thing and you know after some time i was fortunate enough to get remarried to a really nice fellow and i happen to like this leather jackets and his lasted about a year and a half and i said there there's no uh this makes no sense the good guy didn't get the good jacket and i called them up and i said i would expect a winter coat you know we do have in winters in New York and you i guess you use four months out of the year um this guy didn't get eight months out of a winter coat all the stitches were coming out it's a real mess you know i really expect you to do something about this and i didn't really hang on to receipts or anything and it it took much song and dance uh to get it done but i just picked up a brand new leather jacket today oh good so i'm i'm pretty pleased about that the thing is it only cost about a hundred dollars which for a leather jacket is quite reasonable but the repair i was going to just bring it in and have it repair the repair would've been about seventy and i was going to i was just going to do it i hated to throw it out so i i think if you make enough noise you can get your problems taken care of in most cases yeah so they took and just exchanged uh yeah i i had to bring it in i had to talk to people in Roanoke Virginia i guess that's Sears central but they were really good about it you know they i i wasn't nasty i didn't attack them i said i'm so used to your stuff being wonderful i'm so shocked and alarmed this should happen yeah and i think it's how you conduct yourself as well if if you're kind of mean and nasty if you you get treated mean and nasty yeah but um i was really please and and it is true uh uh generally they back up what they have and it worked out nicely fortunately and it's you know it's like you know when someone else hits your car it's not your fault and you don't pay for it but you're majorly inconvenienced yeah and i had to carry this jacket around to repair shops and make dozens of phone calls to get it fixed you know it's not like it didn't cost me anything in time and effort yeah but um yeah what aggravating is uh how much how much time and effort you expect things to be to be right the first time right well you you were talking about boats it made me think about cars i had a Ford station wagon that one day just died and i called up the repair shop apparently this some kind of uh box in the uh Ford car that just dies and they know it dies and in every car you're going to have that's a Ford car it's going to die and i guess after so many miles and he told me over the phone before he even saw that's probably what it was yeah and it is and and they build this little time bombs in so you know you got to bring it back a little black box that huh tells you when to bring it back in to to for repairs well some kind of part where you can't even an electrical spark off the engine anymore it just the whole thing just dies when you this thing goes yeah and you really don't know when it's going to happen you just know that you're going to be stranded if you get a Ford and that's not too not too nice it's kind of upsetting yeah at at the time i knew what it did and what it was called but i don't remember that now yeah have you found that uh clothes and shoes and things you bought shoddy than they have in the past uh well i haven't bought too much lately uh not for clothing um but uh i bought a a lot of stuff i remodeled the house and i bought a lot of a lot of new uh a new new kitchen and new uh fixtures and everything and uh one thing that we i did buy that i had the only problem was a Sears stove um and uh when i got it it'd a big dent on the top of it so i had to  okay i'm here how do you feel about the public schools well our public schools are are really poor i feel um uh-huh i'm not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation but uh we're toward the bottom yeah and uh there's a lot of things that i see that are so obviously wrong um-hum that you would think it'd be easy to correct but the system doesn't allow for the corrections right um-hum yeah how about you well that's interesting i have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw Georgia oh yes and uh she has a young boy actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there and she complained quite a bit about this school system there yes and and Cobb County is better than the county i'm in she was in Cobb County right right i'm i can't really say much about the schools up here i really don't come from here uh-huh i'm only up here temporarily on an internship but um i live in Orlando Florida usually okay and the schools down there from what i know are not bad they're pretty good well that's great but i know that in some i know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good um-hum for example i have a brother in North Carolina and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad um just terrible well i feel that we're way behind uh i have a son that is in the fourth grade and uh they have just now taken up division hm wow uh yeah and and you know i my husband and i go to the store and we buy these math books and and fractions and multiplication division things and that is slow i feel like uh there are several areas that we're just really really slow in and uh um-hum i don't blame the teachers as much as i blame the system it is what do you think's wrong to cause that well well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system and the money they do have they're not they do not use it wisely uh she my son's teacher has twenty seven students yeah um-hum and that's certainly is a lot of students for one person yeah to deal with on an every day basis perhaps uh but more than that i don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children yeah and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keep the ca class in an uproar and you're not at liberty yeah to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principal's office and it yeah that's that's one thing i worry about it you know it can you it can really be bad uh also i think we have a lot of uh Hispanics there you go uh-huh and we have a lot of uh uh the county i am i'm in uh the minorities are mostly Hispanic yeah probably quite a few black people up there and and no we're from a county and uh we're from the county they marched in we're in Forsyth county yes and we and there's very very few blacks uh so uh so that's um no oh is that right oh okay i i hate to say it's not a problem uh because i hate to feel like they are a problem although they are yeah but you know it it it's you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever but then again yeah there is no denying that it that but it is a problem uh especially in the inner schools inner city sure you know teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school well and you can't put all the children in special education uh and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done that's right you can't do that right you know see i grew up in Nebraska um-hum and the school that i went to there was fantastic it i i really consider myself very very lucky um we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking twenty seven thirty kids to class to a class yeah but your teacher had control but yeah we zipped right along you know i i was i was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily um um-hum yeah i i believe i was too um-hum but you're right you know with all this don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights you've also taken something away from the discipline i think uh-huh um well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school we just cannot afford it yeah right i was gonna ask you if there that was an option um if  okay um let me see unfortunately we are not much recycling we don't we don't do enough i know we don't so uh-huh uh although uh lately i've been uh a friend of mine that i spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit and it's it it's uh interesting to watch some of the things that she does and then she's almost had an impact on me um where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but i i can kind of tell it bothers her so uh just unconsciously i've i've stopped buying a lot of um um paper plates and paper cups and i don't do that anymore i don't know why i just don't i just from just from socializing with her so how do you uh how uh is recycling done in your community is it really it there's not a whole lot there really isn't uh i know in my mother's neighborhood in San Antonio each uh-huh each house has they're they're given three baskets and they put them out on a certain day of the week uh-huh right and each uh home does participate but we really don't have anything uh close in this area that that do anything and and some of the communities that do the residents are having to pay to participate in it which really doesn't make sense oh right over here they um have several private companies that you can take uh recycled materials to but um if you want to take them all to one place they have uh the first Saturday of every month they have certain places that you can drop them off that's what i do um and i i recycle aluminum glass um newspapers yeah that's good so it's nice to have you know one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place and yeah yeah that's another thing you have to go to different places to do that right right so it's so that's nice it would be it would be really nice if they uh came to the house to pick it up and they just were talking about a bill in Tucson about that but uh uh it didn't go through uh-huh but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that which uh i don't know it just doesn't make sense to me so right i guess what they what they were talking about here was um was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up or something you know um yeah yeah so i guess that's one option yeah that's good that's good i guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too like um um-hum have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods they have this little number now that tells what kind of plastic it is yeah no yeah i guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler oh i didn't know that yeah so now they're like marking um they're i don't know there's six seven eight different kind of plastics and they they mark on the bottom what kind it is yeah so i guess that makes it easy to recycle and then they're they're um trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them you know that are that are only made out of one kind of plastic so that that makes it easier i guess um-hum well that's good i i you know unfortunately Garland doesn't have doesn't they don't i don't know they don't do anything like that or i i you know i read those little slips that come in with your utility bills right or your uh garbage collection and they haven't you know talked about doing something like that where does your friend go to recycle she lives in Garland and i'm not sure where what she does but she's uh oh she's very very heavy in that and she takes her own bags to the grocery store uh-huh um she has no i really i really don't think she has any paper products in her house um yeah and just a lot of things i've learned off of her that to start doing and she does make a lot of sense just her whole house is like wow yeah i guess that's how it gets passed on you know when one person you hear it from another person and then uh yeah and then you and then you pass it on so it seems to be catching on uh yeah slowly but surely i guess yeah and uh my little boy has watches a program that was really neat i sat and watched him you know the Barney you know the little um i don't know if you know the little character Barney they had one uh on that kind of type of thing and how children can uh-huh can do that and how to save water brush you know when you brush your teeth turn the water off and it's really caught on and he's only four and he's really caught on wow that's neat that's neat yeah when you and keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing he has really caught on so that's really neat well when you start early i guess  you wanna go first no you can start okay um one of the things they talked about was uh did we did what do what do we think about a judge making the decision and i really don't agree with that um-hum i think that the trial by jury is better uh you know than even having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible i don't think that they could be objective in every case every time right you you know what i mean right there's there this this this topic is kind of moot um there there's no way we we couldn't survive in a system in a in a juror system in a trial system without a jury um yeah right one man can never be one man one woman can never be objectionable in every case that's it um every person has their opinions and that's why jury selection is often very difficult um well i i feel the other thing too uh they were saying uh you know what new ways could you could it you you know change the system i i really think that um we spend a lot of time uh going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal i mean if if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed if they have been caught you know point blank in the crime there's uh no question it's beyond a reasonable doubt right you all these things i mean you know we've gone through this uh over and over again right they shouldn't allow an appeal and it can go on for ten twenty years i i think this is a little ridiculous yep um-hum i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers no that's right i work for a law firm i ought i i i'm serious and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems that happen that exist in the in the criminal system today with plea bargaining right you know if someone is well plea bargaining plea bargaining is a different story well plea bargaining is something completely different that that actually prevents trials or or at least speeds them up well i know that's that's what i'm saying but i think a lot of all of the whole criminal system is messed up in in that regard i mean you know people who commit uh crimes that they i don't know how it works exactly but you know they get lesser sentences and i understand that the jails are full of people you know uh right right and that they have to do something but i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it hum you you know what i'm saying that we we don't have um well a lot of states don't have capital punishment right and um we do i i think they should i and i think if a person is guilty of taking someone's life and like you say it's it's there's no doubt whatsoever like drunk drivers that kill people and um you know all they they're caught dead to rights i i just think that that's they've they've taken a life and if they should pay for it with their life right right when you're saying as as far as the appeal um procedure is concerned we just have the case i'm i'm sure you've probably heard of Marion Berry yeah uh-huh um his final his last appeal was was denied two days before his sentence was up oh really so i mean his appeal was denied and two days later he got out of jail it uh for cocaine possession but um yeah that was absurd there was no there was no reason the appeal process should have dragged on that long for a six month sentence i know that the uh-huh and i don't know uh what what would you do to change it to make it better well uh the the only thing i can i was you know the the appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of um i like i said as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence that's absurd there's no way that could work oh yeah i i i don't agree with that at all um but imagine the guilt that person would have i mean it burned out is there's no possible way that you could um you know feel good about yourself if you had to do something like that day after day oh exactly exactly right no one would want the job no really not really um and you know like i said the you know everyone has their opinions about every case well would do you think people should have a trial if they're caught dead to rights like oh yeah i i feel that everyone is everyone is um entitled to a trial by jury that that that right should i mean supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you well i mean were there witnesses in other words you're saying that we you have to find out whether it's premeditated or what the circumstances were right right that you can't you can't remove the jury regardless of the case i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching a murder take place and you you'd still there's still mitigating circumstances yeah yeah well it's i i feel  see when when when you're with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good and and you know the pay's regular but uh well you know sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on and i i i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that uh anybody could get in uh in dealing in a with a large company is to be in a situation where you you get to know what's going on and maybe that's that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do what's what's your feeling about benefits what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company well since i'm kind of on the the older side you know i i i just feel like uh when i start talking about benefits i talk about i'm concerned about medical benefits um my um my husband works for McDonald Douglas and so my his benefits his medical benefits are so excellent you know that's really great um-hum you know i work for um Western a bank Western Financial um-hum and uh they don't let me know really about anything that's going on even some of the immediate things that i need to know i don't know it until the next hour and then all of a sudden we know we've gotten changes made we're changing departments we're changing policies we're changing doing other kinds of things which to me is is disturbing i mean i feel like if i i don't necessarily need to uh be involved since i'm pretty much on a low level you are you are right there you know i'm pretty much on a low level as far as uh uh the company is concerned but i i do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if if i had a little bit more information along that line well that i i well i i work for the government and uh actually i work for the FBI oh my gosh and uh and so well you know we we don't there's lots of things that we don't get told for good reason but uh but basically uh there's lots of things that that we should know about projects i'm an engineer um-hum you know i'm i'm a COTR and sometimes and i worked in the same lab with a guy and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years and we should've you know we're we're now collaborating oh and it didn't for two years we didn't and which which was uh kind of stupid and it it but uh but uh our organization is doing something else tomorrow on Monday uh we're having a for all unclassified programs we're we're having little tables put out in front of you know lab in the hallways and everybody all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do which i thought was kind of interesting and but yeah that is interesting but uh but that sort sort of thing but but if but just i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on exactly and and but of course most time most the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know and you know if you don't really count if you're not part of the program you might not get told for months or you might you know if it doesn't impact you directly or if your management doesn't think that but but regard to benefits you know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing in the private sector i would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid fifties was is keeping a job until you retire hm ah right uh and engineers are uh are baggage to most uh uh as they get older to to most companies and uh it's very much like the military it windows out you know you you think well boy i'm getting more money and i'm getting more responsibility i'm doing this but as you climb up that tree pretty soon you're the the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree um-hum and pretty soon somebody falls off i've i've fallen off twice in my private sector oh and uh and and you know i can get up i know it it seem to be kind of kind of scary you know because you think of um see my son's eighteen right now and he he's uh he wants to go into engineering and the the the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now is kind of open and he's interested in basically three different areas but uh it's difficult for me to to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that he needs to do his own course investigation and and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years um-hum yeah and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical i mean my um brother-in-law is like um i mean he's sixty he's not ready to retire but his company is is closing is um is uh closing up um-hum and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he what he was working on he's getting cut back and he's not ready to retire yeah he may be retired  uh i don't know do you want to start well i haven't uh i haven't thought a lot about government government universal health care i've uh uh worked for a you know private company that that provides uh health insurance although i you know they're they're like many are are increasingly working on uh cost cutting things such that at this point i'm not very satisfied with the kind of things that they're doing they gone to um-hum network doctors which doesn't include our uh doctors and uh only certain hospitals well hm network hospitals where they will uh same deal as the doctors that they will pay a higher percentage and pay more of the costs with if you use their particular ones that they've negotiated with but uh um-hum uh i don't like the uh seems to me that we're getting that that's kind of going towards the the socialized medicine in terms of of not having a choice in where where or when you want to have have your health care uh without the government being involved it's just a private form of it but the same kinds of of drawbacks i think uh uh what about you what what's your situation as far as um-hum yeah well um i'm a graduate student and so i get health care through the school um so i'm for health care purposes i'm a a state employee so we have the state employees union okay um-hum um and we have our choice of like twenty different plans with you know twenty different companies that operate in the state um and you know i'm on Blue Cross Blue Shield uh i guess it's uh comprehensive um and you know i end up i'm paying like five dollars a month for health care coverage you know um and then i pay another five dollars for dental um hm um-hum so you know for someone who's in a huge union like uh the you know all state employees it it you know yeah yeah it's kind of the issue is kind of moot but i look at my parents my father's um self employed he's an attorney um and right now i mean it's just him and two secretaries and he pays out uh yeah what is it forty eight hundred dollars a month for health care for the family and and the two uh secretaries you know which is yeah it's just it's extraordinary you know um amazing yeah yeah and so you know i look at my end of it and things aren't too bad but you know i look at at my father's side of things and they're horrible you know and i hear a lot of horror stories from other people too yeah um you know that they have to deal with horrible um you know PPOs or HMOs or something like that you know where you can't choose your own doctor and and you know um-hum um-hum and and uh you know it it uh uh the company i work for is big big enough that they can that they've got clout but i you know feel guilty and resent a little bit the fact that that for instance you people like your father that just leaves them worse off cause the the health care providers end up making up what what uh my employer doesn't pay them uh by charging more for uh um-hum other people you know so that that that doesn't seem to me to be a fair thing either and uh from exactly yeah no from what i hear Canada has a has a really a a pretty good system in terms of of universal government health uh insurance depending on who you listen to why there may or may not be longer waits than here for some elective surgeries but but uh um-hum in terms of the per person health care that they spend it's it's on the order of half as much uh as the as the per capita average in the United States i think and and very nearly comparable service and i you know i'm i'm willing to accept some some limits in terms of i think it's Oregon that just gone through a uh passed a state uh health insurance scheme where they had a commission draw up a very uh um-hum you know very detailed and stringent priority list of what uh of of the uh different procedures and the and their costs um-hum and prioritized in terms of the of the cost effectiveness and then just went down the list and said okay here's the cutoff point if it you're below this point then it then the the odds of it doing you any good versus the costs are just not enough to be um effective and we'll uh we won't pay for those things and uh you know i'm i'm not hm interesting  the biggest social change that i've seen in the last ten years is that i you know i'm only twenty four twenty five right just turned twenty five and ten years ago i can remember when it was not common to see two people in a family or household working and getting behind and uh running into economic problems the way things are today um you know today just to get by in many cases you have to have two people working in the middle income house just to stay with where they were in the seventies um-hum um-hum um-hum i agree with that and and it's it's really rough that's probably the biggest thing i've noticed well i'd have to take a slightly different thing uh viewpoint uh i'm uh thirty five uh and um uh to me it's something a little more subtle it it's just a prevalence of computer technology and uh everyday life i mean i can remember when everything was still done by by hand by paper by hand as opposed to computer generated paper now yeah um you know uh before uh you know when uh clerks in grocery stores uh actually had to be able to add things up and in their head and check it which is plusses and minuses there i guess yeah i remember when we were going to the grocery store when i was younger those big monstrosity cash register oh yeah yeah with the greens buttons the rows and rows yeah um-hum and it was actually quite and art form to see some of the you know older or or more experienced cashiers go you know fly through that is like those Japanese hippies see what the abacus is still yeah uh so uh maybe that's just a different viewpoint uh but uh i just remember everything well just writing a letter for for work you know i mean in word processor you know we can to me i can't even image now how they even produced books or letters before word processors you know then we'd have to through fifty iterations at least the way i write letters and things yeah i i found all through school you know you write your hand to death you go through pens and uh i'm actually because i have two computers here i'm actually loosing the ability to write by hand and feel comfortable doing it it's too slow i think the speed of the computer i think much faster because i can type much faster than i can actually write now yeah and i what happens is words will drop out of writing and i'll go back because i'm thinking so i'm thinking at the speed that i type on the computer right right and you know we didn't have that problem ten years ago and then we didn't have fax machines and we didn't have to you know press one if you want to be directed to the service department press two right yeah i you know i i i don't even write any more mainly because uh well i can type faster like you can and also my handwriting is legible i can't i can't blame it on that printer most of the time so it's it's incredible you know i remember i started on a Commodore sixty four in ninety eighty six that was my first computer and today i'm on a three eight six thirty three and it's too slow you know i can't wait yeah hey same here same here yeah we it's got to go faster you know well we're getting greedy i guess but uh well with regarding to your comment i i have to agree with that too there's a prevalence of uh of uh two income households that uh you never really saw before although i probably on the exception of that my both my parents did work but most of my friends parents when i was growing up hum the mother did not and uh it's simply not the case and uh to to keep the uh bank that owns your house happy the bank that owns both your cars happy and the bank that owns your credit card happy you do have to i think my wife in fact uh started to work part-time now because we'd started out we got married she had not uh uh wanted to work uh after we had our first kid and i said fine but now paying for these kids she's she's had to back to work part-time oh yeah up here up here in Rochester almost everybody works for Kodak or Xerox and ten ten years ago you were always assured of having a job um yeah i remember that and now you you know i my grandfather worked for his entire life for Kodak my father the same thing but now everyone's worried and and uh you can't rely on that kind of thing anymore everything sped up so fast and there's no more old-fashioned reliability in things anymore the way pace the pace has changed i remember when i got out of college which was seventy eight people said now if you get a job with General Motors or AT&T or IBM you're set for life um-hum not after AT&T's going to let go fifty thousand people i i'm uh constantly putting stuff up in telecom from the CWA the union there and they're letting people go like crazy it's just it they're replacing them with computers well you plus you know you know after the uh divestiture or well break up  i guess i guess by what you said you're you you don't feel you're uh privacy has been invaded invaded anytime recently no not really um uh the um the the only thing that annoys me is when uh people call and they uh you have solicitation calls um-hum probably thing that bothers me that's not really invading my privacy um right do you feel that yours is invaded uh nah i wouldn't call it invading my privacy by any means uh you know i would there there's a lot of times though uh you get those calls and you know when you're sitting at home wanting to relax or or whatnot and you know next thing you know uh someone calls and wants to sell you this or that and it's real hard to you to tell them you know that you're not interested or you do tell them you're not interested and they still keep asking you you know and and keep badgering you about it and that aggravates me but i don't know that you could call that invading of my invading my privacy because you know if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say look you know i want my name unlisted or i want my you know but but that doesn't work it doesn't uh no because they a lot of times they dial sequentially they get your name from uh if you enter any type of contest or anything um-hum um you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something you put your phone number on there they pass your phone number on to another company oh um or you um or or like the newspapers they just dial randomly or select and stuff they even call the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe and uh while i was subscribing to the paper i got so upset at them that they you call me one more time i'm going to stop subscribing uh-huh and the local the local local papers will nice just you ask them to remove your uh number from their list and um yeah you call up their regular during during regular hours their um they have a special department they'll take your numbers out of their list um-hum uh but the uh Orlando paper um yeah they they they refused to take you off of the list and they call every month hm and when you have more than one phone number you get a call on each number you have good grief well let me ask you about this here's something that uh has been kind of concerning me lately my fiance received a bill from a a Lord and Taylor company uh you you know they're a they're a department store um-hum she received a bill from them uh that she had visited some some store and and i think it was there in Florida maybe it was in Miami uh that she had visited a store there and uh they had this bill uh that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise uh over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise um-hum uh and the date that that she supposedly made this purchase she was in Denver with me for Thanksgiving um and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number um um-hum um-hum and and i've i've heard recently that uh uh that this is a common occurrence where people are using someone's you know they they use Joe Blow's social uh social security number uh and can uh potentially ruin someone's credit uh-huh if you know a person's social security number and their mailing address in and their mother's maiden name uh you can basically become that person uh person huh um if the purchase was made made mail order they should have a record of where it was shipped to and since it wasn't shipped to her address she could prove you know that it wasn't her um um-hum if it was some you know coming into the store and stuff then she would of had whoever made the purchase would have had sign some kind of um you know document and uh who yeah the signature um they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature and if they can't provide a signature uh you know they'll they have to eat the charge yeah well you but if the person has had their social security her social security number i'd be real concerned that they uh that she's not uh blacklist on uh Telecredit what is it it's Telecreder something um yeah because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there she probably won't be able able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle yeah well we got it cleared up eventually what happened uh  well what's your opinion on capital punishment well uh i uh i agree with it as long as uh as long as there's no no shadow of a doubt of guilt right i agree with that too i uh this this is probably going to be not a big debate or anything uh uh i am for capital cu punishment only for murder i mean you know i think they asked in the recording uh what in in what crimes but only um-hum if someone has murdered someone you know that's about the only thing but uh how is Georgia for uh capital punishment are they executing people or uh yeah yeah um not very often but they they do send some every now and then you know as what well needless to say Texas is uh probably the leader uh i we may have started you know capital punishment back up again and uh i think we've probably executed more people than any other state yeah um-hum um-hum but uh a case out in California what was it a week or so ago was rather interesting in how that uh they prolonged the guy that was supposed to be executed yeah and i just i can't see any real value in just letting these people live out their sentences um-hum yeah it seems a little bit ridiculous because of just the tax dollar it takes to maintain somebody that's hopelessly you know just uh violent um-hum and and uh it's doesn't make much sense how do you feel about insanity pleas i uh i i don't think it's much of a a reason for um i i don't think it's much of a reason to get somebody off a off the hook i mean like uh Jeffrey Dahlmer i i don't know i haven't followed that since you know it was on the news but uh you know i've i've heard that there might be some insanity there i don't you know i'm i'm not at all up to date on that but you know if uh something like that if it if you can get off on sanity insanity on something like that which i i believe you know there's a certain degree of insanity there but that's certainly not um-hum i don't i don't believe it's uh an excuse by any means you know well i had heard of a case out in California of someone who had murdered his parents or some sort of thing and they put him away uh in an insane asylum you know because he pleaded insanity and after he was in maybe twelve years or so they let him out he went out and he killed five more people yeah yeah i just don't so i don't think that's uh an excuse at all well i guess it's sounds rather heartless but i guess if they're that bad if they're that badly off mentally then perhaps it's just as well to to end their life um-hum yeah yeah aren't we cruel people oh i don't i don't think so i mean i just you know if i i think in Japan you know when crime gets bad they you know they take a few criminals out in the public square and they execute them and crime goes down you you you know uh so there's i think it i think it works since most people don't believe in being forced you know well i say they may say it's not a deterrent and perhaps it isn't but i guess i just feel if nothing else it's justice i know that if someone murdered a member of my family i'd want justice done and i'd want to see them punished for their crime yeah yeah yeah i i agree so i agree uh perhaps the people in the Middle East have kind of a good idea you know if you steal something they cut off your hand and and the punishment fits the crime yeah yeah uh-huh but uh yeah yeah i think that's uh not a bad idea of course there there'd be a lot of people that couldn't uh couldn't function for awhile you know until they got it through their heads that you know that was going to be enforced well this is very true you'd have to phase that one in slowly or i think or you would have use someone as an example and see how it worked a bunch of yeah but then you got to pick who it's going to be well i i was a little concerned i was going to get someone on the phone that was totally against capital punishment and in any conversation that i've had through this TI thing you know i've never met anybody that i got into a screaming argument with or even really disagreed with heavily but i thought this could be one you know it could be a very yeah yeah yeah  you wanna start or you want me to start well go ahead if you're okay personal interests in computers basically nowadays it seems like you can't get by without one everywhere i go it's got some kind of computer interface like pressing on keyboards uh pressing in personal identification numbers all the ATM machines things like that i personally don't own one because i can't afford one uh every time you look in a friend's houses and they show you their computers and all the knickknacks they have it seems like they go from their basic computer to all these peripheral devices like uh modems and fancy printers or lazy printers and fax machines and games that they like to play course i i was impressed by some of the games they have like flight simular game simulator for the different aircraft yeah well that's uh actually you might guess you could say even more than just a game it's uh similar to the one they use at uh for training very close to it i understand except for the bouncing around it well i have a i just got a i used to use a TI PC at work now i just got a 386 uh computer PC you using it mostly for spreadsheets or do you use it for like word processing uh well i use it uh in my business i have to uh tie into the mainframe and also into a uh minicomputer a 990 so i use a terminal emulation in uh talking to other computers plus word processing i do quite a bit of that and it's uh that's supposed one of the features of the the new one the 386 it's got Windows on it and so you can toggle back and forth between uh applications and you know get a get a lot quicker in and out used to be you had to log off then log back on the other application yeah i use a Z248 286 at work but it's basically to tie into the communications network then through our communications network we go to our mainframe on the base there um-hum and use the Unix operating systems yeah use their VI editor and we use um read on line news through it and we also have terminal emulations through IBM thirty two seventy eight um-hum and i don't know i just don't i don't even use the hard disk drive to to copy any floppy disks or anything like that i just basically use it for a a window into there to the Unix world um-hum yeah uh we're supposed to be getting a fifteen hundred minicomputer pretty soon uh is that IBM or is that an IBM type replace our 990 huh uh no it's a TI made 1500 it's a a minicomputer uh it's a newer version of the nine ninety which is one they had it uses uh Unix as one of the operating systems but uh i'm familiar with Unix commands like um copying files and compressing them things like that i just have a fun time using their mainframe at the base but well Unix to me i mean uh that System Five i mean that's pretty looks pretty uh user unfriendly it's like a different language all right uh it seems like they sure uh i got a lot of stuff to learn i haven't used it that much so yeah we can use System Five or we can use um C shell you know i like um i favor C shell over the other um-hum i think i think most of our users like Bourne shell because they were trained in it and they just don't wanna learn something different that uh that's a powerful force once you that's a powerful force once you learn something you you tend to wanna stick with it pardon oh yeah plus everybody in your office knows it and as the new people come in they kind of help each other out but you have different people with different backgrounds and they have a hard time sharing information that's like i learned uh DFM and PFM you know Professional File Manager which is can be used as a word processor it doesn't it does everything i need moves splits you know all that but uh doesn't have some of the little fancy stuff like underline caps bold i mean bold and all that so uh that's other than that it's you know perfectly suitable for most things i do yeah the disadvantage disadvantage of VI editor you can't see all those fancy things i have another thing called Q-Office from Quadratron back in California that people like to use but it's a very slow system um-hum and i understand it's only on like we use a Gold 9050 and that's basically their format they use for word processing and they're trying to push people into using either WordPerfect  so what do you think um well i think uh there's been significant change over the last couple of decades uh i guess i would say that one of the most um important changes seems to be um that the family the definition of family is changing a lot yeah oh yeah no doubt about it the nuclear family and just the whole downsizing approach right you know a lot of people are are are not having kids are not having kids as as early or as many right you know and that's yeah that goes hand in hand with some of the stuff that i had you know like maybe the whole emphasis on the environment and on social kind of a social awareness approach to where people are starting to think about pollution and trash a little more and uh and the ozone layer and things like that right yeah exactly it's really putting some constraints on your whole uh the whole lifestyle which is it seems to me it seems to me like um like everyone is lamenting you know the loss of the nuclear family and saying that it's going to be the downfall of America but to me um um-hum i don't know i guess that that's that's probably a pretty liberal view but i mean to me the the old um traditional nuclear family um seems to only work seems to work real well uh you know when uh husband is in charge of the family when he's working when mom's home taking care of the kids um-hum yeah and you know as soon as mom gets equal rights and she can work too then all of the sudden you know there's all these constraints on the family i mean face it it's basically yeah an old um you know religious construction so um it's it's sure yeah see to me it no i i actually i actually think um it's it's better the way it's working out i i think yeah i'm i think that when each person is is working that uh it makes for more it makes for like two dependent people yeah and two independent people who are sharing their lives rather than one person dependent on another person seems to me uh um-hum it could be i'm i'm kind of a conservative uh myself although i don't know i've got mixed views i come from a very very conservative family where there are you know it's like you mentioned you mentioned it's like you described the first time uh-huh um where the the husband's in control the wife stays home raises the family things like that however uh-huh i don't think that's a realistic approach anymore especially with the the rising cost of living and things like that there's there's almost no way you can make it with a one income family anymore yeah it just seems that way um you know regardless of the of the social impact or the the familial impact you got to think about just the pragmatic side of it in terms of how can you afford to raise however many kids one or nine exactly um with one income and it's never going to work i don't think um see i came from um a pretty conservative family too yeah but the uh thing is that it didn't work out and my parent's split up so maybe that's what yeah maybe that's what um influenced my view oh really yeah my parents yeah my parents fought like cat and dogs um they they did stay together finally and they've been married like forty years now but right right i know i know what you mean because there's there's a lot of stress in that kind of an environment where the husband's gone all day and comes home at night and like the wife is like the first thing she hits him with is all these problems you know so both sides are are under a lot of stress that way right right i don't know i was of course of course when both um parents are working the big question is you know who how how do the kids get raised exactly you know that's something my sister's having to face right now they've both got they've got working parents both of them and it's like they're always shuffling them off to day care right and you've got to ask yourself whose morals and whose values are being you know enforced on my kid exactly exactly um-hum you know they come home and start swearing like a blue streak wait a minute i didn't teach them that stuff you know one system that um is interesting that that we we may take in that we might be good might be good for us to take into consideration is um in Israel they have this you heard of that no i haven't where the kids are it's kind of like of like uh a community school i guess where you know all the kids um it's kind of like a boarding school i guess and they're but they're raised by adults who sort of act as um-hum their parents you know because i guess in Israel um you know that happens a lot too that the women are working and or in the army or something like that well um right um i don't know it seems that's kind of interesting seems to work really well and they somehow they um do it in such a way you know that they they pass on morals pretty well  okay uh well we just got our income tax return and i'm perfectly happy what about you well let's see um i haven't gotten mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff at um at home in the Bay area uh-huh uh-huh so i'm not sure how much i'm getting back but i'm pretty sure should get back a little bit since i'm still a student so not too much yeah yeah not too bad though but as far as writing checks out and paying taxes i think it's pretty high but i i'm uh you know i i guess that's where we have to be where it we have to keep raising them for to keep some of the things that that we have and yeah it it's one of those necessities of life that we all have to you know pay taxes but uh although it is kind of a pain sometimes though it's just scary though about you know how high are the taxes gonna be when my children are my age um-hum you know that that's that's scary too because it's not anything like the way it was when i was young and small and a child so uh-huh you know that that's a scary part too that you have to think about yeah and and like as as time goes on you know things get more expensive and because we're we're increasingly complex society that day by day things get more um things get more expensive as well as more complex um-hum yeah and you know taxes are one of the ways that help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society yeah i mean everything from you know from Medicare to um to Social Security to um to feeding the homeless to um to you know feeding the homeless to uh maintaining prisons to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that and it's now there's more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing and um-hum you know it's it's becoming a a large responsibility but someone someone has to pay for it and that's us yeah and then you find out about all these things about are your taxes you know the taxpayers are your money is your money going to where you want it to go and there's gonna be a special this week i i can't i can't remember if it's Twenty Twenty or one of those things where um i think it's one of the local news i think they're having an a documentary something about that about they're trying to catch some people about not spending your tax pay monies right and fraud and that kind of thing you know and that's kind of scary too um-hum and uh so that would be interesting to see i wanted to see that program yeah and and even even today it's like you know there's still a considerable amount of taxes that you know we're paying for but you'd think that we're still in this this this uh deficit state that we're still not able to pay off things just because i know the budget's not big enough as it is yeah and makes you wonder when there's you know uh countries out there that have you know tax rates also like close to fifty percent or higher um-hum you know it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you can get it and that that's kind of a scary thought and i hope it doesn't come down to that um-hum yeah but on the other hand they also while while those countries that have high taxes also have things like um like socialized medicine and things like that too which are nice fringe benefits of it so everyone has everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors that sort of thing and it's good but it's it's the price they pay um-hum yeah i mean it it can be argued one way or another whether the economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those those countries tend to be um as far as cash flow a a lot um have a be tend to have a much slower cash flow and don't try and generate a larger um um-hum a large amount of revenue because there's so little um currency flow through out the economic system hm well you sure do know a lot know a lot uh just keeping up with the times that's all yeah yeah as it as it turns out you know it's one of those one of those interests that you know i kind of like to keep up on because well it's nice to know that when i'm actually you know i do start working that i'll like to know like where my tax dollars are going too i work hard to to get you know i like to know where it's going to um-hum yeah yeah that's true um-hum what do you think about these items that are gonna be um taxed even more like um tobacco and that kind of thing i think in a in a way it's good in a way it's not um but i think in general it's probably good i mean a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that have been have been in the past um-hum um have been not taxed because there's been such a large lobby against them against the taxes for them you know sponsored by alcohol and tobacco companies um-hum um-hum and it's things like tobacco are um they're they're a proven health hazard to smokers as well as nonsmokers yeah right and it's as far as a safety thing in like in San Luis Obispo for example there's an ordinance which states that um there's no smoking in any public areas and so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere oh really um-hum  well my basic idea on dealing with the US budget as unrealistic and as it may be is to first of all put an end to these kinds of uh hidden user fees and uh um other types of uh tricks that have been used to help mask the size of this thing let's get a hold of what the real true sized of it is and then let's deal with it immediately and as quickly as possible even if it means some short term higher taxes to get it down and uh then let's try to make some reforms with the the congressional community ha ha try and make it so that we don't have this problem in the future well i have to i have to say that i would be very in favor of a situation where the revenue generation activities of the government such as the IRS are monitored and spending for year X plus one can go no higher than the revenues brought in during year X you know so that uh forget about this balanced budget this would immediately force them to say well geez um you know last year was a bad year and we've only got you know we only took in two hundred million dollars uh i realize that i'm off by a factor of about five but we only took in two hundred million even though this year is going better we can still only spend two hundred million i i just keep seeing unfortunately the problem a lot of the problem why we have this deficits balloon especially during the eighties is just because the American people bought into this notion that well we can just uh we don't need a higher taxes certainly not they get enough of our money already and the deficit doesn't seem to affect me in my daily life and routine so so what it's going to affect your kids yeah i know but you notice these people are only now starting to think ahead well i i think this has always been the case with the American public in that it's made up of a bunch of special interest groups it's only recently that special interest groups have started to exert more power um-hum uh for instance retirees they've started to up social security benefits it used to be so social security was just the final safety net yeah but it's not that way anymore uh now you've got people who have uh sixty thousand in tax free income because they invested wisely during their working years and they're still collecting social security and all of that money is tax free um-hum i'm sorry i think that um all of the investment income regardless of how you invested should be taxable and the thing is that you should loose social security benefits based on how much income you have yeah the only the only problem comes down as that a lot of people will scream and yell especially the AARP because they were yelled that well we paid for this all along was this a hidden secret tax the whole time that's our money that they don't want to give back to us now uh yeah i i i i agree i think that social security ought to be done away with and put into the uh tax um-hum and that's what it is so go ahead and put it in there and uh uh you know i mean they're treating it as a tax they're treating the money as tax revenue it's not something that they're putting aside for later use it goes into the general fund whether or not it wants to to go there that's that's were it goes and it's being used so i mean um uh my personal opinion out here in California we just instituted term limits on the uh Senate and House for the state legislature um-hum and i don't know whether it's going to have uh the affect that of course all the the career politicos here say oh my God you know you're going to have a bunch of amateurs running the state legislature well well so what they can't do any worse than the guys that are in there now and well yeah we have that out here in New York too you know with governor Mario King Mario and the legislatures are opposing parties are controlled by opposing parties which means basically every year we have a scream and terrified over the budget yeah in this state which is delayed eternally and then they want to kill each other you know well i think that what we may end up with with the term limits is you get more people involved in government um-hum you get more people seeing how it should work and i think what that will do is that will allow people to say well wait a minute we've got to compromise we've got to work on something we need more of a vision and less of uh God i'll grab my money and do everything i can  are they doing a lot of recycling out in Georgia well um at my uh workplace they are we have uh places for aluminum cans and we have uh everybody's been issued a separate trash can for uh recyclable recyclable paper let's let's see them get that word straight uh uh-huh as far as the community goes uh it's pretty much voluntary nothing's been done um i don't where i live i live in an unincorporated area and we don't have any uh we have just private uh garbage services and uh uh as far as i'm concerned i i guess i should do it but being lazy i don't if if somebody made it easy for me to separate my trash and pick it up i would more than gladly participate uh yeah i it it is it is to some degree inconvenient i'd have to say that um uh around here they've given us mine already got run over um it it looks sort of like a milk crate a little blue milk milk crate and i have two kids and it's not big enough it's it's kind of it's kind of silly and what you do is you put out paper like paper bags and newspaper and cardboard and that you put separately and you also put out in this little ridiculous container any cans or bottles you have you know like your Campbell soup cans and your milk cartons and that kind of stuff hm and then the rest you can just you throw out and the town picks it up i've heard of communities where you have to separate your garbage and then put what's left in a clear plastic ga bag so they can kind of look and see if you're throwing out what you shouldn't i thought that was pretty amusing have the garbage police looking after you i guess i imagine i don't know uh well i used to live in California and um just before i left they were um some communities were making that uh mandatory and uh um fortunately i was in a i was in an apartment complex and for some reason we just threw everything in the dumpster that was all right well you know it's funny we just got back from a trip to California visiting some friends uh near San Francisco and San Jose and we'd see these signs on the road that said garbage pickup two exits down or something the apartment for the apartment dwellers they didn't make it easy to recycle at all what they did was um you would bring it to this garbage place that they designated and the Lions Club or you know some community organization would do you the favor of picking it up from there you really had to go out of your way to recycle yeah you know and most people probably don't wanna carry a couple of bags worth of garbage in their car a few miles uh i mean it's all it's a good idea we should all do it uh but um if it were from a practical viewpoint from a selfish viewpoint if communities made it easy and convenient for you to do it they would have a lot more participation in my opinion well around here i it's not too bad because on Tuesdays you put out your paper and your cans and and plastic things and they go away so that i mean that's not too tough to put that at the end of your driveway yeah right uh my friends in California have this special garbage fill where they collect all their soda cans and they kind of leave it near the dumpster knowing that the neighborhood kids will grab them because they can sell them or something for recycling uh-huh oh gee you haven't so they just leave it out for the vultures to take gee kids around here i don't think would pay well wouldn't pay any attention to it they'd the dogs would get to it before they would i would imagine oh well the soda cans where i live are good for a nickel a piece wow so if you bring them to the local supermarket they have these can crushers and you know you throw all the cans in one at a time it takes time a lot of time and uh you push a button and you get a nickel for every can because someone you had to pay a deposit on it when you bought it oh and you find these old old men and these bag people collecting all these things and hauling them in in big garbage bags and they just like take up one of these machines to to get you know couple of money uh bucks for beer or something is that a city or state law that uh requires it to be recycled or yeah it's a state well New York state does it and i know Vermont a lot of the eastern states do it huh so you get a lot of old people one old fellow had crates of beer he made friends with a bartender a bartender at some bar and he gets all the beer bottles because the guy can't be bothered with it and he said he bought himself i said that's pretty heavy for you isn't it and he says well i just bought myself an old station wagon to cart you know this is a real business for him he's making big bucks gee well i i guess if you can buy in bulk it so to speak well i guess at a nickel a shot if these people are retired and they've got nothing better to do i mean they can come away with ten fifteen dollars at a haul i guess well i bet that's resulted in uh it it would seem to me that's resulted in some cleaner highways i would imagine well you you do find people picking through the garbage pails at the beach you know my own kids have been guilty of that till they found that the bees were attracted to the Coke cans and that was the end of that surprise surprise i think it's a fair you know for an eight year old to get three dollars it's like wow gee well that's uh well that you know a state law like that would probably encourage people down here uh to do it uh i mean i i don't know  um basically what do you do to get your news well most of my reading tends to be professional reading so uh scanning headlines in the paper or reading over my wife's shoulder tends to be about the only newspaper stuff i do uh and the newspaper is pretty much for local news anyway uh when it comes to national or statewide things uh i keep uh the National Public Radio station uh um-hum that's available here uh on all day and uh that's pretty much where i get my uh both uh statewide and and national news coverage together with uh a little bit of TV news in the uh in the evenings um-hum but primarily from from radio uh which is you know that's a dosage of about uh about two two and a half hours of news a day depending on how long it takes you to get to work well well i it's on in my office and i can i can hear it as i'm working when i'm here my commute is is about fifteen minutes uh so uh uh oh okay um-hum you know that's not an issue but that's primarily you know where i end up getting it from and and that for for me is as much a a a choice because i find it to be a good way to do it as it is a response to limited time for doing reading and stuff um-hum it's probably more because i just enjoy the coverage than it is because i don't have time to read the paper you know um-hum well do you find that they uh tend to after a certain period of time broadcast the same thing over and over well they do to some extent i i hear some some repeats between uh uh The Morning Edition and the All Things Considered in the afternoon uh i we do also have a repeated an intentionally repeated coverage they start at five thirty in the morning and uh uh they play the first you know hour again over at the tail end of the broadcast so that people who weren't up that early still get to hear it so some of it is intentionally repeated and and so once in a while i'll hear the same story twice um-hum or in the afternoon i'll hear the same report from the same correspondent in Yugoslavia uh that they played in the morning so there is to some extent some repetition uh like that um-hum uh but uh for me it's better than trying to read uh Time or Newsweek or or US News each week i tried that once and uh when if i have something to read i feel obligated to read it um-hum and uh then i felt guilty because i never had time to read everything that was in them and so you threw the magazines away and wasted your money and yeah that was that was about it you know uh so now i'm saving trees and and uh by by not publishing subscribing to the magazines anymore but uh uh well how do you do it well basically i get i listen to ABC in the morning uh on the the Good Morning America and while i'm getting ready for work and other than that occasionally um i'll catch some news when i come home my husband's a big news fan and he'll always have the news on but sometimes i'll get involved doing some other things and um newspapers maybe on the weekend but during the week i just really don't have the time in the morning to get it uh and i'll listen to news on the radio but just in the car radio going to and from work in between music uh see here we're in in mountain standard time and uh well the few times when i've run into shows like Good Morning America uh they've really been at the wrong time for me they seem to start very late for us and i got to be at work you know i'm leaving the house at like seven fifteen and so uh uh um-hum the some of them seem to be you know like they don't come on until seven or something and and so there's not enough time and uh to to watch it but they have so many other things that are thrown in that you know i really don't care about you know how to make baked potatoes or or whatever uh or or or weather men with funny hats uh wigs you know that's another channel you well yeah but they they all the morning ones have a tendency to do a little bit of that well this is true they wanna put a little humor in there and uh you know it's mostly just the timing they seem to be on so late in the morning that i i started wondering to myself you know so who is it that watches these things but i think it's because of our particular time zone uh it we don't go on daylight savings time and so everything gets shifted by an hour that may have been when i you know i looked in on it uh one time it's just uh you know for me a lot of what i look for in news is as much analysis kinds of things or uh um-hum sometimes human interest kinds of things that are a reflection of the news rather than just here's the events that happened uh i'm a real history nut and so  about you but i don't do whole lot uh i don't do a whole lot mostly i you know build stuff around the house uh kinds of things uh oh yeah yeah what what have you done that's um not too much put some chairs and cabinets and stuff back together and you know some book shelves and you know junk like that a little rack to hold the maps and you know mail stuff you know the uh stamps and all that kind of junk in to go hang in the kitchen yeah right well that's cool i used to do quite a bit when i was a little kid but um recently i haven't done much at all i i did uh i a while back i started refurbishing a piano we've had in our in our family for a long time it's an old antique upright oh and uh kind of started to do some work with and stuff sounds like a big project uh yeah it is and i really haven't had time to do much with it um it's a nice piano but it's just uh it's like uh like the intro said if you had more time and more tools you know but uh other than that i i haven't done a whole lot i did kind of make a coffee table out of a piano bench which was interesting uh-huh um and that worked out pretty well i actually gave that to a friend of mine since i really didn't have much use for it but uh so you you got your house then work out uh no we're renting a townhouse um so we're just and i just kind of had to have some kind of piddling to do all the time sure is that what you consider a hobby then for you excuse me would that would you consider that a hobby then um i guess sort of it mainly just you know i've all kind of have something all the time yeah yeah for me i don't know it's my brother is a is a contractor and he actually does quite a bit of carpentry and wood work uh-huh so i don't see him very often but last time i did we did some stuff he uh he had a job where he's putting in tongue and grooves slaps for a a ceiling actually and so i i helped him do some of that and uh uh-huh and like that but aside from that i'm a i'm a student at the University of Central Florida uh-huh oh that sounds good aside from my classes i don't do a lot of uh of woodworking per say i've got a lot of other hobbies but not necessarily that so yeah i i guess it's kind of depends what your how loose your definition of woodworking is most of the stuff i do is not you know carving or anything like that it's mostly you know sawing stuff you know gluing putting things together that sort of stuff right i actually would like to do more of it though i kind of get into it it's it's fun to get started on something you know and and actually have a project that you're working on you know yeah it's a lot of fun to have something that you're doing and uh you know it's when you're done with it there something there too right you you've actually created something and had input into it yeah and also it's it i don't know i don't know about you but it's kind of neat to see something that you can create out wood you know it's like woe yeah uh-huh didn't know you could do that but uh and also some of the the little tools and and techniques that that carpenters use um my girlfriend's father is also is also a contractor in terms of carpentry and stuff um-hum and he'd made her bed and i was actually taking a look at it and some of the stuff uh you could see the techniques that he used to reinforce uh the braces and things like that they're really pretty ingenious and i hadn't seen them anywhere else there were some some um timing Bruce slots there and some things some particular methods that he'd used um which were kind of neat and he's Vietnamese so i'm wondering if if maybe the cultural difference made a made a difference in the way he worked at yeah um i didn't ask him about it but i could be uh and seems like of uh stuff that people make with wood you know up until a couple of hundred years ago you didn't have a a abundance of iron or steel to join them together with right yeah they had to kind of use some uh some different renovative kind of techniques to do that with yeah where do you where do you live again uh the Washington DC area okay so i'm thinking that's primarily pine trees for the most part in that area uh not too bad it's about i guess half and a half pine trees and various hard woods of you know i'm thinking if you were to do something what kind of wood would you most likely use over there and i guess uh really you can get any any wood that's available but i'm thinking in terms of cost pine pine would probably be cheapest there yeah yeah pine or possibly oak maybe but pine definitely yeah oak is a lot better i think yeah yeah making pine seems hardly worth it because it's so soft yeah yeah it's real soft and and kind of pliable and that's that's not real good but uh it's easy to work with but usually it doesn't last because it comes apart yeah i used to live in a before i moved up to Minneapolis i i lived in a a duplex in Orlando and uh that had some work that had to be done with it some of the the door frames and things and uh i did a little bit of that and that was kind of interesting too kind of fun um-hum but uh for the most part down there it's it's once again it's pine or oak  um in Texas they do have the um capital punishment and um i i just i i'm probably one that has to agree with it too um there're are some things that go on that i just feel that i i just feel that that that that is a need i don't i don't know a lot of people don't feel that way either but i just feel that that well i don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state but California we just put somebody to death um-hum um for i think it was a double murder uh to be honest i didn't pay that much attention uh to the details of it um but it had a lot of controversy out here uh basically because in California people like to protest about everything um but i agree i believe that that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go um um-hum the big disagreement i have is that in California the appeals process uh is so extensive and takes so long that you end up spending a huge amount of money in like ten to fifteen years before you can actually you know put somebody to death for for a crime yeah yeah that is a consequence yeah and i mean that's that's ridiculous i mean if you can you know you you the trial is supposed to prove you know within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty and then they have appeals well that's fine but it shouldn't take more than a few years i mean i should think two or three years maximum you should be able to know and you should be able to either put the guy to death right or he's innocent i mean it's if he's guilty for for you know multiple murders or whatever the case may be you know right um-hum well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on but i i just feel that that yeah capital punishment needs to stay within the system not all states have them but i you know was that was that the i'm not sure if that was in was that the man that that claimed he was abused or yeah he was like um the the the defense the defense they're were giving given was that uh like his mother had had been an alcoholic when when she was pregnant with him and so he he wasn't you know mentally competent or anything else and that he had some he oh yeah yeah which is ridiculous and and the court found him competent um and he knew what he was doing and everything else i mean you know it was it was the best defense they could come up with yeah and how long had he been appealing appealing how long was that i forget i think it was something like twelve years or something gosh boy it was it was something really outrageous yeah boy well i mean and it seems like it it rarely does happen you know it's not it's not used that often you know at least here in Texas but i think it's something that needs to stay i really do yeah i think in general uh punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be i mean it needs to be you know it's kind of like the the the justice system in the United States is kind of like the dog poops on the carpet and you wait three months and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it yeah you know i mean there's there's no connection between the two right right yeah i mean you take these you know most of the people who are committing violent crimes most of them not all by any means but you know a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place um-hum um they don't really see past next week much less next year and to say you know well if i kill somebody then a decade from now i might face the punishment um-hum yeah that's not real it doesn't have any real impact on them my sister and i were wondering about this recently because a an old friend of ours in California this just happened about a week ago um her husband just killed her and we're wondering if that has an effect um-hum if that if something does capital punishment you know does it happen with that within that uh i don't know um you you mean would he be put to death for that right um largely depends on the circumstances and generally you know from what i understand it's it's only the most brutal types of things usually where it's multiple you know i think you're right if if they can say things like you know well he was just you know temporarily insane because of some domestic squabble then um-hum you know they'll they'll give him you know twenty years with with parole in in twelve or something like that yeah yeah and uh i have an uncle that is an attorney that defends uh people on  uh i'm of the age that could have gone although i didn't and uh i guess um looking back on it i tend to think it was pretty uh mostly a mistake uh-huh on the other hand um the more i learn about the history the more i see it was incremental uh decisions anyone of which was sort of understandable at the time um-hum and uh but on the whole i think it uh probably was the wrong thing to do how about you well i'm uh i i was just uh in high school i guess when it when it ended ended up being i was in the last last lottery um-hum yeah and i was glad it was over by then i've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there just because you know we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like right yeah you know we um those people that i know i worked with several that were over there and for some of them it was just kind of i don't know not so much a holiday i guess that's how they tend to talk about it but that they just kind of lived out in the woods and every now and then they'd go and shoot their rifles and then they'd come back and you know yeah but that they weren't really allowed to do anything i uh to me it seems like we only went halfway if even halfway yes yeah it's funny tonight i was um helping my kid with an essay on uh Stalin um-hum and i was thinking in the course of talking to him about it how uh in World War Two the personalties of Stalin Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war and actually when you think back on the big events of the war it was uh it was almost a personal struggle among these three uh i guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense um um-hum they're certainly all leaders and um and uh with their nations pretty pretty solidly behind each one of them yeah and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the uh early decisions in the Vietnam war that the uh people saw the cold war as uh you had to draw a line and and defend it otherwise there'd be uh they'd get you someplace else um-hum looking back it seems like that was only partly true that uh there might have been a better place to draw the line um i guess you can i guess you can say that a a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight um brought the cold war to an end but i don't think you can just fight anywhere just just in order to um call the bully out and beat him and i have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the Vietnamese war they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line beat them and they wouldn't come forward and uh we were wrong um-hum but i um you know the like how they said the more i hear about it the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable but the cumulative effect was to really get into a a hopeless situation where and as you say uh going halfway was probably worse than um committing um committing to a completely and um winning it whatever that would mean yeah well i i i think we did i think we did learn some lessons that we weren't uh we weren't prepared for i guess the best word is the atrocities of war yeah huh yeah uh i mean the other wars seemed like a valiant war i mean they you know they seemed like a valiant thing you knew you knew who was good you knew who was bad and it was a it was a traditional yeah the traditional battle of kind of good versus evil if you you know whichever way it is but in in in the Vietnam war it seems like it was well you're not you're you're the sides and the lines that were drawn were all confused as to who's good and who's bad and it's ambivalent yeah and uh you know the even it seems like even the people you know had the South Vietnamese the North Vietnamese and of course the Laotians and the Cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved but what about what about the domestic effects like i was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it uh possible and even popular to um criticize the government and they that pendulum started to swing um maybe maybe even too far uh to the point where um um supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on and that tradition is still i mean it's dying now but it's still alive as opposed to yeah yeah this Desert Storm stuff may have uh killed it but i think that was one of the biggest that you know the uh this domestic unrest that it yeah  what do you think well i think AIDS research should be funded more than it's currently being funded i think that uh people including i mean mostly the government but also you know a lot of Americans i think that it's a disease of of a certain population i meaning um homosexuals and and uh intravenous drug users um-hum right in fact it is very much a a normal person's uh disease as well i think that we should fund much more sure right i think i i agree with that to a certain degree um certainly on an absolute scale it should be i i think it should be funded more on a relative scale um looking at it in comparison with other problems and no it's not a big environment i'm not so sure about that however um yeah you're right definitely there's there's a definite um stigma out there that yeah it's it's it's limited exclusive to intravenous drugs users and homosexuals and um blacks or whatever um-hum yeah um-hum and that's not that's not the case anymore it may have started out that way even though there's there's still no proof of that actually the most recent um the that i've gotten is they're starting to look at um well it started over in Africa they're starting to look at i believe but believe it of monkey yeah the monkey i think yeah there was some kind of research going on and i can't remember what the exact uh gist of it was but something they hadn't considered before and it's like they now they're trying to go way back to the original first outbreaks of it to see if they can uh nail down what exactly it was yeah yeah but uh well you know you have you have a point about you know where there's other issues that that need a lot of funding too sure that is true um-hum but uh there's a lot of things that are funded and a lot of waste that can be redirected too i think that that again that uh oh sure yeah you know AIDS is is something that has to be dealt with by every person um and and not just in understanding that it's you know can affect uh everyone but in acting um in a uh you know sensible way to avoid uh the spread of this disease yeah um-hum well i i agree with that um-hum um the point i i wanted to make was just strictly the environment like right now they say we've lost forty percent of the ozone layer just last year um in in selected in selected spots and that's really becoming a really big problem but that's not to down play the importance of AIDS research you know sure right right um when you think about that importance you also have to consider that uh not only is AIDS good in and of it's own but it also uh has a lot to deal with um cancer and with mononucleosis and all the all the various diseases that affect the T cell from a and the and the when the white cells of the immune system because all fairly interrelated um-hum right right so i think research on AIDS would benefit all that stuff yeah good point um i i think more often should go into you know AIDS uh education yeah oh yeah you know commercials you know public service commercials um schools um-hum things like that but it seems a lot like they're almost covering it up at this point yeah which is ridiculous you you you really don't see a lot out there it's like coming up with plague you know no it's not happening yeah uh disregard the you know one out of two people dropping dead next to you you know right you know that's that's for sure i i like i said i go to school at UCF in Florida and actually that kind of hits home because that Kimberly Begajah that had AIDS uh and died from it she went to a dentist in Stewart Florida that's where she got it right right and Stewart's like three hours away from where i go to school um-hum right people i hear a lot more in local news about it uh more than that i had a couple of friends who went to that dentist yeah interesting yeah and they were definitely sweating bullets there for a while um and found out that they they were negative you know they didn't have any problems but um uh-huh right you know boy talk about making you think twice before you go to the dentist yeah or any health care practitioner at this point yeah i guess so yeah because they really the last article i read on that they still hadn't figured out how she could've gotten it from him um-hum because he he as far as they could tell he sterilized the equipment he used gloves he did all the the proper precautions um asides from telling his patients that he had AIDS um but still that didn't make any difference they still got it so they they're not real sure how that how that worked um-hum right but uh yeah i'm i'm a lot more cautious of that but  we're supposed to talk about if we agree on if we're paying too many taxes or if we're getting our monies worth out of the taxes we pay right i think it's kind of a loaded question i don't think anybody would say we should pay more i think i think most of us feel that we do pay enough no yeah i think here in Texas they're even running an ah a series right now on the news one of the news channels at night about they were like secretly um supervising people that were supposed to be working for a county here um-hum and they were hired by the state state so they were being paid with our tax money right and they weren't even doing the job they were out working on other sites not doing a thing on what they were supposed to do well i i think what's happened is a lot of these state and city jobs people feel that once they get them they're entitled to them for life and they can kind of take it easy because they're protected by their unions etcetera right uh during my college years my mom worked for the state and she got me a summer job and when i came in i'm i was just a little eager beaver and i went through whatever work they gave me and i found people sitting around me polishing their nails and they were downright disgusted with me because i was going to come and go but they were going to live there and they didn't like me you know showing them up and finishing stuff so what they did was give me worse and worse and ugly and uglier things to do so i would just back off but and you know that's what it seemed like from the inside um it's not that no one works i think what happens is it's a personality thing and those who just like to do a job well done get to do the work for three or four freeloaders right yeah who don't do it i think i i you know i think it's a cross section of humanity it's not so much all state workers i mean it's hard to generalize like that yeah i think that we pay enough taxes and i think that if if everybody would be honest with how they dealt with the tax money if we could somehow get the same um ability to get work done and and be honest about it with our tax dollars i don't think they need to raise it and i think they'd be able to handle with what we've got i feel like here in Texas we pretty much get our monies back out of what we pay i feel very pleased with what they do they've put in you know as far as the state taxes go i don't know about our federal money i think that's all pretty i hope that they're doing better with not spending so much more than what they've got but you know you just never you can't control that but in the state here they've put in bike trails they've got really nice parks here in Texas they keep their their their lots that they own that are green and stuff they keep them really nice um their schools here are really good and updated they've got computers in the schools i'm very pleased at least with the area that we're in with how they spend their money their their they don't tax us outrageously and they seem to really give us a lot for our tax dollars they offer community classes for our kids to go to that are just very minimal minimal costs you know just cover the instructor oh and um there lots of opportunities that you can take advantage of there are community colleges here you can take for just practically nothing um they just offer so much for i feel like what we pay in our taxes that i don't mind paying them at all apparently there's been a uh movement where i am i'm on Long Island which is a suburb of New New York City and um there's been a movement by home owners to try get their their home taxes reduced they feel their too high and there's all kind of review boards that if you feel strongly about it you can challenge your tax uh the newspapers now running an article on state universities which you know everyone kind of assume at least i did assume that you can get a good education and pay so much less than a private University um-hum and it seems to be more of an expose than anything i mean you hearing ghastly stories about kids who are taking four and five like five years to graduate because when they try to sign up for a class they're so over crowded they can't get in the class yeah so in order to finish all the uh requisites they have to just stay longer until they can finally get a hold of the class right that this this i thought was totally outrageous that they have teaching assistants well that's that's an old thing you know having graduate students teach undergrads but some of these people are you know from India and Asia and they don't speak English well enough for the students to understand now how could they possibly have someone teaching a class who is not fluent right and and i heard that that's true i mean that's i find that incredible that's a so you're not as pleased with your tax dollars and what they're doing in New York uh yeah well i guess i have a a private um argument argument with them i'm a substitute teacher who you know have have has raised a family my kids are older now and i'd like to work full-time and they're firing teachers left and right and the classes are getting bigger our school budgets are really down yeah maybe it's not handled real efficiently you know that's that's very likely that could be i don't know um my you know my husband's in the computer business and the schools just you know they're updating computers are the hot new thing and my husband was  uh i don't know i can't give uh too good a perspective uh how things have changed in ten twenty or thirty years well i guess uh i guess the first thing you know comes to mind would be how they've changed to the worst yeah how so in a lot of ways yeah well yeah i guess break down of the family unit for one thing um-hum the uh astounding drug use that's uh going on and yeah pretty depressing if you start thinking about it i guess yeah it's uh i don't know it's you know i lived in basically it's a suburb of Washington DC um um so i you know luckily i'm in a good area so you know i don't have to really deal with a lot of the problems that DC has to deal but uh you know yeah uh kids are you know kids are bringing in guns into the grade schools and high schools and stuff you know trying to kill others kids and you know it's it's it's outrageous you know unbelievable like like you hit the nail on the head probably that all comes from you know lack of a good family structure for this people you know they just yeah i don't know which came first i don't know i think the drugs had a lot to do with it but yeah yeah i don't you know i don't know if that's a cause or an effect yeah that's that's the tricky thing trying to separate figure out which is which um but i don't know you know it i don't think there was much of a problem until crack started hitting the streets really yeah yeah because that's cheap and incredibly addictive and uh you know that seems to be the target choice of the you know poor inter-city people cocaine and marijuana i don't they really were after that i don't think they really touch that that much however on the brighter side cars seems to be performing a whole lot better well that's true that's true uh would kill for a dodge viper a the moment uh a pretty nice car yeah uh the uh why the computers in the engines you know they uh compensate the whatever problems come along until i just um-hum i make six and i'm a bitch though yeah it does i mean uh but uh i do have a lot a lot help with those computers you know the curves giving a lot of information diagnostic yeah yeah but doesn't uh help the home mechanic that much unless they've got a uh you know some way to decode all that information sounds like my wife's car i just got uh Cadillac a used one eighty six and um-hum had a few things she had to get fixed on it and we just so now you just pressed pressed a couple of the buttons up in the uh the air conditioning panel i think and uh and it reads out codes that way um-hum hum and then of course have to decipher them right with the little book i use hum interesting but uh yeah i don't know uh street gangs and all that kind of stuff just yeah i think it comes back to the you know that the family isn't fulfilling the role it used to yeah i i think that's probably the key thing you know the key thing so you've got single mothers who are trying to raise kids and you know are off working all day and the kids are on their own you know that much guidance they're going to get into trouble and you know now good stable family structure uh keep them straight or you know father figure to look up to or anything well they get so much information from the TV you know um-hum and uh makes i think part of the parents you know party and so forth and stands in the fact that they were you know able to teach them and tell them about things that and now the kids probably know more than the parents in a lot of cases yeah about somethings but i don't you know yeah for the more important things about life i think uh a lot of kids are missing uh right that's true they're they're out for the the quick buck mentality you know who they gets defined by what kind of tennis shoes they wear and uh you know they they don't have really kind of deep personal values anymore you know what  opinion on uh domestic or our policy towards uh Latin America is that especially during the Reagan now Bush administrations we seem to have a double standard in place over um how we treat them countries down there for example a left wing regime or communist regime is God awful and uh basically uh you know Satan incarnate while nations like for a long time uh El Salvador and uh uh Guatemala with with right wing regimes we kind of just winked at things like death squads and alike yeah we found Nicaragua to be the most horrible thing in the earth right and i just felt and it's the same thing with Cuba that we we really seem to have this kind of double standard down there whereas if your regime doesn't want to bother us a reason of threat to us we'll kind of ignore you you can do whatever you want but if you invite the commies in you know look out or if it it doesn't even have to be commies if it's just a little left of uh of uh what the prevailing attitude is in the United States it was bad somehow and um certainly the right wing death squads were just as uh deadly if not more so than anything set up by any of the left wing governments uh and and that uh showed in the uh who allowed to to come into this country um-hum um if people are coming from left wing countries uh it was viewed that they were uh only seeking uh economic uh benefits and not actually escaping uh death threats whereas if uh they were coming from right uh am i saying this correctly or if if if they were coming from um right wing regimes um you wouldn't want them in we wouldn't let them in yeah yeah yeah it's like Guatemala how many Guatemalan and El Salvador refugees have we seen and heard about in the last ten years yet Nicaraguan refugees for the longest time were welcome with open arms as escapees and um-hum and and any communist type of regime down there i mean the whole the whole farce in Granada oh gosh what an embarrassment right was it just i mean it was the most ridiculous thing and this is the kind of policy that we have down there i mean then we have this fake drug war no with uh down there and that seems to be well we'll give you aid but oh no not to feed your people no we want you to clean up uh our drug problem for us here's some money go shoot people with it you know right what was the whole thing with Panama i mean here we were paying uh Noriega for years and and then suddenly we go in and bomb his country and uh in Panama and and and try and indite him i i don't understand what that was all about well it's the same thing that happened with Iraq for years and years here we are sending money over here playing these people off of each other it's was same thing in Iraq playing Saddam Hussein off off you know off of Iran in this case Panama off of Nicaragua and uh Cuba and any of the other left wing regimes down there here we are giving them all this money and they're crooks and then when they don't do something that's suitable to our particular policy we have to go and invade them and uh and for what what does it leave us with absolutely nothing i mean it wouldn't surprise me it wouldn't have surprised me if uh Noriega got off on all of the charges that you know instead of being found guilty and then let him go just isn't we're an embarrassment you know truly truly and and i just think you know we have this kind of short term we are not interested in developing the region unless there's big business involved and wants to get involved down there we we tend to treat them as sort of like a backyard and you know i'm just just like Mexico right it's sort of it's our our little colony is that they do just if they provide the labor and the debiting of uh of Ford or uh uh the united fruit then that's fine yep but uh if they're actually trying to educate  well the Soviet Union uh now really called the Commonwealth of Independent States um is a mess um uh i think one of the biggest things we have to worry about is the uh control of nuclear arms especially Ukraine and Russia yeah i my main concern right now is first of all at this point with the current government and situation i don't see them as any threat to us at the moment however with the current state of the central government being as um tenuous as it is it wouldn't take much to uh cause a kind of fascist revival within uh Russia or any of the republics and then we do have a real clear foreign policy and a a problem and a threat because of the number of nuclear weapons that are there we seem to have lost the ability to control what's going on in the country right and any country which has as many nuclear weapons as they do is certainly is a threat but perhaps not at this second yeah you know i suppose you you say to yourself what will no rational uh person would would would launch uh nuclear weapons um but i guess that that's wouldn't necessarily hold uh for some radical government or temporary take over even well i work in international radio um and uh one of the groups that we're working with has been Radio Eurovan which is in Armenia and i you know in a sense you'd think being a you know an American or a westerner it would make sense that we there is no real great threat that these people aren't nuts but you listen to the what the Armenians have to say about their neighbors the Azerbaijanis and they launch in a second if they had an access to those weapons right there is a great deal of religious hatred in that part of the world and this is stuff that goes back to the days of Christ i mean yeah yeah this is not a two hundred year or or a fifty year uh problem this goes back centuries and the amount of hatred i mean there's accusations of using chemical weapons now both on both sides and yes yeah it into a republican strife amongst these various um former parts of the Soviet Union i think you could have a regional use of nuclear weapons but i don't think that they see us as a threat anymore right i guess i agree with that um um the other concern is as time goes on they could become an economic threat um but i think what will happen is they will go through an Asian right type of uh introduction into the business world where beginning there'll be cheap labor and uh you you know then we will have an i'd say thirty years if things stay the way things are now they could become another Korea or Malaysia or Thailand type of source for cheap labor where American products could be built and uh i think that's where they are headed right well i think that that there's a uh qualitative difference that uh Russia and and much of the Soviet Union still has a lot of natural resources that some of these other countries you mentioned just never had um-hum so that uh you know the commonwealth states could could easily you know leapfrog the uh the you know stepping stone path uh laid out by the by the Southeast Asian countries well they do have a huge oil reserve the problem is that they don't have the ability to exploit it at this point right they could become a major source for oil for us as well as timber and um other products agriculture could become very important for them using modern farming techniques in the Ukraine and i suspect they will form some sort of economic union when all is said and done i don't think i don't think yeah yeah yeah we're we're still going through a a uh you know a settling period you know they're not sure who they want their leaders to be they're not sure how they want the you know uh relationships between the states to to shape so i agree with you know they're they need another couple years to to let them uh settle down and uh start cooperating well i certainly hope that we will i i wish we would incorporate some sort of marshall plan over there because i think one of the problems that this country has in dealing with them is we aren't doing enough right now um-hum and the chances for things getting out of control and another fascist type of regime rising are quite good um anyone at this point who can give them food security and make them you know feel some pride again could become a major threat especially some of these republics which are striving to become independent from central Moscow and that kind of administration um and if we don't get our tushes in there and spend more effort and money and funds trying to get things back on the ground there i think we're in  so uh what uh kind of clothing do you have to wear for work well uh i bear a variety uh i'm a supervisor out at TI so i wear anything from uh jeans and uh a sport shirt to a you know dress slacks or dress shirt no coat and tie thanks goodness yeah i don't like those much myself how about you uh it's it's pretty casual uh i usually uh usually wear something like jeans sneakers uh kind of work you do um i do engineering uh using uh computer operated and grading machines oh yeah and some of it so some of i guess that would be pretty casual yeah some of it's uh i mean i don't have to see customers or anything yeah but some of it's a little bit dirty you know you got all this machinery and stuff so you don't really want to be wearing your best stuff for that well i was in the uh retail business for about fifteen years so i uh had my fill of coat and ties um yeah fifteen years yep were were you supervising then too i was uh store manager for Kinney shoes oh i guess you'd say uh supervisor um some anyway yeah not a topic you can get into very deep is it yeah so let's see where where did you you said you're in Houston yeah so you don't have to dress very warmly i suppose no we uh even this this year particular was real warm uh it didn't hardly get cold not to wear a coat almost really how how cold did it get uh i don't we didn't even have a freeze i don't believe got down about thirty uh below thirties is about the worst it did that i can remember not very often at that you say you have to wear a tie or no no i don't huh-uh ah that's good fortunately yeah guess that can be pretty hot too what'd you think about that thing out in LA which thing they've got more than one that verdict they came up with oh everybody's talking about that here really yeah i guess it's uh created quite a stir yep rioting and stuff yeah i hear there's some uh smaller amount going on in Atlanta too oh i hadn't uh hadn't been paying that close attention to the news i guess i ought to tune in tonight yeah and what do you think about it you think he was uh you think it was a good verdict or yeah they uh acquitted the cops that supposed that beat him up yeah certainly by looking at the video tape it didn't seem all that uh reasonable but yeah i think that's what surprised everybody was the fact they let them off after looking at the tape um course i guess there was a lot more uh to it yeah must've been i guess only saw you know a small part of the the story that is that what you're uh seeing on the TV now or i'm sorry is is that on the TV now why you mentioned it or oh yeah it's been on there i was listening to it on a talk show on the way home from work tonight yeah hum yep  well i haven't had an awful lot of uh incidents in regarding child care when my two year old was in New Orleans she got bit on the cheek and uh but uh that's about the the uh the extent of it but but but the when i really am uh am concerned about is that uh so many of these child care places are are coming under uh uh you know investigation for for uh you know child molestation uh-huh and i and i and i'm saying to myself well you know you you dump your your your little turnip off to uh you know this child care place and they don't pay very much and why why why would they be interested in your in your little turnip unless you know one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest you know uh-huh and uh that's a terrible kind of thing and i i don't think my children have ever been subject to that but my wife didn't work and so we didn't really didn't have that much exposure to it uh-huh well i am a working mother i have three children and my children since i um since they were very young i've had various various um different alternatives child care arrangements and like most working mothers i i'm really not defensive about it i personally feel um in our particular situation i'm a much better mother when i work out of the home and my kids i think are very very secure well raised children my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities hm so i i i uh you know it is a problem and but as you pointed out i think i think the real problem is the low pay child care facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford when our children were very young we had a pay a live in paid babysitter that was wonderful and then as they got older they went to uh i preferred to call them schools and they really were all day preschools and they were wonderful hm and i think they got exposed to a lot of neat things oh well that's interesting but we did we really truly did pay a fortune i mean we were paying at one point well about about close uh close to about five hundred dollars a week for two children oh my God well you must have a just one hero ace professional job to support something like that so well i'm a physician i'm a physician uh and as is my husband and i and i felt very uh very good about working i'm a pediatrician actually oh well yeah um-hum so uh but i think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children but and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for i think well not not all of us you know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for i'm an engineer and oh well i think it's real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in and we had a really wonderful arrangement um i'm with the university actually and they had a wonderful uh program that started at age three uh-huh and it was about a block away from the hospital where i work and so many times at lunchtime i would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing and they had wonderful they had things like gardens and lots of pets and just they had a four to one uh teacher student ratio so that that sort of and all most of the teachers had degrees um yeah five hundred dollars a week for two kids that's incredible yeah it was incredible actually but it was good i mean it was it was at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then in addition i paid a little bit extra oh oh but the kids were i mean they really had some great opportunities but that what you were alluding to earlier is you know women who work for minimal wage and well well yeah and and really have to feel they have to put their children sometimes they do put them in uh fairly low paying situations situations you know they could uh somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and you know and that's a good starting wage but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care uh-huh um-hum no even that that really i think i don't it's been awhile since i've looked at my youngest child is eight so it's been a little while since i've looked into actually day care centers but they are you know the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since and so i mean we used to pay pay fifty cents an hour to babysit but mine mine are twenty two twenty three and twenty seven so you know that i guess babysitters now are up at what five dollars an hour um-hum um-hum something like oh my well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children i mean it has been a real um there there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences and i think i think they have captured a certain market again but but then there are babysitting groups as a pediatrician one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections as you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around and um-hum oh yeah  okay well what's happening in New York well that's what we're doing too on our our current events and it's all over the oh what's happening in New York we're all reading about Los Angeles i think of course the TV and we're having a little bit of uh uh you know demonstrations here in Dallas but not anything like they're having in LA i should hope not really i i i was just reading this morning in the paper that it's also spreading to San Francisco as well oh is that right well it the rioting and all that kind of thing uh-huh and last night it was going into some of the nicer areas too you know uh rather than just staying in the in the uh in the sections that it started in hm but uh i get my current events um all three ways you know talking to people uh some TV although not much TV and uh reading the paper do you get and uh i'm big on the morning radio i guess i woken get woken up by the alarm and catch the day's news real quickly well that's something i used to do when i had a long drive to work or a or a maybe a thirty or forty minute drive to work i would turn the the news on and listen to that all the way uh-huh but i don't do that anymore it's just that i guess a habit i've gotten out out of and that's uh that's a real good way to get everything recapped you know i was just doing some thinking recently on we only hear we hear the news in a slanted fashion by how it's reported to us uh-huh i was looking at this morning's paper and you see uh you know the cover photo is a truck and and in the background everything's in flames um-hum and i think they kind of uh set you up in a way well i know they do i was uh i worked in public relations for um a a Safeway Stores which was a is a big grocery chain in used to be in this area it's not here any longer and it used to be in New York i don't know there yeah i've heard of it and uh i was their uh press person uh public relations person for about five years and handled all of the press and i would tell them one thing on the phone very carefully um-hum uh and they would report it not so carefully and in different context you had to be so careful uh whenever there was an interview on television uh they would tape a interview ask you lots of questions and then they would just take excerpts out that uh you know standing alone would didn't mean the same thing and so but we just really you really had a we had a tough time uh relating to what you actually what was actually going on as to what was being reported um i i think uh the news is starting to think of itself as theater well i think you're you may be right there too uh and i can see where did you happen to hear the uh interview of the uh juror no no no uh last night on TV she said that the public saw only a small portion of that tape now i you know on this Rodney King um-hum now i can't side with her you know because they they you know you can see see what was happening and that's totally wrong but you know we were shown just a portion of something we weren't shown a whole picture well well something i read in the paper was you know if you just hear the headlines you don't know that there were three other people in the car that was stopped who got out put their hands up and said okay we give up um-hum that's exactly right you know and they don't tell you that that makes you so angry to think that oh they beat on this poor man um-hum this one person but he he had a choice to you know this all could have been you know avoided if he had behaved himself i i i believe they overreacted horribly exactly right but you know if you think of the cop's point of view he has a wife and two kids and he wants to get home tonight and he doesn't know how crazy this guy is exactly and he's resisting so everybody's fighting for their life and you can see how this can get out of hand um-hum exactly but but like you said we were not shown that we were not uh unless we you know read in-depth you you get that you don't get that impression and so that makes everybody up in arms i've been very annoyed lately by the sensationalism that's going on i was uh visiting some friends over the Easter vacation in California in uh California near San Francisco and the big thing out there was they were finally after twenty five years going to execute someone um-hum uh whereas they've always had a death pentalty penalty they always put it off um-hum and she had the TV on and they go to say they go on to say well the cyanide came into the room and after about a minute his head slumped and they went into gross gross detail um-hum i mean why is this on TV is this news do we want to know it right it was disgusting and this whole thing with Willie Kennedy Smith you know did he rape this girl did he not why is that headline news um-hum well it wouldn't be if it was anyone else yeah but i mean i think the newspapers are irresponsible it wouldn't have been if it  i know uh product quality first of all i have had to return products uh generally those products that i bought mail order recently um-hum well i think that you know brand name products that we've become familiar with have in most cases you know gotten better i think that we have a problem in this country with consumer protection laws and the lack thereof yeah i agree with you yeah for for a lot of things there's some real junky mail order places out there um that we've ordered from in the past and ended up with not what we expected and having an absolute nightmare especially in dealing with a mail order in trying to return a product and get satisfaction i it it seems like every time i turn around i have to write one of my world famous complaint letters to try and resolve these situations with these kinds of mail order places yeah uh but you know generally speaking i think products in most cases have gotten better than they were in the in the past yeah yeah i agree with you there yeah um usually i think it's it's not even the manufacturer so much as it's where you yes well like like where with you buy your stuff i guess a lot of your stuff mail order but if you buy it like if you go to like a uh a retail place like i don't know uh uh uh Silo or one of these you know they're usually the ones that are giving you the you know they give you a hard time yeah oh yeah i'm not happy at all with Silo i we have every time you look around and there there's a price that's better somewhere else i there's a lot of rip-offs out there uh even in parts of the retail uh community as far as uh you know they there seems to be this real lack of ability in dealing well with customer service right with and product support for a lot of these products i remembered when i you know certain product names where you'd get the product and immediately there's a problem with it and it needs to be upgraded and suddenly it's your responsibility to pay all of this money to have it done when it was their fault to begin with right yeah yeah that that really irks me and i you know i'm not use to that and with technology you know i've had some answering machines here die very quickly yet other brand names you know Panasonic and that that little that i can drop on the floor and they still work yeah it you you really these days because we don't everything's been deregulated we don't seem to care as much about consumer protection if you aren't ultrawise uh in shopping and looking for products you're in real trouble uh yeah i agree with you i mean you have to have your consumer reports you got to have um you know David Horowitz and and all these things it's just to buy something i mean the the amount of money you have to spend on some of this high technology yeah today and then you have these brand names that attempt to mimic the the these brand names that we know right and then you're you're if you're not informed as a consumer you end up with absolute junk yeah it's it's true that's happened to me i'm i mean i've gone uh when when Walkman's first came out uh i i think i had i bought two when they first came out i just a radio one and then i had a radio and a cassette one and or just the cassette one um-hum and uh the one was Panasonic and the other one was like not even a brand name but those both lasted me for like three years and then i mean then within the past year and a half two years i've probably gone through about six of them yeah you know and and i really don't think i'm abusive or any i'm not you know well yeah they do they wear out i we've just had an RCA television that we bought two years ago go up and just decide i'm not working anymore and you know before you buy TV it's like ten fifteen years they're just uh-huh yeah yeah but now i mean two years we're having trouble excuse me yeah yeah i mean that's really um it's it's it's even with cars now too i mean it it in every area in every any kind of product oh yeah i mean we have a Buick uh eighty five Park Avenue that you know once you past the three year point everything just started falling apart yeah and and by the time we're done i mean we could've bought a whole new car for the amount of money yeah it's yeah it's true sad but it's yeah you know and uh how about these places where you go like out in Silo i think it's Silo no uh there is a store uh The Appliance Store i don't i don't think i think their local is just uh western Pennsylvania but uh whenever you go there they try to sell you the insurance you know oh yes you know where you want to extend your warranty of course i'm i know other places do this too you know oh yeah the the worst value is because if something goes wrong it's generally in the first thirty or sixty days that you own it right oh they do that on VCR and it's high pressure i mean it's like well you know you must be stupid if you're not going to buy this why right yeah yeah they really try to you know tack on another fifty sixty dollars we have  are you in the middle of anything uh no i'm not in the middle of anything i've just about the last thing i did about maybe oh close to a year ago now i guess i'd i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house so i guess that was yeah that was that was fairly large undertaking a a it's it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house the whole thing did the framing and all oh we did it all except for the sheetrocking that was the only thing we didn't you know putting the ceiling up and things like that we don't we we weren't sure how to do that huh maybe you and i should get together because when i had my last big project i had the contractor do the framing and i did all the sheetrocking and the interior work yeah that's the exact opposite we did all put the roof up and did all the roofing and the put all the interior walls up we just didn't do any of the Sheetrock wall work and that's it because you have you know get those joints to go together and and whatever you have to put in there to get the Sheetrock to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that i didn't we didn't know a thing about any of that and so yeah my wife wishes i hadn't done that it's it looked very hard to do so we figured well just i don't think we could do it and make it look professional so we left it left it to somebody who does it for a living but i think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy probably so and i'd we'd never done it so we just left it alone but that's i guess so i'm only twenty one so yeah i my my vast experience of of home home owner's knowledge is not very much so it's just what i have to do more or less around the house you know for my parents so did you you framed it in frame uh on on you framed in new square footage or was it stuff that was already uh enclosed brand new so you it was brand new we started with the the backyard and turned it into part of the house so it was and you knew how you knew how to do the framing um well my dad knew how to do most of it you know he uh-huh he had we'd gotten a couple of books and then he just started doing it i don't know he well he did all the flooring himself he put the whole the whole floor in and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there and then we were put us like a not not necessarily a garage but just like a off the side of that after we had the house part made we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less it's not you know it's not enclosed it's just somewhere to drive another car to to park and it's do do you build on slabs down there or did you build it up off the ground uh it's off the ground on the piers uh-huh it's on about uh twenty two inch piers something like that did you had those poured or you did them yourself so uh no those are those are we did those ourselves you just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete so yeah exactly so it's huh well the last thing i did completely myself was an outside deck which i was pretty proud of yeah those are those are we'd done i've done one i helped somebody do one of those before those are those are you know you can buy them in kits but we didn't do that way but it's yeah no i designed it from scratch and did a pretty did a pretty good job those are nice though they're pretty forgiving you know you can always tear stuff out and redo it it's a yeah yeah that is not near like building a house or anything but yeah those are nice especially when you get done you got something right you know i don't know i like them you just sit out on the on the deck and do whatever have a barbecue or yeah i've i built it two levels and with a big toy box and some benches and uh a backrest and all that stuff i'm yeah that sounds nice all done by yourself huh designed yeah we had a friend with a tractor who dug the pier holes so we could pour concrete and support it with a a nice firm four by four posts and uh yeah and then the rest of it i just did a a contractor friend helped me uh with some of the um foundation work but uh it's pretty so it was about four or five hundred square feet the same size as the addition that i just put on so yeah that's a pretty that's a good size deck yeah it's uh not that expensive i think it will cost me three dollars a square foot and uh you know it no less than that cost cost me about five hundred dollars six hundred dollars all together so yeah that's yeah that's right yeah that's good that's not bad at all you didn't have to yeah the the wood man it's it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is you know to get to get good lumber it costs i don't know about Dallas but around even in this little town it's it's not cheap at all i was surprised yeah i'd be surprised if it wasn't uh cheaper where you are well yeah it probably comes from where you are it's probably more there yeah that that it probably does i i don't not sure but most when i drive through that area that's all i see is yeah it's nothing but woods up here down here pressure treated pressure treated lumber yards yeah yeah well i don't i haven't i mean i haven't i used to live in Dallas in Arlington actually and but that was just when i was a kid so i don't really know what the cost of living is even like in Dallas anymore but uh-huh it's i don't know we're a college town so that doesn't help us out any because we we have gas is a dollar twelve dollar twelve a gallon so that's probably about what you're paying so right East Texas huh yeah my current project is a walkway which i'm building around the house and out to the backyard to um you know digging it out and laying sand and putting uh pavers on top of that so that's a a lot easier yeah you got something going all the time  uh with regard to uh to jury trials i you know i i really feel as though uh jury trials are are uh whatever system has been been used historically in particular jurisdiction you know is really the the only kinds of things that you can use because the the jurisprudence is you know based on on uh you know on accumulated body of law and if if you have a situation where you change that body of law then all of sudden they they start they could start going back and digging up all these cases that uh that would be handled differently were they judged by today's standards so i i really don't think it they they can really do much of anything to change it what do you think um i i don't think so possibly in the jury selection would be the only just for example what we're seeing in California i guess yeah it makes you wonder um had the jury been a different group of people what would've happened with that outcome um and and the problems that that has come that has come from this decision that that jury came to after all of us witnessed what we did with the video tape beating um just makes you wonder i guess whether or not they well won't well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that but then then you know the defense lawyer addressed each and every one of those blows apparently um-hum that's that and you know the other two guys sat in the car um-hum and they didn't get beat up no you know Rodney got beat up because he he you know he purposes you know he involved himself in some sub self-destructive behavior um-hum and uh um just like the burning and looting is self-destruct everybody says well this is the nineties and they're gonna rebuild and it'll be even better uh-huh oh yes hey what do you think you know some some black guy with capital is gonna come in and invest in that area uh that's right with everybody with that mindset they they're they're gonna that whole area is gonna be turned into residential ghetto you know and and you might even be able to to use it for for a bombing test site you know they're only gonna suffer yeah they're only gonna suffer they they've defeated themselves with with their looting and violence um i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or uh don't live there or whatever we all saw the same thing on the on the tape and um well everybody's everybody's saying this is gonna be a new era we're gonna reexamine this thing hey the bunch the average person is gonna take a look at that and say suspicions confirmed they're a bunch of animals you know how can you really deal with an environment where you're gonna lose everything forty deaths i mean there are forty people that are dead as a result of that i know that's really ridiculous and i'm just trying to determine you know how you address and how you weigh you know Rodney getting getting the the hell beat out of him against you know forty deaths against forty other people being yeah and there's no other i i'm not sure exactly sure uh what the circumstances surrounding the deaths and i'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths and and pursued it you know because i'm interested in the circumstances surrounding this thing those deaths um-hum is it a looter that got shot by a store owner or just a bystander an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what um i you know no tears yeah and and so i but i i suspect a number of them you know you you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot you know in in the street it uh or or beaten and and my reaction is i would've run over fifty people before rather than stop and uh and there there would've been just uh nothing but carnage after after if i'd been at the wheel no one would've stopped me right that's that's exactly how i feel too i wouldn't have uh they wouldn't have stopped my car for any anything had i seen them coming but i was just wondering since you were you're in you're back east um and a little closer to the the bigger cities probably than we are in Idaho here right i'm inside the beltway oh you know how capital gang they always say well inside the beltway they think thus and so and i say well wait a minute i'm inside the beltway and i don't think like that um-hum oh in what uh section of the government do you work i'm a government employee i'm with the FBI oh oh that's interesting yes and and so um uh and and the reason i'm doing this whole thing is because you know Rick who is another government employee wanted a speech segments of my speech that uh were done a year ago and he wanted another collection a year later uh-huh oh and so this is my seventh call a year ago i did eleven calls oh i see and so that's that's why uh uh that's that's why i'm religiously getting on the phone because i have a unique you know i have a unique situation here in that if i don't participate um-hum  do you happen to have a system for budgeting your money um just sweared i heard that beep but usually you can hear the tape or you can hear it starting um oh i've never go ahead uh no no i am a very organized person that believes i ought to have all those things and we don't uh-huh so you it's not just you you have a family yes i'm married i have two kids um young four and a half and three and as far as sitting down and putting a formal budget paper and pen you know and following it no we don't do that um i have a very good idea of what our expenses are and how much we can afford to spend and can't spend and you know so it it's not like we just totally don't have a clue as to what's going on but i wish we were a little more organized a little more you know when i think about it there are certain parameters we work about faithful to a budget but we don't have a budget where it says its so much for this and so much for that but we do put a certain amount in checking account each month which we should pay for the mortgage and the electric bill and all that right and i know there's a certain number i put on my grocery and pocket money and sometimes i have a little left over and i kind of put it away but the next week i pull it out and add it to that number right and i know that i don't go above that and i know that when we empty out the mortgage and the electric bill money and all that that you know you got to stop spending but you know i i don't know if i can say i guess with the grocery and pocket money i do have a particular number but that's right that's right you know you never know if if you own a home you never know if something's going to break and you're gonna need more that's right well it's very difficult my husband is in is self-employed he's in uh financial planning and and so all of his income is commissions it's very hard to sit down and budget because you don't know what he's going to make uh you know we kind of think you know he usually brings home at least this much and i can base you know base it from there right but there's months that he brings home uh you know three times that much and there's some months he doesn't bring home anything it just depends on where the commissions fall and so you kind of have to you know i have in in my mind i know the basics i know what we've got to meet each month you know and and my salary helps towards that because mine's set you know but um i think that we could probably save a little better or afford to do more things for fun that we'd like to do if i did follow a you know pencil and paper budget but do you folks get to save well differently i mean do i have a savings account sitting in the bank no but uh we do have you know universal life insurance on him we have um a 401K a CODA plan preretirement plan on me through my work uh so there are things that we have money invested in you know i have a profit sharing and pension uh savings more toward retirement now savings sitting at the bank that hey let's plan a vacation no when we decide we wanna do something like that we start saving for that and when we get it we go right you know cause i i'm finding more and more that people don't have so many dollars left after they spend on what they have to spend i i think it's the rare person who says well i'm just putting money away for my kids and and every week puts in fifty dollars or something i don't i think people aren't having much left at all nowadays right i think it's more and more difficult i do have savings accounts for my kids at work and um and i use that for their uh life insurance investments uh but i also pull from that and from mine if we need the money you know if you need it for something or like you said the something comes up on the house and you've got to have it well you go deplete those funds and use it you know right that come from somewhere yeah i work part time i'm a substitute art teacher oh so you know we try to live on my husband's salary and when i want something frivolous that he probably wouldn't agree to i just you know spend my own money or chip it in when you know something big comes up that's true now we have an interesting arrangement my husband loves golf and i'm glad he has i mean it's his release it's his time each week where he's not dad and he's not husband and he's not employee and he you know what i'm saying it's just a release i thought you said when he's not dead not dad well jeez and no dad dad not dead i'll have to work on that uh and and i'm glad he has that i'm glad he enjoys it but i used to resent it because i felt like all of our spare money went to his golf i don't particularly have anything i like to do from week to week or day to day or or anything like that and that's fine um and so what i started doing and he's never said you know if i wanted something i'd look in the checkbook because i'm to practical and say nah i'd better not spend the money uh-huh well he's never held me back you know he's always said if you want something go get it but i didn't feel comfortable so now when he goes and golfs i take you know if he takes out ten bucks or fifteen bucks or twenty bucks i take the same amount and i stick it in a savings account that i have at the credit union at work oh and i save for something i want because  experience with um uh dealings in government are that i'm one of these three million dish owners in this country and we've been fighting since about nineteen eighty six to try and get some legislation enacted against some of these cable companies and how they've been stumping on their competition and what little there is and it's a very pro consumer type of legislation but we're constantly running into trouble trying to get it passed because we're up against huge pack money donations from the cable TV industry uh-huh in this country and i've come to learn that a lot of these politicians unless you can mobilize enough consumers or voters to make a stink about an issue if there's a big pack check involved they'll take the check every single time uh i guess it's not totally not understandable you know i'm i'm sure that if you're looking at whether or not you're going to get elected and have enough money to run that they've got to uh got to take that into consideration oh sure but i think it goes i you know a little of it obviously is they're getting themselves prepared for when they're out of office when they become consultants or high-powered lobbyists themselves and uh i i think that although some of the people that we have in elected office are upstanding honest people i think that as they're in the system from longer and longer they get corrupted by it basically by losing touch with the people that they're supposed to be serving and i think they forget who it is they're supposed to be representing it's uh well it it's it's such a complicated thing let me just relate to you uh an experience that i had with politics at a lower level uh and i think what it boils down to is that if you can't find compromise you're not going to be successful um-hum um in eighty six i was president of of an association called DPMA Data Processing Management Association um-hum uh which was actually at the time we were the third largest chapter in the world we had five hundred plus members and it was just i mean an absolute uh unforseen unforseen unforeseen thing that a woman should become president in this good ole boy city okay don't misunderstand me now but it it all came down to the fact that you had to be able to deal i mean we had uh our board our officers and our board board of directors of about twenty people now this is a good size group of people to manage and to come to one voice on on certain things you understand and in my year we did perfectly fine and the the gentlemen that came behind me was a uh wonderful intelligent smooth really good looking successful young black man but he had his own agenda and wouldn't compromise with people he thought that because he was president he could drive through whatever he chose um-hum and it was a terrible a terrible situation i mean the whole thing almost fell apart and i think what you have to do i mean you i think it's important to have an agenda but you also have to be able to to compromise on it because if the majority are against you and you lose more than two or three times you know you lose it it been a terrible situation for you and your reputation sure and i think what happens is in order to get anything passed in the big political system in Washington you have to you know compromise with other people and vote for something you don't really believe in but so that they will vote for something that you're asking for yeah that's that kind of um you know i in a in it's gotten very pervasive when it comes to expectations on the part of members of each of the party that you try not to cross party lines on certain votes especially these days and the problem comes about when you have somebody who wants to vote for something the other party advocates strongly and and they really want to vote for it yeah well in some cases they do they vote their conscience and then of course you know they may be punished for not doing the appropriate thing that that came down with the cable issue yeah uh-huh because we had a Republican Senator uh John Danforth who is strongly in support of it but then you had the White House strongly against it because it would reregulate to an extent yes it would and they just wouldn't hear of it at all so we had trouble but he stood his ground and carried with him a lot of influence you know people underneath him who are Republicans but at the same point it causes a lot of strife and then people dig their heels in and and you know there's probably about ten percent or maybe less than that five percent of the people who can vote their own conscience and still be successful but all the rest fall by the wayside um-hum yeah you have to be a real old timer and powerful to be able to do that especially when it's committee assignment handout time and right right i am things like that  opinion on whether we need to change to the metric system is that i don't think that i have an opinion one way or the other i kind of feel that there are more important issues to be dealt with than worrying about the metric system and i think the reason it failed last time is that most people really just didn't see any real benefit in changing so i guess if we were to go about making the change you would have to really demonstrate to people that there is some legitimate reason to make the change that would directly benefit them otherwise we're never going to really see any change yeah well i oh i'll say this first i'm certainly for conversion to the metric system unfortunately i'm not sure how well grounded my uh feelings for that are maybe it's um-hum just because it's a highly regular system and you don't have to worry about whether something is five thousand two hundred and eighty units or or yeah i'm just going to walk over here and stop my cats from doing what they're doing um and the metric system is you know hum you it has so many different prefixes like autometer and femtometer and stuff like that you don't need them just use the you know the meter the kilometer you know whatever it's i don't know that that's i think that's its primary uh yeah primary uh use is that and of course in scientific uses uh things like the like a mile uh or i'm not sure a pound uh have have some use whenever you try to uh combine them into formula then you have to uh have conversion constants and things like that so most most of the formulas although they are are some that uh don't obey this rule most scientific formulas can be adapted with the metric system because of the way things are interrelated that you'll need those extra conversion constants yeah like a cubic let's see what is it a cubic centimeter of water is also a gram of water at standard temperature and pressure um-hum well whenever the Canadians changed we're since we're very close to the Canadian border here we kind of observed things when they made their change and they were able to convert a little more readily although most people up there still would talk in terms of fahrenheit instead of Celsius um-hum uh even though they try to get you to use the Celsius system it it went a little easier because Canada is so influenced by Britain right and a lot of the products and services that they were either dealing with or receiving on their end were really equipped for the metric system and uh it was a easier change and they saw some direct benefit because they didn't have to pour the extra income in to making special products just for the older system right but um you know in in this country you have really stubborn people yeah that's true who i don't think are going to especially you know they may do it in the more in the big city centers or in certain round uh manufacturing industries but the average person in Raleigh Missouri i don't think is going to what was this celsius stuff you know i don't well it it happens first well it i guess it happens first in either of the two places i guess either in the school or just products hum uh one thing about uh a lot of US products i'm just looking at something here shaving cream that is not in this case uh list both what they are in the English or British Imperial System whatever it's called units uh and the metric system units so this just says seven ounces um-hum uh i i think i've heard that in Canada what they did was primarily they didn't change the size the sizes that various products came in they just changed the way they were annotated yeah so something before was you know was and see you have things in odd measurements that's even true like for film and like you know sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter film um-hum those odd things come about i'm not sure exactly what they are because it's like a half inch or whatever they just you know they say okay millimeter this is a European thing too so uh we'll just used to keep using the standard size but we'll just call it something else so you have odd things like sixteen millimeter and thirty five millimeter where originated in the metric system it'll probably be something regular but i guess that's that's not too yeah not too important but i think uh at least in northern or northeastern schools uh they people are relatively uh well inducted into the metric system anyone who takes you know chemistry physics anything like that in school i think in most cases it's done in in metric system it was for me yeah i i learned metrics you know in high school and and before that so i'm familiar with the system i'm still using inches and pounds and the like i the only thing we as Americans have become accustomed to as far as the metric system is now we buy two liter bottles of Coke you know yeah when you tell somebody liters bottles of Coke yeah that's true that is and oddity i mean it sounds you know a gallon sounds like that's too much but two liters and and you know doesn't sound as bad as three quarts or
