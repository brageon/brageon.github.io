okay hi hi um yeah i'd like to talk about how you dress for work and and um what do you normally what type of outfit do you normally have to wear well i work in uh corporate control so we have to dress kind of nice so i usually wear skirts and sweaters in the winter time slacks i guess  and in the summer just dresses  um-hum we can't even well we're not even really supposed to wear jeans very often  so it really doesn't vary that much from season to season since the office is kind of you know always the same temperature and is right right is there is there um any is there a like a code of dress where you work do they ask so not formally right but it's kind of understood that we're supposed to dress a little bit nice a lot of times we have to go over to uh like Jerry Junkins' office and Bill Ellsworth's office to deliver stuff right and we prepare a lot of foils for Marvin and Bill so  we have to dress a little bit nice we're not right right and does it does it change i guess um you can can you judge like depending on what you think you'll be doing that day yes now you know if if everybody like in August when everybody's on vacation or something we can dress a little more casual or right ice storms of course you know we all came in in our tennis shoes but i guess that would have to do with the weather but um yes yeah yeah well it it that's right and it unless it's an extremely you know an unusual day yeah and it was usually uh also uh where i was it was um in in engineering and and it was it was a casual office there was no formal dress code but um-hum um uh usually engineers are expected to to dress you know little more professionally it just in case things would come up during the day sometimes unexpected meetings or a client would come in and wanna see you yeah um-hum right uh other times it could be very casual if you knew you would be at a desk all day and nobody would see you  um yeah or um-hum what area do you work in uh well i was i was in a uh private consulting firm so um and uh and uh anyway um right now i'm i'm not i'm not there but but anyway um okay um and season really same season to season um uh it changes with the weather you know uh wear light clothing i guess if it's hot out but um it with the yeah but then usually in the summer it's cold in the offices because the air conditioner's doing its job so well that's
 that's true and and i think also that um the women actually have uh uh you have a little bit more variety maybe maybe lighter cotton clothing in the summer and woolens in the winter whereas the oh yeah the men often have to wear shirt and tie no matter right right right what time of what time of the year that's right it uh-huh just suits and there's not a whole lot of fabric variance there and they can't have a rayon suit  so that's that's true so um do they were were there um are you allowed to um be casual like if it was summer were were you allowed to wear sandals and those that  not really not really i think i mean it's kind of unwritten but i think we're supposed to wear hose and and shoes you know most of the people do anyway right uh most of the women wear uh most actually most of the women wear suits more than anything else oh i see uh-huh but i'm not in that professional of a position  so i don't i'm not expected to do that okay and and and also like the um also the the all the supporting kind of stuff secretaries and clerks and things are they also they have same similar similar yeah um-hum yes pretty much i'm a secretary yeah yeah ours were ours were different i guess it seemed like they they were much there was much more casual dress although i don't think everybody looked at that you know as a good thing yeah yeah but there's really no written rule i guess they couldn't write that down that might be discrimination or something i don't know i mean i've never been told what to wear or what not to wear right that's that's right it's just you know judging from what everyone else wears is how i determine yeah yeah and you know what i feel a comfortable in you don't wanna stand out too much that's right yeah that's true and um hm well that's it well that pretty much covers the subject well thanks for calling me yeah i don't know what else what more we can say about that that's oh it's been nice talking to you and i guess we just hang up huh okay all right nice talking to you bye-bye yep that's all good-bye okay bye. // okay uh first um i need to know uh how how do you feel about uh about sending um an elderly uh family member to a nursing home well of course it's you know it's it one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do you know unless it's just you know really you know for and for their uh you know for their own good yes yeah i'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out uh our had to place my mother in a nursing home she had a rather massive stroke about uh um-hum uh six eight months ago i guess and uh we were i was fortunate in that i was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in our little hometown yes so i was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it but there's well i had an occasion for my uh mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really not a very good experience uh it had to be done in a hurry i mean we didn't have you know like six months to check all of these places out and it was really not not very good uh deal we were not really happy with the yeah nursing home that we finally had fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks and she was able to to return to her apartment again but it's really a big uh big decision as to you know when to do it yeah you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available course there's you know there's not one on every corner especially in you know smaller areas smaller towns um-hum yeah probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in nursing home and um she had used a walker for for quite sometime probably about six to nine months and um um-hum she had a fall and uh finally uh she had uh Parkinson's Disease and it got so much that she could not take care of her house she then she lived in an apartment and um hm right that was even harder actually because it was you know it was just a change of um-hum um-hum change of location and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling i mean she traveled she had she had children all across the United States and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children yes um-hum right uh-huh and um that was pretty heartrending for her i think when she finally came to the realization that you know no i cannot i cannot take care of myself oh i can imagine um-hum that's tough that's really tough yeah i mean for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has uh not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines and you know facing that situation it it's quite a dilemma i think um-hum um-hum yes my mother excuse me go ahead yeah well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthened for our family was rather than have one child make that decision um-hum than just delegate it i think that they they had a great deal of um all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference and i mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family that's great getting down together and doing that and and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them and you know making that decision and then
that's right it um-hum right yeah finding a place and everybody had duties to perform you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a a proper nursing home um-hum um-hum yep you were very fortunate and they i know they and well they had well they had they had seen it coming so so i mean it i mean i i i i hardly i i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me um-hum um-hum absolutely unfortunately unfortunately at a lot of times it responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know maybe one child in the whole family you know yeah yeah well we we yeah and uh it's usually not a very smooth smooth thing we were uh lucky  i was lucky too that i only have my one brother um-hum and uh fortunately we agreed you know on exactly you know what we thought should be done my mother also was very very independent she had her own still had her own little house and still driving her own car at age eighty three yeah we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really you know really much aware of what was going on um-hum that nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing of course she would she would not have been happy there at all but uh as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us yeah yeah well with my with my grandmother i think it was it was such that uh that she did not have the problem with she was very well aware and her daughter came and visited her at least her daughter came and visited her and also her uh several grandchildren came and visited her everyday um-hum um-hum um-hum that's great and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest um i i i think it would be it was more of a relief for her um-hum sure and um i mean but she was truly she was truly aware i mean i i didn't i don't know how i would how i would deal if if one of my parents came with with Alzheimer's or something like that which is which is far more devastating um-hum um-hum that'd be tough yes absolutely and umi i think i think that what one thing that was that they were really concerned with probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care that the people that work there were very um-hum yes right um-hum were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible i i think i think i think you know for myself i i see that as probably the the um-hum yes yeah we were fortunately what everything would hinge upon is it how close is it to a home environment that's the that's probably the major question oh yes that's right um-hum yeah i think a great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the elderly you know in several in a whole lot of areas because people are of course population is getting older you know yeah yeah yeah you know it's it's interesting that that a lot of the population in the United States is changing because you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time um-hum um in matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families it wasn't but i guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation um-hum that's right yes we we don't we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier um-hum um-hum that's right sure absolutely and people are families are scattered so much nowadays uh yeah yeah i i i think that perhaps perhaps the extended family you know that that it may be one of the solutions to a lot of thi ngs even even even child care you know i mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not yes any of the grandparents would we feel they're gonna be a good  they're gonna be a good caretaker for our children but i mean they raised us after all yeah yeah just because they're grandparents just yeah just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them a good child carer yeah but uh i'm i i think that you know i mean we always uh i mean i've i've had a a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people especially where they've had uh extended family and i and and i i kind of see that that you know perhaps you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know i mean uh it's um-hum money seems to be too big of an issue with with with with with with what's going on today and i i think i think that we may not you know that may be oh yeah sure realistically it is yes you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problems i mean  i mean we may not we may not have as  high a standard of living but um-hum that would certainly help yeah um-hum the quality but actually have a truer standard of living right that's just a matter of defining priorities i guess or some priorities anyway yeah yeah yeah i think your right okay well i guess that was it okay was good talking to you yeah take care bye-bye okay all right hey bye-bye alrighty uh i guess our topic today is air pollution and we are to just discuss what substances do you think contribute most to air pollution as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us right um does your work entitle uh anything in environmental along these lines me i'm in the legal department and um we do have uh a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues um-hum and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for other types of uh pollution like the toxic waste and such that TI has to dispose of the we normally put in the ground you know we're coming up with a a new solution we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and we just transport to these places but after while it always seems that the um oh the site starts to leak and then you have to clean it up and such but the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman and we're gonna have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants very from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up and that we won't be polluting the air i'm sure we have to have uh permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to what we can uh let you know go into the air yeah it's uh having uh uh well well i work in too i work in environmentals uh projects right now and so the Sherman deal is uh uh uh oh okay lost a lot of hair over that project uh what we run into um is we have the Texas Air Control Board TACB that send out uh jurisdictions under which we have to uh uh reply to oh uh-huh and a lot of their rules and regulations aren't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the TACB which is located in Austin in writing and hey look what we've done here at TI um-hum and uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to um uh this is air side allow allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage it's in in in tons per year um uh-huh okay and so what what you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in uh high-tech scrubber systems uh that uh scrub out the NOX and uh VOCs and and the ammonia compounds uh like all the acids uh to a certain level we are very um uh aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions so if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or there abouts um-hum and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there's a problem and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely uh it becomes a real issue especially when it's smoking and you have to get it fixed el pronto hm as you know the they're allowed to come on site the federaldes anytime they want drive through and see and inspect so it's a full time uh everybody has your home phone number type of job uh hm now is that place built or you're still in the makings of it the Sherman facility we are still in the closer to but still have a little bit of um finalization to do right it's been pitched to the Sherman uh City Council with uh open arms as well as the public we had open forum and and uh hm uh Tom Jones our environmental corporate environmental guy's handling the project um-hum and uh it's real uh going real well i think it's matter just a matter of fund the funds right now as i understand it um-hum uh but it's uh it's something else yeah that they're in the same issue we were uh hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there uh because the the system is setup where it won't have any emissions uh you're correct it will have something coming out of the stack obviously just because human nature but it won't have uh any uh right any bad stuff so uh i think TI we spend of of of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost uh uh first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the systems than any other firm i know of we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here and uh it's an interesting job but um well i know from some of the sites that we've had done quite a list of sites that have gone bad and you have to clean up and you know the law now is a super fund and anybody who's contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know uh damaged the ground or not uh everybody has to contribute and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've uh gotten pulled into these uh super fund deals to clean it up that's you know mega bucks to uh you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area and um certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the Sherman facility than um just letting it go in the ground because eventually you know it it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area it still only in time starts to leak out possibly yeah there there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place leaked again hm jeez uh i'm familiar with that one we uh we have stuff that's very interesting yeah we have hoods we have ductwork and all those type of uh interesting pieces of equipment where they have uh that we sample and it may have uh over uh a certain emission levels this is on the solid side and so we take it um-hum and uh we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid and we mix it with concrete and actually um potash per se and and concrete and then actually put it in the ground um-hum but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab hm which is totally legal but the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually shave up ductwork and things and so we're uh very very uh cognizitive and aware of all these type of uh um-hum expenditures because it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the the the world a better place to live and i think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that i really would um i've enjoyed speaking with you yeah this has been an interesting topic uh i was one of the i was responsible for all the planning and engineering of the corporate area in the north building yeah oh you were oh okay so uh i hope you like your office yes yes it's a heck of a lot different i mean we we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk we were about the only place in you know TI that had the gray metal desk people used to come and laugh and go gee i hadn't seen one of those in ten fifteen years yeah yeah glad to see y'all taken care of well the i think what changed everything and uh is uh y'all were y'all the only ones that make any money for TI here in the last two years we finally got a little respect nobody thought of us as a profit center before so exactly and that's um when you start making when you start paying your wages you know Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys right right not just overhead i've enjoyed exactly i've enjoyed speaking with you see you later bye-bye you too bye hi Cynthia what did you wear to work today um let's see what did i wear to work today um actually i wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse um and flat shoes so can you dress pretty casually um on occasion on occasion um i do vary um you know i wear suits i wear skirts and sweaters on occasion i can wear jeans um how about you yeah well i um run a business out of my home um-hum so i tend to get up in the morning put on sweats um do whatever i wanna do with the kids then whenever i have a meeting with a client i'll put a suit on and then and uh-huh uh-huh come home and get back into regular clothes again uh-huh um you know there's real no no no real dress code where i work um you see people wearing you know all different attire i um don't like to wear heels that really tires me out i work in a big building yeah so i i predominantly wear flat shoes um you know in the winter i wear sweaters in the summer i you know i like one piece dresses short sleeves things like that i've recently um tried tried to update my wardrobe trying to put suits together that i can interchange the jackets and the blouses and all that a lot right right that's helped me a lot with having i can only have a a limited wardrobe since i'm only working part-time right now um but still it gives it some variety add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that uh-huh um-hum um-hum right right accessories uh-huh what about your casual wear do you like to wear jeans most of the time um yeah mostly i mean at home i predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that also yeah it's nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when it's so hot yeah well they're um you know they're like Bermuda yeah they're like black corduroy Bermuda Bermuda shorts and sometimes i wear a blazer with them and i get really a lot of compliments on them um where i work is predominantly male so you know dress shorts yeah yeah they their attire is always the same you know suits or slacks you know jeans whatever and um but i'm really the only woman i guess at work that does that but seems to work for me in fact i just bought or i just got a new outfit as a gift that um not much yep it's one of those skorts you know the the it's shorts but it looks like a skirt so i think that'll be good for work too um-hum oh yeah it'll be comfortable yeah yeah so i guess down here uh we just recently moved to Texas so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit um we moved from Colorado where and i have a closet full of sweaters that uh-huh uh-hum uh-huh well see i live in Virginia you live in Virginia now oh that's interesting uh-huh yeah yeah so i'm you know like right now today was in about you know the fifties but um you know i i do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses uh-huh yeah i'd like to be able to wear those here today it's eighty eight degrees so needless to say my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now oh my uh-huh uh-huh today was uh definitely a shorts day around here um-hum yeah we're still pretty much you know in winter as far as that goes here this is pretty unseasonal unseasonal but um at least we you know it it it feels good it gets uh everybody doesn't have cabin fever today it's nice to get out and about um-hum uh-huh i guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing okay okay it was nice talking to you also bye-bye okay sounds good was nice talking to you bye-bye have you done a lot of camping recently no i haven't been camping since i was about sixteen oh okay but uh my family used to have a pop-up trailer and we'd go camping to a lot of different places we spent two weeks in Bastrop Texas once oh yeah uh where's that it's near Austin oh okay i'm not that much familiar with Texas we've been my family has been everywhere but mostly in Texas on the way to someplace else we've had oh gosh we've um-hum i've camped in a in a in a back of a van van then we got then we got a pop-up camper and then we got a trailer now they've got now they've got a big motor home so they they still do a whole lot of camping have you ever been camping in any of the big national parks oh gosh yes uh oh Yellowstone about four years ago four or five years ago and um oh we did my family when i was younger we went that was just you know what we did in the summers was go to the from you know national park to national park we had a lot of fun when i go camping i don't i don't like to rough it i like to have some a little bit of electricity electricity and a little bit of running water yes me too i'm not really into this going and sitting in a tent for a few days with nothing oh no no i've done it but it's not fun you don't want to do it for like three weeks at a time that's for sure God i have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer they're both geologists and they load up their truck with their tent and they go to New Mexico and they just find places to camp and go looking for rocks and ooh no no doesn't sound like a lot of fun to me uh my friend said that the last time they went uh she just got tired of the tent and it was cold at night and she got tired of eating out of cans and so they stayed in a hotel one night oh yeah just for fun shaking the scorpions out of their shoes no kidding no kidding gosh that's what the the the bugs i don't like the bugs oh me neither me neither the the mosquitoes just keep you up all night yeah the one good nice thing i remember about camping with my parents is they had a big hammock and they would always find a couple of a campsite with a couple of good trees to hang it in between and i could just lay in that hammock for hours yeah yeah that that's nice yeah when my family when my family camps we're the the only time you're at the camper is when you want to sleep otherwise you're just going constantly you know in all the in all the National Parks and stuff oh hum we camped at the let's see we camped down at at Galveston two or three years ago and that that was that was fun except that they uh were having a lot of problems with dead fish on the shore and they were and the and the smell of that was kind of gross but we stayed in Galveston Island State Park once but if a storm blew in and it was just horrible and the sand was blowing up our camp the little camping area was pretty near the shore oh how awful um-hum oh yeah and there were some pretty big dunes before the the camping area and the sand was all blowing up and couldn't even go out of the camper the wind was blowing so hard because you'd get sand in your eyes oh that's miserable yeah it was pretty bad yeah i had yeah pretty bad but we had a good time in our camper we usually we usually took box games and things to do in case it rained and they my parents always let us take a couple of friends so we always had a good time yeah yeah it's it's you it's you you always when you when there's kids you've always got to have other stuff to do because it's always gonna rain sometime and then your parents parents they drive the parents nuts yeah yeah and yeah well children aren't easily entertained by just enjoying the nature oh i know i wish i'd appreciated i wish i'd appreciated it more you uh when i was when we were camping so extensively you when we when we were younger yeah now i wish i could go back to those places yeah the time and i've got got a child and another one on the way so i wish i had time my my our pop-up camper just sits in the garage and collects dust unfortunately oh gosh it makes it a little my fiance and i one day would like to own a big motor home mainly because he's a football he's a college football coach and we're gonna have to travel a lot uh-huh yeah and it'd be nice if we had a big ole motor home and that way i could load up the rest of the wives and go to wherever the football game is and have someplace to sleep without spending big money for a hotel and and park it outside of the stadium and have a good ole time yeah that's true plus it's nice to have your own stuff there yeah plus you get eating out is expensive is so expensive and um-hum that is nice no kidding it really is so it it it it's a it can be really handy to have a camper just um because my our family lives in Missouri and uh when we take trips home we take our pop-up with us in good weather and stay overnight at a state park or something so we don't have to rent a hotel room and that's oh yeah that's nice you know paying five or six dollars instead of forty yeah no kidding yeah well what else well i think that's just pretty much it we've been on here awhile okay well it's been nice talking to you nice talking to you too bye bye-bye this is Archie hi Archie i'm Sharon have you seen Dancing with Wolf yeah i've seen that that's uh that was a really good movie probably one of the best things about it was the scenery and uh i thought the story was pretty good too i think i think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it have you ever lived in that part of the country no i haven't have you ever visited it um i've visited the Wyoming area i'm not sure exactly where Dances with Wolves was filmed i think it was the Black Hills of South Dakota could be i i haven't been to South Dakota have have you been up to that well i lived in Omaha for five winters and that rolling kind of uh oh okay terrain yeah is is fairly familiar the thing that i thought was interesting was that the critics apparently it's gonna win everything really uh and i had been told you know you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of that's true i agree with that um i i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that it i think it's been nominated for twelve awards and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldn't go anywhere that it was just gonna be a dud so it it has surprised everybody well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i i i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great and and it was the thing is it was a it was a good story uh-huh right and and and i guess that's what i really like although i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour yeah did you have you seen Sleeping with the Enemy no i've heard i've heard that's really great though you you have to go see that one and how about Silence of the Lambs go no you must really keep up i do i go every weekend i i uh those are two definite must see movies i think well isn't isn't Sleeping with the Enemy isn't that a is is it is it a terror movie or is it just suspenseful it's suspenseful i don't think it's very terror i mean there's not really any uh blood and guts in it or anything like that it's it's more suspense um the other one Silence of the Lambs is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody's not into that kind of stuff it's it's pretty graphic at points but uh i think they're both excellent movies do you do you listen to Gary Cohill Cohill is uh you know who he is no huh-uh yeah somebody in South Carolina told me about him he's a the movie critic um oh you've oh okay he's a movie critic on channel eight in Dallas yeah and he does uh he has a talk show on the KLIF anyway it's on from seven to nine or something and and and people call in and it's if you keep up with movies it's kind of interesting there's a certain amount of drivel that they do they've got uh they've got a couple of kids ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies but it's uh oh he anyway he it's interesting you listen to him and then you you go watch the movie fact they had people had just seen i was listening Sunday night a little bit when i was going to uh-huh pick up my daughter but anyway it was uh it the it it's interesting though the the the difficulty with with Dancing with Wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it and then you star in it uh the question is did he did he really know it was gonna be good or did he just do it i think that i think he really his heart was in it but i don't i don't think he really knew it was gonna be as big as it was i think it was something that he really wanted to do he wanted to direct it he wanted to act to star in it you know he he enjoyed the story line and i think he just really wanted he really wanted it whether it whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy because i think that i think he did a good job and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver um a little piece of trivia you know the guy when he first headed out from the army post yeah who no i don't know who that guy is he he plays on Murphy Brown oh he does yes he's as a recurring character every week he's Eldon her housepainter oh no now see i'd a i'd a never put those two together do you believe that that's that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that i thought no it's really funny but i thought it it turns you think back and yeah it was him but with a huh-uh yeah you know with the beard and all that stuff i mean it's uh yeah real scruffy looking yeah real scruffy looking and it was it was really funny it's uh that that he winds up playing in the movie but i thought it's good that you know it was a lot of fun yeah i don't know how long this conversation is supposed to go but we're at about five minutes i should think we've done enough you think so i mean i haven't been watching my watch um well i don't know what how do we end this thing i think it just says hang up why don't we do that good-bye Sharon well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state that's one thing and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that's another and the first kind of invasion of the first type of privacy seems invaded to me in very much everyday in this country but in the second type at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh um obviously everyday i i think i agree with that i think in a good example on the typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang and it's TI calling my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message and then i realize oh no this is something i solicited that's right so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that i realized no i i really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was almost an example of a situation an invasion that turns out to be not invasive uh-huh right it turned out to be uh uh an invitation exactly uh and at the same time i think that i receive on on the order of uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it from from personal parties or from these uh phone answering phone uh commercial things commercial solicitations solicitations primarily oh that that's a remarkable number i get them rarely and i'm still astounded that that uh one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effectiveness whatsoever um because i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what they are yeah i think they prey on people's um inherent politeness on the phone even with a machine i find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and you one's feeling obligated because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out um-hum um-hum um-hum and and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for me um-hum um-hum um i guess i'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second yeah this one that you raised and i don't think i would have thought about that i think that's a good idea on your part i don't typically feel intruded on on the things oh in the sense of finding out information well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer to not to be known and i mean you know the classic oh i don't know CIA conspiracy theories or whatever would have uh such parties trying to do it without your knowledge so there's things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it and i can't talk about the second one other than to to to generate paranoia yeah to surmise and i'd like to think that's it's quite low at least in this country i don't feel like the KGB is monitoring my phone or anything like that to surmise to surmise it is there well i guess although i well that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because uh if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest and i'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded um-hum yeah um-hum um-hum um-hum um if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it well then i guess one could assume one was invaded but i don't feel invaded by it um-hum um-hum i don't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things i'm not sure why uh i guess it comes from a sense of facts or facts and if someone finds out something about me that is true i i don't have a sense of loss from that um-hum well you must have a relatively clean conscience then uh the the other side of that might be uh if if someone there's someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense yes yes you'd be more harmed or something yeah because right because you don't have anyway to turn it off there did you hear about this Lotus database that was being put together yes i did i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there'd be could good possibility that their facts were were fantasy um-hum um-hum and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from me that i would rather they didn't and that might be the sense of a spending pattern for instance that that i would have thought to be private but then if it turns out to generate um-hum um-hum incorrect things that's even worse uh or if my call rate of of eight to or so a week went up even higher because uh someone had had um-hum um-hum they had you pegged right as a person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now their advertising you right exactly yeah yeah yeah and i one of the problems with the Lotus database was uh that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information i mean they said they would give it out to only select companies but uh you know just like software is only given out to customers i mean you can't believe that it would it would be pirated and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering right right you know full cash price for it i mean you know you can't tell what what a company really has to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having right virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are and you know and and that hacker just has to get into in touch with a sneak thief and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be you know an invasion of your actual home um-hum and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling threatened as a result of of it so so maybe that is a a little bit of what privacy is yeah yes exactly um-hum i also hm thought about it because i was uh waiting to talk to you that another thing that occurred to me is there's not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isn't but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someone's gonna invade my privacy very quickly and um-hum i realize that that i mean i can take that for granted but i used to i used to live in India and things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of privacy in fact it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy certainly a language i know doesn't but just has a word for loneliness loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different oh that's interesting but but no concept for wanting to be private yeah it's it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially okay um so there's not i mean doors don't have latches on them people don't tend to knock you just if there's a door closed you open it because it's in your way you people walk in and out and as a as a westerner in India i was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded oh that that would be that'd be culturally shocking you know it it very much is but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic uh-huh and people would leave me alone uh-huh whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of social of um public behavior um people start paying attention to you very much and they start asking q uestions and in a sense are invite invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms yes and which isn't alway always the case in all cultures and it wasn't until i was thinking about it just now that i realized that's actually something that's culturally relative that that is true i hadn't thought about that and and that is fascinating to to think about someone who doesn't know how to say private um-hum um-hum and they've really um well i mean i i wonder how people have sex and things like that i mean they obviously you go to India and it's obvious you know the results of sex are quite obvious as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years um but i i just don't quite um there's hope i actually for all for the time i've spent there i still don't quite understand how certain things that i assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy yes because anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which people will respect will respect and if that's gone um i i really really don't know how to live very well and i wonder i really do wonder how people do that yes that's interesting are there are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either growing on a growing frequency well the classic the other classic examples the Jehovah's Witness or or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door um which is more intrusive because i have to feel really tell someone to go away and there's that sense of i have now opened my door they now see what i look like what i live like and normally and they're doing something that normally i really only invite people to because i okay any friend anyone any friend anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me but no one is just welcome to come by my house so that is more of a sense of invasion so that's another example of the invasion because of a nonsolicited Arch how are you doing tonight good and yourself oh that yeah fine kind of tired yeah me too where am i calling pardon me where are you i'm in Lewisville Lewisville okay i'm in Garland um have you read anything about how they propose to uh come up with the taxes to increase the funding for schools little bit what do you think about it equalization of funding that's a hard issue to decide uh on the one hand you don't want to have to take away but on the other hand you don't want uh the poorer school districts to go under either and uh here in Lewisville they had a thing on the ballot that they wanted to uh rollback the taxes on everybody's houses and everybody would save uh-huh uh twenty dollars a year or whatever but it would cut back twenty million dollars in to the schools and i happened to know a good teacher here in the school district and she was really against it because that would just take away all all their money um-hum and as far as i'm concerned you know hey twenty bucks a year is not too much to me and they could raise a few more dollars and get better uh things for the schools that's what we need because we got you know Texas is known for it's poor schools and that's too bad because we got little kids and we're uh not too pleased about that but we're not funding them like other states either though you know it we're not funding our schools like other states either pardon me that's true that's right but just because we've got a lot of money doesn't mean that's gonna solve the problem yeah i know that's that's only part of the problem i mean i think there's a lot of waste in in schools i'm a teacher i feel that yes i feel i definitely feel that way all this money that's being paid for administrators i think we're gonna see are you okay i think were gonna see a day come yeah hum-um i can i think i think we're gonna see a day when schools uh grade schools are gonna be charging tuition just like colleges are uh and it'll only be to those who are having kids going to school that's probably the most fair way but you know uh that way old people don't have to have have money going to the schools because they don't have little kids going to schools but uh i wouldn't be surprised if that happens within the next few years uh that sort of thing happening and uh we'll see what happens well they're already talking about freedom of choice you know for schools that's an idea yeah yes um i don't know that i think has pluses and minuses because uh those that are economically disadvantaged won't have the ability to make a choice the choice will be thrust upon them and so where's the freedom of choice no freedom of choice in that case and that's that's true but like in Garland you can choose the school that you're going to can you tell this is past bedtime um like in Garland they get to choose the schools that they're gonna go to but they got to have the transportation to them if it's out of their district you know out of their area i mean yes so and i like that because you can find out the good schools in your area yes i think the only way they're gonna really get to the problem and solve it is to have equal funding for every school in the state whether you it's in a poor tax district or a high tax district and uh that's the only way that i can see it's gonna be resolved is there are gonna be people in the rich district that are gonna fight that and and it's gonna be a real bad mess because there's people on every side of the problem so just distribute it equally and not raise taxes yeah and they should give every teacher a a hundred percent raise that that's the problem is the teachers don't get enough money and anybody who could be a good teacher doesn't want to become a teacher usually because they don't pay enough i mean when i was in college i did a lot of teaching uh for my degree and uh i got a lot of good out of that and i liked teaching but i really couldn't go into teaching because it was not economically feasible for me to do so yeah what do you do i'm a mathematician oh so you picked a good field then you picked a good field pardon me oh i don't know there are better fields to pick well yeah but that's not a bad one i mean yeah where i you know kind of stuff i do i i use my education quite a bit but where i was before i wasn't using it hardly at all so it all depends i mean it depends on where you wind up i guess but i really enjoyed teaching it you know i but wouldn't mind getting back into it someday but who knows what'll happen in the future the way people are being laid off right and left it's all a matter of uh what happens next but uh back back to the taxes though i mean uh it's a difficult issue no one wants their taxes raised but on the other hand you got to do something yeah what do you think about a state income tax i can see that there might be a reason for one but i would hate to do that because uh that would be very difficult for my family financially to to afford a state income tax and most states have it i know and i've lived in states that have had it but way uh way financing is now if we had a state income tax i'd uh have a very hard time financing my house again you know paying off my mortgage each month that's so that's a problem um which just matter of we'll see what happens i'd rather have that i guess than have a state state lottery because when you bring but didn't they pass that thing that we were gonna have a lottery or not no it didn't oh which means there's a higher probability of now having a state income tax even though good old tax and spend Annie my favorite uh decided that uh during the campaign she said we weren't gonna have a state income tax and now she's gonna renege on that which i expected her to do anyway uh we'll see what happens i don't know at any rate uh so what about your income tax think they're hitting you too hard actually no um no i'm surprised that my uh my income taxes are as low as they are we just finished our income taxes and we're getting a nice little refund back this year which is which is nicer than having to pay out uh which is a matter of uh um i'm surprised it's well considering the national budget i think George Bush wanted one point four trillion dollars for the national budget and for a family of four like what i got that comes out to over twenty two thousand dollars that we it it's our share to pay in but i'm not paying that much income tax huh-uh and you're gonna think well wait now where's the other eighteen thousand dollars or whatever coming in where how how is that coming from me i guess it comes from companies and businesses and whatnot but it's interesting i don't know i can't imagine i guess that's why we're going in debt so deeply they bring in half a trillion dollars and they spend one point four and then the rest goes to to the national debt which just keeps accumulating i don't know what else do you think about them let's see the state that's about it i guess and the city tax the sale tax they used to you really didn't even think anything about it when you bought something but now you do it figures in what is it seven p oint yeah yeah seven percent or something it depends on where you're at some places in Dallas i guess it's like closer to eight and places like in Lewisville it's a lot closer to seven i don't even know how they figure it really i'm glad i don't work in a store hum-um how's that because i wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess they've got a little table though and it's all written out oh yes so it wouldn't be so bad all right so you think that's the way to do it federal tax is okay state tax you can see the logic of it but you don't think it would be economically feasible for your family and ours see both of us are teachers and we got four in our family too no yeah we don't need anymore and so when you start taking talking taking more out of your paycheck to go to the state income tax uh but we can do this tax sheltered annuity that's the only thing that's saving us yeah i think what we need what uh the government the state government needs to do is get in there and cut spending because when they got all this fraud and waste going on they need to just get in there and and get out the garbage that's in there right now i mean i once heard that uh uh for the for the federal government at least that if they uh uh well for like on the welfare system if they gave all that money directly to the people every welfare recipient would be making like forty five thousand dollars a year and you know they're not making that much money they're making probably more like five or six on the welfare so where's the other ninety percent going well it's going to the some fat guy in the middle who's sitting there on his behind all day doing nothing but filling out papers part lots and lots of people before they get it lots of people yeah yeah but still i work in southeast Dallas and a lot of my children are from poor you know socioeconomic areas homes and it's just like they always have money they they always are dressed nice you know most of them are fairly nice not like you would think a a poor person would be yeah and i mean they've always got dessert money or they've always got you know dollars on them and everything and i'm thinking you know this isn't right because my children don't have that yeah well i don't have that a lot of times if i've got a dollar in my wallet it's like boy where do i go where did where'd i find that yeah and you give them you know they get their free lunch and they throw most of it away but then they have their money to go buy dessert and that they eat wow you know it's just you see garbage pans i mean pails just filled and we pay people to haul them off right yeah right and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs quite a quite a world we live in that he yeah it is oh well is that you got anything else to say i don't think i do oh well yeah that's all i have to say thank you okay well talk talk to you later then bye um-hum bye uh how do you feel about gun control uh on the scale they gave one to ten i'd say i'm probably a four i'm not totally i'm not one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns but i don't think we should be carrying Uzis either you know what i mean yeah i know i mean i don't think machine guns automatic weapons i don't believe in things like that but i think some people do i know that everyone should have the right to have a hand gun in their house if they so choose and but i think there should be some restrictions when you buy one you know they should do more background search on you they should i think it should be harder to buy one right yeah there's a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a gun because they don't really ask a lot of questions when you walk into those stores yeah no they don't they don't ask anything except how old you are i don't think that's kind of scary i'm from California my mom the last time i was like purchased a gun my my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted like an antique one and uh-huh they he had to fill out some forms but i guess California might be tougher i don't know yeah they might be or you know how we are here in Texas it's like everybody's a hunter so i'm not much of a hunter but yeah it's i've never even bought a gun myself my dad's given it to me or someone's given me one so i'm probably real illegal you know carrying guns that aren't even mine yeah it's a it's a hard decision to make it really is uh the only problem i have with gun control is that they the radicals wanna ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people carrying guns are gonna be be the people who are gonna kill you anyway like the bumper sticker it's true yeah yeah exactly right it really is because they're gonna get them one way or another they will always have a way look at drugs they always have a way to get that so right right right and they're illegal so i don't think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together no i yeah i i i i i agree that it would be like people in people that are uh criminals are the ones that are gonna get them and then you have no defense against these people when they do come into your house or something right that's true i think they ought to teach people how to shoot them too how to take care of one how to act around one when they buy them yeah i have have gun gun have have gun management 101 right yeah exactly you cannot take the gun home until you've taken this course sign up here something like that yeah or required required required for every college student oh right exactly before graduation God gun control it's it's such a heated topic in the the and people get so emotional about it yep oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it all the i've worked with a lot of people that hunt and they just they they don't see any sense in it at all they think it's ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course they're hunters they know what they're doing they don't realize there're a bunch of crazy people out there that some of them are crazy too whew yeah yeah they go out there and get drunk and start shooting don't use it for that well yeah that's true they shoot each other thinking they're a deer yeah darn i thought you were a deer Bob sorry my mistake yeah Marge i don't know what happened to your husband he just never came back looked like antlers i don't know yep that happens a lot too yeah oh but i guess that's it that's my opinion on it so what now i'm not sure uh uh i think we just hang up yeah okay thanks bye i let's see yeah yeah we just say good-bye and hang up okay okay okay thanks bye-bye have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they're either offering a service or they're introducing some new product in the area and normally when they call you're either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone yes yes that is that one that you were talking about that was the big one i'm talking about i work weird hours and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall uh-huh uh-huh and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the click as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on um-hum or you hear somebody already starting reading reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already that's true or the ones that are are generated by a computer it's just a computer voice that comes on the line those are the ones that i really really hate too even had some of them the they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything uh-huh uh-huh yeah sometimes i i get them on my uh answering machine at home so and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them aren't from anybody at all what i would love to see done to stop all of this uh-huh we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted um-hum i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them um-hum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand so yeah i do i really feel that that's uh an invasion of my privacy i agree with you on that particular subject there let me see that's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences i put a stop to some of them as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people um-hum peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their salesman salesman to come out um-hum um-hum yeah that's true living in an apartment complex though you know you can't um you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there's people coming around you know and they're trying to sell something or or they're from a religious organization and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago and um gosh it was about nine o'clock at night too it wasn't even what i would consider you know a family hour it's time to you know start going to bed and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and uh i've read a lot about uh that particular sect and i don't particularly care for it so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me now i agree with their right to um pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment um-hum i'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them otherwise i don't want to know they exist right yeah yeah no i i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then that's fine with me too you know as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in and and i don't like the way that they do it either and and it's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go out into the public and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work and i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at all and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have guessed i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get yeah yeah that's true yeah no i don't uh i don't have i didn't go that far but uh yeah i probably could do the same thing uh you know i don't have a storm door but i'm sure i could rig up something but you know i don't think that that would stop people i mean it's like they they see that word and it says uh go instead of stop oh goodness wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment oh gosh but i consider invasion of my privacy yeah yeah a harassment in itself yeah yeah yeah that's true that's true hm well what else i believe we've pretty much summed everything up i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else and i can't remember what it was and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door i'm drawing the blank oh goodness okay is our five minutes up uh pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you pretty close well it was nice talking to you too Jim and take it easy now good night okay thanks bye okay we just bought our first home after being in school and so we're just first time homeowners who've only been living here about six months oh okay um well i've lived in the in the Dallas and Richardson area for about uh twenty five and a half years twenty six years oh boy and we're in our second home now we've been in it for uh about thirteen fourteen years i think now in Richardson uh-huh oh so you're you're an old pro then we've lived in the Richardson area for that you know for the full time uh um-hum well what do you find having to be like out there i've always heard that it was expensive well it's it's not really all that bad uh i think you live in Plano so uh the the Plano area and the Richardson area probably are are about the same pricewise i would think um-hum oh really hm yeah so well we uh when we graduated from school in Houston uh my husband went went to school at Rice and got his PhD so that that's what brought us here and um we had um heard a lot about Richardson being a good area and the homes there being really nice and but we kind of just got the impression it was out of our price range yeah yeah well um i know i i think that there's some areas in you know in uh Richardson that may be a little bit higher priced but uh of course it like i said i've it's been thirteen years since we've really priced a house so um-hum so i'm not sure what the prices are like now uh i know that our price that the the value of our house went up you know considerably over over a you know uh oh an eight or ten year period yes um-hum but then for the last several years it's pretty well stabilized uh and perhaps even dropped back some from what it was so really hm but uh we've done uh you know in order to maintain ours we've done some remodeling and stuff you know just to to kind of change do some some little changes occasionally so yes uh but uh i guess i'm i'm a little encouraged with home prices i i'm a CPA and i was just talking to one of my clients uh yesterday uh or you know over the last couple of days well that makes sense and they have sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one you know that was was more reasonably priced it's uh in Dallas but it's in the Richardson School District um-hum hm and the the lady is very pleased you know she says it's got everything she want's you know thinks she'll ever want in a house and it was several thousand dollars less than the one that they sold so oh that's good so i I suppose that the housing market is uh you know it is on the on the down side right now well do you have a lot of homes out there that have um foundation problems that seems to be the pretty much the rule out here well i'm not really aware of those i do know that that our house uh we've had to have the shower pan in the master bedroom replaced twice hm because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that uh-huh because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that but that was a design problem because we put uh and we designed the house so it's our fault but we had them put the shower on a corner uh like our house is built in a U shape and in inside that U but on one of the corners uh is where that shower is um-hum and so any shifting in the foundation of course or or you know i guess i feel that way anyway that that that shifting would cause some problems in that in that area of the house yes and of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of uh of metal or plastic whichever it is anyway so so did it look cracked to you i mean that's how you knew it was broken or no it uh it started leaking through the you know out through the pan and out onto the floor and it's soaking up in the Sheetrock or in things right oh oh so that's that's how you knew well since like i say we're first time homeowners i'm still scared about everything like that going wrong and how do you know it's going to happen and all yeah uh but uh yeah but i think uh you know i think so far as uh as the location Richardson Plano are probably comparable the the school districts are you know are about the same uh you know quality wise um-hum we really like our school out here yeah so but we um we were scared to buy a an house in our neighborhood because all of the homes did have these foundation problems and we didn't know um you know if we were afraid we'd be living there and all of a sudden the house would crack in half and split open or something um-hum yeah but uh well our house and i'm not sure how all of the builders you know how most of the builders do but ours is what they call uh post tensioned which means that there are iron bars you know that run through the foundation um-hum hm and once they get the foundation poured then they they apply tension to that iron bar which compresses the concrete and makes it more uh stable more stable and and puts more strength into it um-hum so uh you know it it uh potentially that's supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the you know when the the earth itself shifts around so well that's good well that's really good well our house is older it's like a nineteen sixty three yeah so house that we bought so i'm not doesn't seem like it um i mean i know so much has changed in their technology in the last few years um-hum yeah right uh is yours a is it a a slab foundation or pier and beam it's slab yeah so that's and that's what ours is our house the house we had before was over we live on the east side of Richardson now and the other one was over on the west side and it was uh a pier and beam house um-hum um-hum and uh i just drove by there this morning and it still looks just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago so well that's good yeah so you know i think houses uh i think they hold up pretty well if you've got a if you have a good builder yes my grandfather was a builder and so my parents always lived in houses that he built and then they knew they were getting a good deal so yeah well i uh appreciate that information about Richardson i know it was um it's got a really good reputation and okay yeah so well it uh you know i think it's a a good place to live uh or course if i didn't think that well we wouldn't still be living here so fourteen years that's pretty good well thank you and well um you good good luck with this program then bye-bye right yeah that would okay thank you uh okay thank you you too um-hum hello this is Lois hello hi hi this is Lisa and um i called you know from that the the TI Database Calling Instructions um-hum yeah i got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though yeah this is about changes in women in the um-hum uh there's really a lot isn't there i mean there really is yeah it's kind of an easy thing to talk about oh i guess the work force would be the main wouldn't it it uh yeah um i think you have to push one and then we can start recording it okay all right are you ready now okay like i said i guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in the generations okay yes yes i know because i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her i guess she's in her late forties you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids and i've never faced that at all um no i think now now you go to work when they're six weeks old you know and you stay there and i feel like the next generation you'll probably just work right along with your husband you know uh-huh yeah um-hum i think it's definitely gotten better oh i do too much and it's just gonna get better it really is um-hum because women are in every field now i mean i can't think of a field that they're not involved in oh i can't either not a one i know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field i don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing um-hum yeah even in Washington you know there seems to be lot more women involved yeah hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i think that would be the best goal yes yes oh i do too just your qualifications and that would be it uh-huh exactly not what color you are how old you are what if your male or female that would be wonderful i guess it's kind of an ideal world though huh yes yeah yes um yeah yeah i kind of think maybe in time that you know you'll go by social security numbers you know and that way they can't say well they picked the male over a female or female over a male you know you yeah yeah yeah exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your age or anything i think that'd be a wonderful way to do it yeah they'll just i do too just go by your social security number and then look at your qualifications that you know that you have um-hum and then and if you get it you know then um-hum also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what's it called job sharing like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or um-hum oh yeah uh-huh as a matter of fact that's what i'm doing um-hum it sure is it sure is is it that would be great or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on LOA to have her baby we hooked up a a a terminal at her house um-hum and she you know we could send her messages and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two and that worked out great too oh uh-huh yeah yes that is i mean that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it all it was was you know i mean she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office um-hum yeah so i think that's real nice too to come up with different options do you like the job sharing oh oh i do i really do i think it's great do you do you work like half days or half weeks or uh well like one week she'll work three days and i'll work two and the next week you know i'll work three and she'll work two we just share off like that hm oh is oh that's great uh-huh do you get the full benefits um-hum yeah we get the full benefits but we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under yeah oh that's wonderful yeah especially with children and so many things going on that would be great yes it really is and that way we're not really missing anything out you know of those children uh-huh either way yeah you have your career and your home life and that'd be a nice way to especially if you have young children um-hum yes oh it is it is well both of ours is school age but we don't want to miss any of those PTA's and you know all of that so so um-hum oh no i think yeah my son's just in day care but even that they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that you're involved in that um-hum yeah yes i think it's great i really and i look for more of that in the next generation yeah i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful um-hum um-hum yes oh i do too yes plus i bet it cuts cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything so you don't have to you know unless you're just really sick or the child's sick but yeah yeah because most time now you know it's just a weekend or just forget it yeah um-hum oh yeah i have to plan way in advance because or what i've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours that's been real helpful too like my doctor stays open till nine in the evening uh-huh oh yeah so that's real helpful so you don't you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour i don't know how many times i've done that to do something post office or the bank or any uh kind of errand to do yeah um-hum yeah i think we've really come a long ways in that because yes so uh-huh i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just it's always been that way but i know um-hum yeah but i can remember remember back growing up my mother i mean it was she always worked but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick and i know she probably didn't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did oh yes um-hum where oh yeah yes i think there's still some discrimination there where as you know men and work women work in the same job i think men get paid more but i think that's improving it's such a slow process it's frustrating but oh i do too yes yes yes i mean you can see that it's wrong and you just wanna make it right but at least the wheels are moving forward um-hum they really are yeah i think it's getting better not worse well i should probably get back to my job i know i know the feeling well it was okay and i sure will and bye-bye call again okay bye-bye hi hi um okay what now uh what particularly particularly what kind of music do you like well i mostly listen to popular music i uh listen to it all the time in in my car so i i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i don't like commercials but uh i find myself listening to popular music and yeah uh quite honestly i i have some little children and i've unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of uh nursery rhyme music here lately but that's not by my choice how about you oh really well um i don't have that i don't have that uh experience to share uh i i i do i do listen to a lot of you know i do i switch the stations stations a lot because i don't have a cassette player in my car um lucky you um-hum uh however i do i do i do like a a lot of different forms of music so i switch quite often um i i think i like uh i i'm really particular about the type of music that i listen to but the uh there's there's such a wide selection i think i like a lot um-hum or i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music you know i i it i i like music that is that that i feel if it's performed correctly or if it's done right or if the version is done right i like it but if it if it's not then i won't i i really don't yeah how do you feel about rap music it seems to be so popular these days rap yeah well i i don't really have anything against rap music i do the one thing i do object to about rap music is is it um-hum when it becomes militant or if it's uh violence oriented i i'm i i really i have i have strong objections to that um um-hum right actually i listened to one time i remember it's this is back when rap even uh i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i when it was really just starting yeah yeah right when it was just starting i heard what was called talking blues which actually is rap and uh it was about the the piece of music the piece of music was about i think about forty or fifty years old and it was incredible i mean the parallels you know between it and rap uh-huh uh-huh right and um you you listen a lot if you listen if you listen hear a lot of old gospel um uh especially well the black gospel you know you will you know you can really pick it up i mean it you yeah you really it seems to be influenced by a lot of different music a lot of times you'll hear songs that you know they're not original but have been put to a rap kind of a rhythm yeah and uh sounds the sounds so much different and yet i i have a a much younger sister who listens to a a lot of rap music and yeah uh she thinks it's pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she's listening to and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces yeah yeah they they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards i guess you could call it yeah so i think it's kind of absurd you know the fact that you know they don't really they don't really that's right give you know the original artist or the original composer the credit that's really due to them no yeah i guess there was even a a bit of a ruckus caused by the MC Hammer who's really you know seems to be the hot one of of today he used um yeah Wild Thing do you remember that that song he used i can't remember who the artist was on that yeah um-hum yeah it Jimi Hendrix was the original Jimi Hendrix was the original he wrote who was it well maybe maybe it wasn't that one then because it's a living it was a living person that i'm that i'm thinking of that um that said you know hey okay that's those are my words and uh i guess that they're they because he hadn't originally gotten um permission from him to use it and he he since then has has amended that and um-hum paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on but yeah i don't know it may've it may've been somebody else because i think i think that even Jimi Hendrix did a i think that was a cover i you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of like a John Lee Hooker song or something i mean it was like it was really old maybe so i i can't think i mean i i it it a lot there're a lot so many different songs i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times i mean i've heard some songs that that i just thought were horrendous cover versions and i'm like you know i i don't wanna listen to this because you know you think of the original it's like you know oh that was really great that was a you know yeah really good piece of work and then you when you hear the cover it's like you know God you know what what are they doing to this oh i think i think a good one was um there was a Peter Frampton song well right they destroyed it oh yeah yeah and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was absolutely it was pitiful i i remember seeing the video of it on MTV and i thought it was hideous it was oh i didn't like that either yeah there's yeah but you know whatever became of Peter Frampton i mean there was nothing he was a phenomenon i mean there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything i remember i saw him in a concert when i was yeah yeah i i think i think that probably yeah i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer i was in high school um-hum he was very good i remember i saw him in a huge stadium in um Philadelphia it was in JFK Stadium it was i don't remember yeah oh man hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like yeah i've i i graduated back in seventy nine so but but i really i i loved i mean i was um-hum i was really into the album oriented music even then so i was really familiar with a lot of with a lot of the AOR type music um the the album oriented like the uh James Taylor and um-hum oh yeah the uh the Beatles and you know i mean a lot of people they go you know they're better than the Beatles and i'm like you know you you don't know what you're talking about hm no oh oh i mean you know comparison the comparison made between New Kids on the Block with The Beatles i mean it was just you can only laugh yeah you just sort of you know well i guess i can just humor them you know at this point but right well they i guess we our our age is showing when we when we think that yeah but well well you know i mean i i've i liked a lot of the new music i think um um when i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out um back in the um-hum yeah in the mid and early eighties and then um i don't know music is kind of in a weird it it it's in a very weird position right now i think that i mean i like you know things like to hear you know like what they call world music which is you know using all these natural forms of music and yeah yeah Paul Simon well you know really that's not world music but what what Paul Simon's doing i think is is is is great because he's like Paul Simon yeah uh you know i think i think that you know using a i guess what they call it is eclectic you know using drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a a synthesis of a new type of music um yeah what do you mean by world music well world music is um a lot of the a lot of where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener uh for example let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of music um-hum a with a certain style and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for let's say another audience let's say a North American and then when they hear it it it it's a really it's another form of music and you know it's sort of um trying to draw out the best sources the the best of every type of music uh-huh huh right because i mean there are some i mean i like there are some you know types of heavy metal that i really like but but i wouldn't i wouldn't say that i i completely like heavy metal i i think you know it and it's the same way with world you know world music takes no the forms that have really been um i guess i you know the best example or you know the cream of the crop i guess you could say and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that extremely enjoyable and then taking so then it becomes a kind of music of of it's own so to speak or hm yeah yeah it becomes a kind of music of it's own i mean when you listen to it it's um uh i think that they don't use electronic electronic some of it it's it's they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably uh-huh so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now and from West Africa that's considered world music because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles right but they're they're trying to make it somewhat more modern i i a a good example another good example was i heard Miles Davis and Miles Davis worked with Ravi Shankar if you can believe it i mean you know he's this jazz performer and then he's playing with Ravi Shankar who's a very good uh-huh uh-huh he's a very good arranger uh arrangement to but uh were going to get off i don't know but no yeah okay but yeah i mean when i heard his album when i heard it and it's just incredible they are they trying to stop putting in a little interference okay we've talked our five minutes though oh i've been listening to that a lot lately yeah i i listened and i heard you know you hear this sitar and then you hear this the muted trumpet and i mean you never think would think that they that they can actually play together but go together yeah okay so um yes we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago we have a computer here at the house and i made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month uh-huh uh-huh and then basically since then what i've done is is keep track of it through the checkbook so that based on whatever we've got coming in check coming in and how much i'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also spend and because our house payment is once a month that's our our biggest uh expense so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck even though it's really still there uh-huh uh-huh so that i can keep a a good balance running total yeah through the month what do y'all do a running total yeah uh we've we've uh taken how much we have you know write down how much we have coming in each month and then uh we've at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend we sat down made up different accounts like you know we've set a budget for each you know household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our our own fun money and just stuff like that and then we write down each each time we spend something we write down in a book and end of the month we tally it up to see if how close we've you know we we try to stay within a certain budget so um-hum is it is it hard to keep track of it or does it work out pretty well um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it but it it works out real well so um-hum and and you're staying within your budget and keep everything is working pretty good uh-huh yeah yeah i stay within i have to stay within it so i yeah i found you know and then we have that you know if you can't stay if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something and something unexpected unexpected comes up then you're not um-hum yeah you know you don't feel it so strapped you don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and and do that right yeah because we don't you know we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month yeah that's a good choice we've been trying we're trying to uh do that this year we've budgeted the money that we used to spend we were spending on a CODA account with TI and then money we were also buying stock with for that year we've taken that this year and said we're gonna pay off all of our credit cards and uh uh-huh you got paper under your table uh-huh we have a another loan with the bank and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that we'll be free and clear uh-huh to be out of debt free yeah the only thing we have it to pay off is our is a automobile loan and our house payment and that's the only thing we ever we try to stay out of debt so yeah that's good to be in that kind of shape what are y'all trying to do long term uh-huh oh as long term we just he has you know his retirement plan and then to CODA and stuff like that that's all we've and you know we just have our life insurance for right now uh-huh so we don't have any long term you know in stocks or anything like that right now so yeah mostly what we're doing we've worked we've done the uh CODA account with TI where they we put in so much a month and then they or so much a paycheck and then they match it yeah that's what we're doing so and so that that has worked out pretty good and then i used to work for TI and i have when i retired from there or left i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an IRA and we had an out yeah uh-huh we had an existing IRA so we have both of us have some money in an IRA that we're also trying to figure to put it we're putting it in CDs right now and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund uh-huh yeah whenever we get enough saved we we stick it in a CD for a while and then uh um-hum you know and then when we if we need it we wait till it it's expired and then so yeah the other thing that we've done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um Hancock oh John Hancock company came out and their agents did a long term analysis based on salary and uh what we were planning what what what our uh goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement kid's college paying off the house buying a different house uh-huh um special thing buying land and building our own house and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at uh-huh and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals and yeah or not or what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and money we could put in at what time or not yeah uh-huh that sounds interesting we've never done anything we have you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know and he's set up uh you know determined how much we need to um-hum you know we need if something were to happen um-hum yeah that you know that's the other financial thing i guess that we've done is with our life insurance is since i'm at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me yeah right yeah you you know if i would sell the you know if he something would happen to him i wouldn't stay in Texas i would uh that's a a big thing to think about sell the house and move back home you know to my home town and and uh i wouldn't stay here in Texas so um-hum yeah you know i don't know what he would do but okay i guess that's most of my um financial plans right now is is there anything you'd like to add yeah mine too nope that's about all for mine okay well it's been nice talking to you nice talking to you too bye-bye bye-bye all right okay uh we've got a lot of them too many of them oh yes and i believe we all do and it's it's just too easy to use yeah well my husband's real good at using them oh i believe that uh mine would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much i don't have any of them i don't carry them he carries them i try to take them away from him um it uh you know i seem to uh use those more than i do cash in fact i'd rather carry the cards than i would the uh cash yeah well we got in a spot of trouble with uh using uh the credit cards on gas uh yes and uh that's got us in trouble yes that's real easy to do i have to watch it yeah in fact yeah uh we i can understand that predicament um they they've um you know they've they've made them too easy and too accessible at everything to to buy the ATM machines oh yes those things there that's what gets us and then plus then you for end up forgetting to write it down well no he doesn't have that trouble he uh has this little slip that comes out with the uh ATM machine and he just keeps that he keeps fairly decent records oh uh-huh oh that's good but uh he knows when he's overspends and when he doesn't and he knows that anytime he pops out that credit card you know i've used the credit card a couple times to pay bills oh yeah yes uh and then then that gets into a vicious circle yeah as far as you know paying off the the the loan that you just got from the credit card to pay off the other loan yeah that's what he's talking about doing now oh no um yeah the ATM's they're but they're nice though to have in case you need to get some quick cash and everything is closed yeah well yeah i like them i i have to admit i do like my credit cards uh i love it when he decides to go in a store and buy something for me oh that's the best way it's used that's the best way yes now i think that sort of evens it out as far as uh letting them carry it so as long as they do buy us something yeah i don't know i like that he walks in you know and he's got this little gift and how'd you pay for it credit he you know said whipped out my little card and see there's no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it yeah i'd never thought about that way i don't really look i guess i ought to sometimes oh i have to open it you know they mine always charges the flowers so i can always end up saying oh you spent too much you know and so yeah well i think the best thing he bought for me off of them is a Nintendo oh those are fun yeah you get started on them and can't quit like credit cards oh no never thought of it that way either he's you know he's addicted to it at times just exactly oh it's it's real easy to get addicted to them you know you get out on a shopping spree frenzy and uh just charge it all and then you don't have to write a check or anything and see the thing is you know he go out and he'll spend it when he wants you know and uh uh i'm afraid to i'm afraid to use that credit card yeah is there is a a fear to it as far as what happens if yeah you know uh is he going to yell at me for buying this with this you know and he's not a yeller though but he calmly you know you shouldn't have spent it all on that yeah they he likes to buy the kids toys with the uh credit card too you you know he'll go to by Wal-Mart or something and oh yeah that's it oh yeah there's that's a weakness there that's just you know you you always want to get your kids everything and uh you don't care how much it costs or what it takes yeah well uh i don't know the uh uh the uh Wal-Mart that's where all of our bills are for the credit card uh-huh yeah that's uh i always end up going into Wal-Mart and coming out with everything that uh i didn't have on the list we're just getting more than what we went in for but we went in for uh uh something for the car one day last week and he went we went and bought a potty chair uh uh one of those Ninja Turtles for my son uh you know the potty chair for my daughter and he bought the uh-huh a pair of shoes for me and uh let's see what else did he he bought a couple pairs of shoes for the kids you know i got two kids and he bought them shoes with it and uh oh yeah it's dangerous you know we went in for a ten dollar piece of thing for the car and ended up sixty seventy dollars for uh at Wal-Mart and then we went to Payless and bought the shoes for the kids um-hum oh yeah it's just too easy to do you go in for just one thing we're we're infamous about that and so yeah i'll second that oh well yeah i well i'm i'm glad we have credit cards that's uh because in sometimes when there's an emergency it it comes in handy yeah it's nice to have i know we had the car break down one time and the uh credit card saved us yeah we've yeah we've had uh a sick animal and uh the vet you know the dog and vet's are so expensive that uh we uh the credit card helped us a lot there too so we wouldn't do without them i don't think we'd live huh-uh no no i think it's become too much of an everyday life here they're part of it yeah well i've been asking my husband for the credit cards i've got all of them but one i just hide them from him and when i feel that it's necessary to pull it out i'll pull it out but he keeps one of them he keeps the one with the least amount of the uh uh what you call it yeah no the uh the balance credit line you know uh the credit limit i let him have the one with the least amount oh yes uh-huh so you know he can't spend too much yeah you know uh i don't really exactly remember how much it is i think it's about five hundred limit uh you know it's just uh just one for him to fiddle with yes um-hum i have to think of something else i'm i'm blank i was i was just uh oh well let's see i guess we've talked what almost five minutes well six minutes i've got a timer on my uh oh clock on my phone oh i wish i had one of those well we bought this with credit too well we found it with a clearance uh down in Memphis i guess and uh oh see there you go popped that credit card out it was a Sears oh your up in Memphis no i used to be i'm in Texas oh your in Texas oh okay i was i was going to go goodness they really got uh this out far well i i don't know i don't know how far it goes yeah yeah i'm down in Houston are you in Texas oh i'm in uh down here in Sherman or Denison rather oh okay yeah um-hum well oh this is uh this is great this was the first one i had first phone call this is my first one too uh-huh my husband did one last night and he just loved it he's been getting he got a real good topic huh so well uh you know we got to get back to credit cards yeah well i was just trying to think uh i think we've pretty much said it all it um but so uh but yeah uh i think we couldn't make it without them i know i couldn't uh we went and we maxed out quite a few of them before uh i started taking the uh cards away we maxed out a lot of well we had about six or seven and we maxed them out um-hum and uh that's got us in a little bit of trouble now that's why we and we was using one of them to pay off the bills on the others and that got that in trouble there yeah yeah but uh we uh we try to keep a uh uh tight controls over over them but it it gets hard like especially around Christmas time and birthdays uh uh my hubby does not have uh too much control when it comes to using that card uh i know uh uh for quite a while we was using them to uh i think even one time we used it to pay our rent oh goodness you know it uh we first moved here we just had a little bit of trouble and we got in to too expensive of a house or apartment rather and uh you know he was only down here for one day uh-huh uh-huh and we just everything just piled up wrecked the car and you know in order to do that we had to you know we was paying oh the rent plus trying plus trying to get the money for another car another car and it gets rough it got it got real rough that's hard he just popped out that uh Master Card and get that cash advance uh-huh yeah we got big cash advance and really that's what's uh holding us back now that's yeah it uh it but see it does come in handy those they do they're worth it oh well i i think we've pretty much come to an end here yeah i'm trying to find out how long we're supposed talk i think it was at least five minutes wasn't it that's what i'm looking for now that's why i was just trying to talk without having to think about what i was saying and uh trying to look over this thing okay wonderful touch tone telephone there uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading uh having have uh i have a wide variety of of hobbies therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide um i get a charge out of uh Texas highway uh which uh is very colorful and uh not being a native of Texas uh but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh oh about the different areas of of the kind of the state by reading it right i've read that one too i only had a subscription once but my mother always gave me hers and i i really enjoyed you know all the little things that you find out about Texas oh yeah it's it's uh absolutely it's great the way that it's broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things it's pretty pretty neat um oh i like photography um magazines i don't take a subscription or anything like that um things oh being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and uh-huh and uh kind of strange because i it's not unusual to uh see um an engineering manual or something laying around the house and then i'll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it but uh how about yourself uh-huh well um i have an interest in art so i frequently purchase and read um books mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment um-hum oh that's great and um oh i guess i like a variety of things um lots of fiction uh type books um right now i'm occasionally reading on a book about uh the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and it's history that's fairly interesting um-hum i bet that would be rather interesting uh that's uh self-improvement that's that's always well that's that's kind of a hobby but it is self-improvement uh from the standpoint of probably relaxing um yeah i i don't know that i read anything strictly labeled self-improvement how about you um well i hate to yes i do we um we have these classes we attend uh management classes then and they give you books and and the last book uh matter of fact i read was At America's Service by Carl Albridge it talks about um who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the TI culture here at Texas Instruments yeah um one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is uh-huh uh so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer your my customer i'm your customer sort of thing um right every now and then i'm loaned the tape i can stick in the in the car cassette on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of Pat Haggerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type yeah actually which all you know betters yourself yeah yeah well i guess maybe i am into some things occasionally that i don't think of in terms of self-improvement um-hum i mean they are but i don't label it as such like what for example well i don't know um i uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things but um they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself you know getting getting your yourself in gear to um-hum uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really wanna do convincing you that you need to get on with it sure sure how about items like um The One Minute Manager which used to be a big okay so those are self improvements um yes sure our supervisor uh suddenly bought all of us a book called What Every Supervisor Should Know um by a main man named uh Doctor Bittel B I T T E L and it's a very layman's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people and the very last chapter and i haven't figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers so it's it's very it's interesting here again it's it's casual reading and it's not eaten up with a lot of uh technical stuff and it's really uh excellent fast reading and uh but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's you know i think if somebody wants to say okay read these ten books because these are self-improvements i would probably be turned off to them yeah yeah he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and uh picked up one of them it might be a little more interesting i don't know i i'm not sure i could take too much of Stephen King that's a little little little heavy for me yeah they're uh quite uh they're hard to set down because it's so interesting and course they're always a little spookier than the movies but uh yeah it's always they're always challenging to get through one of them i have a hard time finishing books well i guess i also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what i'm involved in a lot at work um-hum in quality especially nowadays uh that's almost everything that comes across the the the the the airways of the oh yeah you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other but i think sometimes the word is a little over used but exactly exactly right yeah we we have i think we we name drop it a little too much and and don't fully understand what what what it is we're saying i think it's it's focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and and all that kind of rolls in together there but uh yeah yeah yeah that's kind of part of it okay well any other comments uh not that i can think of um i think i'm under my quota a little bit i need it if i if i make a phone call or two well we just started right ah this is true i've enjoyed it well you too and uh have good-bye have a good day bye-bye good-bye all right Amy how are you doing today fine fine oh all righty i think we know what we're going to speak about um tell you what i'll start off how's that yeah okay you go ahead um i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back um-hum hangings on weekends in public places in public places there is one state that does that by the way yeah really what is that i want to say Oklahoma i saw report something the other night about it hm they don't do them real often which is obviously the death penalty yeah yeah um but i think if we quit uh building these Taj Mahals with the color TVs and sixty dollars sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with and let's just screwing up the system uh yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months that's pathetic that's pathetic it's because they just say there's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them or you know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know what's his whim to decide it should be two months this is true and and and and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to you know it's crazy life in prison then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole so what you know let's quit BSing with the system yeah well even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for starving children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that exactly so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really a life for a life i mean there are so many just major major serial murders and it's not just like one instance or something it's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on the old Charles Manson case i mean the guy is really yeah and the yeah there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um just shouldn't be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge yeah um-hum the the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene uh when there's uh my understanding when there's uh a verdict and it for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth two day in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off uh he was uh he he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay right yeah i heard about that on the news yeah um kind of gets back to the second request we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict the a situation like that i'd say no let's just go like a regular vote eight to four tells me that there were eight there's a percentage certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey right rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a fortune you know a fortune to keep doing that the guy's guilty exactly and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution exactly because it's not next day they have the start the trial which is X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more right yeah yeah i think that that if it's if it's not a split decision uh go with the highest number and let's just get on with the program yeah yeah uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there's a jury because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision um what are your feelings yeah yeah well if i i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from Florida and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a judge that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side and have some judge that was paid off or you know had good a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway i don't know if it prevents it but seems like the jury system does have it's advantages but i also i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know and i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group it's not just random people hm it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know that have on a list are the ones that are on the jury and that's it yeah yeah i get back to Price's comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break you know you know he'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something yeah exactly yeah yeah i mean you're you're in Dallas so everybody i can't believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence you'd have to be pretty dense yeah you'd be in have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to Lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer yeah oh they'd have to move it to Taiwan for people not to know about it practically this is true so true well this has been an interesting conversation yeah yeah well really this is breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors i mean what can i say no i'm at home with two little kids preschoolers my husband works for TI oh so you're at the house you're not at the plant oh hold it oh that's good that's good i thought i heard a holler there in the background but i wasn't sure so yeah oh yeah i've got the dog and two kids waiting here i am locked up in the laundry room okay thanks a lot bye-bye oh goodness well i'll let you get i enjoyed it bye okay um i don't know about you but where i am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like everyday i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next were it's pretty bad but it's true you know they tend to try to be you know real lax and supposedly the policy is like you know we you know we hire these wonderful creative people and we don't want to smush their creativity you know we want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want and you know you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next well i'm kind of that way too i work in the legal department and where we are now what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents yeah and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day it always seems like i'm doing that and i can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry you know boxes of documents around so if i'm just gonna be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down but if we're going to have a meeting where we're having the attorneys come in or people from uh other party's attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up yeah and i'll wear a dress and hose and stuff yeah yeah you know we're kind of that way too i try to i'm the same way you are i kind of try to judge from day to day i know you know where i am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and um-hum and you know if i know that they're gonna be there you know you you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up and if i know they're not you know i i've been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know and it's just so it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress you know it is so um-hum that's right that's right a matter of fact i thought i had one funny story when um i was at TI the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes we had them in the warehouse and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road and it wasn't air conditioned uh and if we were there like in the middle of the summer it's unair-conditioned it was dusty and dirty um there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it and so we didn't really know we weren't supposed to we thought TI dress code was just dress appropriate to your job we wore shorts we didn't know that was a big no no uh-huh oh no and a supervisor from another area came up to us and you know this area where record retention is there's only a few people that work there and he should he knew who worked there he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there uh-huh and he came up to us and he just said who's your supervisor well he called our supervisor and our supervisor's supervisor and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts oh no he didn't at least say to us did you know you're not supposed to do that that could have alleviated a big problem we ended up getting called out on it oh how awful sounds like Mister Power Hungry but you know just yesterday though i saw a girl in the spin out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts yeah uh-huh and i don't care you can call them split skirts and you can call them culottes all you want but these were shorts is all they were i mean i i don't care what else you call them you know if they're below the knee okay maybe you can call them split skirts if they're above the knee they turn into shorts you know and these weren't even really full ones i mean they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were you know the real wide full ones you know and because these weren't even those these were like um-hum pretty short black and they were very dressy they were black velvet shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very very nice hum but you don't wear shorts to work you know i mean as far as i'm concerned she was in violation and nobody says anything to them it's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime you know if they just you know the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an um hum cut off you know that yeah no this is where we're going to draw the line this is shorts you know and and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that you know yeah hum so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well God we have a pair of those at home too it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know but well i've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine and they have said no yeah uh yeah and then during the week you see these women in the you know just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore you know yeah i mean i've never seen them do it without hose i mean they always have hose on but still it's they're shorts i don't care what you say they're shorts you know well i think TI's dress code is pretty lax considering everything anyway you know i i know i didn't know that EDS has a very strict dress code i had a friend oh oh do they really definitely i had a friend who worked there for a year or so and they spell it out for men it's particular suits uh the pin stripe and the particular colors of shirts and wing wing tipped shoes oh it is definitely lined out oh my God women are not allowed to wear slacks she wears coordinated suits i could i couldn't afford to work there and a and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel oh it is oh no spelled out when i was looking at her materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff and it told about the dress code and it said uh-huh these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and hair just this way yeah TI says no shorts and no halters you know that's it and EDS is very particular about this hair cuts i mean it was like you can't have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just really detailed wow i don't know that that would be a good environment to work in i mean i i see i i am more i don't know about anybody else and a lot of bosses may say i'm nuts but i am more productive when i'm in pants i i am i work faster i get things done faster than when i'm in a dress and heels you know i it and it's weird but i it's i do i i can i can get so much more done if i'm dressed comfortable you know well the uh the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had uh another person coming from Washington our outside counsel and she was told that we were gonna be in a warehouse but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse right and she came with skirts just like she'd be going into the office yeah and we'd try we'd try to say didn't you bring any pants or anything we're we're out here in the warehouse you know you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes and you're gonna have to unload unload your skids look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid uh-huh you can't do that in a skirt poor thing and she and she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt she finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants but you know i mean it was just completely miserable for her oh yuck yeah that's terrible that's terrible gosh well i don't know i just figure you know yeah sometimes i worry about you know if i go in in pants and i never i never ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know but i'll go in in pants i mean today i had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and a and a like a peach colored top and you know not cruddy but not a dress either and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you don't dress in you know your dress for success business suits everyday if um-hum you know if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on but you know i don't know if they do or not you know i see a lot of the managers and they're in jeans so you know some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel and it's funny because there's one that always wears a suit a matter of fact he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned really wow and then there's another one who's who's a little younger and a little more yuppyish and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt and sometimes he wears the jacket to it uh-huh yeah and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt so that's just you isn't that funny you know with the you know the little suspenders or something on so we that's great we've kind of had a variety there but i think a lot of times it's it's mainly who they're going to meet with they're they're meeting with people that they know is gonna be dressed that way then that's how they are if there just gonna be meeting with TIers yeah like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the they're engineers that they're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they're usually casual that's the way to do it i mean that's the smart way to do it it really is because your making you know if when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in you know in a six hundred dollar three piece suit yeah it's gonna make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable you know or it would me you know it's it's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here yeah yeah look at this slick guy i wonder what kind of money does he make uh-huh i can see it now well it was good to talk to you it was really enjoyable yeah this is this is kind of a fun project i've done i've done some of the other speech programs but we've never got to talk to another person it was always just talking to the computer so this is a little different it really is oh yuck yeah well it's kind of enjoyable i'm really looking forward to it well thanks a lot bye-bye yeah okay bye okay um how's it been this week for you weatherwise or otherwise weatherwise weatherwise damp cold warm hum-um oh no damp we have we have gone through what might be called the four seasons uh in the last week uh-huh we have had highs of seventy two lows in the twenties my goodness well i don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then it was ninety six yesterday i heard about that yeah we set a record yesterday and uh very very windy but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature so very cool uh i think right now it's like sixty nine hm and that's cool for or if it it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant no rain in the last month i don't think ground's very dry and our yard work everything everything is in bloom so our yard work's pretty tough uh ground being dry but i guess it also uh brings about allergies we're having a lot of allergies down here right now um-hum everything blooming and and the weather and uh think a lot of people have contracted uh spring fever too so had a lot of people out at work you know for fishing and and uh golf reasons and things like that the blue flu yeah yeah the blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work i guess yeah yes oh we have had uh as i've said we've had variable weather uh hm it has been untypically wet for this time of year hm and also we have a lot of green you know the grass has been growing and if you look outside you would like to go out and mow your lawn if you could go out and hm buy a new spark plug or something along those lines but fortunately it rains and you uh do not have to go out and buy the spark plug no but we've had an unusually uh uh warm yeah spring and well i guess we're still in winter and uh um-hum we have had no snow to speak of to speak of no snow hm we usually average oh anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter and this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation hm so it's been inordinately warm uh here for uh for this time of year so uh in that regard it's it's fine but uh hm um-hum i envy you you're at ninety four degrees i thought i heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday yes yes it is down in uh more southern and and western areas and of course we're um about two hours from the northern border straight south and yeah and uh very windy it's amazing to me because i've only lived in Dallas three years and i cannot believe that the wind blows all the time it does i i i very seldom if any i can't remember you know a day that i walked out and the wind wasn't blowing um-hum well i spent six years in graduate school at in Indiana in the flatlands and it was that way everyday rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour hm summer and and winter so that uh we you you became accustomed to it i guess but uh otherwise uh-huh we as i said we have had a uh relatively mild winter for speaking for this area of the country um-hum oh really where did you go to school in Indiana Purdue Purdue i have a brother that lives in uh uh Southbend Indiana oh yes and i had to always well i've lived there for eight years myself i'd always said i was gonna go back to school and go to Notre Dame but i didn't uh well you are not from that area originally i can tell no originally i'm from New Mexico i was born in New Mexico and we lived in uh Southbend for eighty eight years and uh then moved to uh Tennessee actually oh okay well um-hum well i thought i heard a little Tennessee in there and uh very much very much because i i spent thirteen years there um-hum and uh then moved to Dallas about three years ago so gee you've moved almost moved around as much as i have yeah it's uh uh uh uh my father was in the Air Force so oh i see well i worked for the government so i i moved uh uh much more frequently than i had intended uh for sixteen years but uh-huh i guess the uh this this is my first conversation in this uh uh series oh uh-huh i had i received a call last night because of the uh i had not received my uh personal identification number right so i had to call Jack Godfrey today and ask him what it was because i i had to abort the call last evening because i couldn't get on the line yeah so uh is there any i'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk it's um it's just as long as you want to i mean it's just a oh okay as long as you want to and just you know a reasonable lengthy conversation now uh do you work for Texas Instruments uh no i do not i work for GTE oh okay and i uh of course was i was sent a uh an application from uh from Jack i've known Jack for sometime i'm in the um-hum speech processing business and have been for a number of years so i was very much interested oh really yeah in in being a speaker for this oh actually i i work for Texas Instruments and um i'm in a i'm an environmental engineer oh i see and uh they just published this internally you know getting people involved so that that's really strange i i was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though i was thinking God do we have a TI in Maryland or um-hum i'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative um-hum and um but i have uh i have been an a speaker in other uh similar type of activities uh and i know the reason why this is why the uh this is being um-hum gathered and the program and so forth so i was interested in as i said i was interested in being a speaker um-hum we haven't talked much about the weather i know that's what we're supposed to do oh well yeah yeah well really it uh the the letter just says um let's see i can't i was looking at it i was trying to find out speedy short cuts and all it says not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and and end it when needed so um-hum in environmental engineering uh okay um-hum is that with regard to workplace engineering or just you know environment the work place environment or uh well it's actually um waste water taking taking care of uh i'm actually in the air division and we monitor um oh i see anything that comes out of a stack or out of a building or um we do have customers that um their concerns are in the work place and we take care of that but in within um-hum our department we uh take care of everything waste water uh solid waste and recycling and and air well i had my the the call last evening was supposed to be about uh concerning recycling in the community the call i received oh uh-huh um-hum and so i had uh i had thought a little bit about it um uh um-hum beforehand oh uh-huh so i but that that's interesting i have a um uh a friend who is a planner oh uh-huh uh a city planner and one of his and he models uh city districts and so forth uh does computer modeling um-hum yes and one of the uh he has inputs or gets inputs from a an environmental engineer uh-huh yeah we actually our division is corporate wide and we take care of just the Dallas area course we have several plants here but um we do air modeling also to um-hum oh i see and and yeah i take care of all the air modeling specifically for the Dallas area what we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed and wind direction and and uh we have a huge chemical data base well that's interesting and uh our our chemical data base so that we know every chemical on site and and um it's concentration and and if if anything ever happened God forbid you know a building explosion or something like we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station hi Diana hi have y'all been able to do much as a family these days pardon me have y'all been able to do much as a as a full family these days all of you oh yes we've um been um we've gone other you know all kinds of places we go out to dinner we take the kids to the park and um yeah you know whenever we he my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo or we you know we we do everything we can possibly as a family do you work outside the home no i don't yeah i don't either it makes a little bit easier i think that way yeah it does and and then uh you know my husband enjoys spending time with the kids you know he'll he'll take them out just to be with them so he they can have time with him and yeah so you have a break too right so and we uh we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home you know we have we try to spend like Monday nights we call it family home evening and uh-huh have our kids um you know have little lessons with them and you know just see count see how things are going in our family and you know teach them about their grandparents or something like that bring out pictures of them so they get to know them and we just do all kinds of fun things like that and uh we have family that's far away it sounds like you might too yeah we do so they you know the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures so yeah right and um and phone calls that's about about it yeah right and uh you know they we you know we go to the park or we go in the backyard and sit down and that's what yeah that's what we mostly do pretty simple things especially since my youngest one is excuse me only fourteen months she she's really getting to the age where she's playing and likes to go places yeah right uh-huh yeah and with you know me being at home and just having the one income you know you don't have this lot of extra money to to do a lot of you know extra things so you you make more fun than you know you know the kids just think it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or that that's right oh that's a big thrill for them yeah or um you know go get a bag of M and M's or something like that they they think that's a lot of fun so we just we try to spend as much time as we can we you know our whole our whole weekends are divided are devoted to our children except for we might go out you know one evening or something but yeah during the day you know it's all devoted to our kids and they come go to church with us and yeah that's true so yeah so have um have you ever been to the Science no it's called the Science Place yes yes that's what we just we haven't lived here too long we went there couple weeks ago uh-huh the kids thought that was wonderful and uh oh yeah we i guess there's Science Place One and Science Place Two we've only been in i think it's Science Place Two i is i'm not sure which one we went into it was about a year or so ago when we went the one we went in had um the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a like a kids place area that really seemed i mean they really seemed to go wild in there uh-huh yeah yeah yeah they had a lot of fun in there and um there's uh there's some petting you know like uh uh i think it's Owens Country Farms has a free petting you know like a farm that you can go to and the kids can pet animals and stuff where's that that's on Plano Road um it's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road it's like a little bit past Campbell on Plano Road uh-huh uh-huh and that's a lot of fun they have tours going through there and oh yeah um the kids think that was a lot of fun too and oh that does sound like fun it's a little bit of a ways we take you know whenever we take them to Showbiz or they think it's wonderful just to go to McDonald's you know they don't go for the food they go for the to play around and oh that's right there's another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business uh-huh and it's a indoor fun park and it has a bunch of different rides for kids that sounds fun too and parents get in free and it's like during the week it's like five dollars admission for child all day and and you said about about Plano and Campbell is the petting the petting farm yeah that sounds fun i think maybe we'll try to do that yeah yeah and the one in Mesquite is um Scyene exit uh-huh and it it's uh the kids just had a wonderful time there they you know you just pay that admission and then all the the the rides are free you know they of course they have all the little video games and you know those little quarter rides you know to and stuff like that but they thought that was a lot of fun you can have birthday parties there and yeah i think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza because there's more for them to do because they can just do you don't have to have tokens for everything yeah yeah right so they had a lot of fun that does sound like fun well i've gotten some good ideas from you yeah i we try to do a lot of things as a family and you know inexpensively as possible so definitely yeah well i think i don't know if we've done five minutes but i'm sure that'll be yeah that'll be good yeah well it's good talking to you be good was it good talking to you i had a good i really appreciate your suggestions oh no problem well take care bye bye okay bye bye so what do you think uh do you know any people from Puerto Rico uh yes i i used to work with a guy from Puerto Rico when i worked for Hewlett Packard oh really and uh he was a native and had gone to school there and got transferred to Colorado where i was living uh-huh uh and he had some interesting times getting used to it um the United States the the language was a little bit different although he did speak English yeah have you ever been there it was just some of the excuse me have you ever been there i've never been there my dad used to work for DuPont and they built a chemical plant down there i almost moved there when i was in high school really yeah no i've never been there either i've not known but just a few people from there uh-huh one uh there was a girl in in my flight in in uh Air Force basic training actually who was from there uh-huh okay uh my dad flew down there for about a year he was down there about once a month one week per month uh-huh and uh i wanted to move there it sounded like uh a neat place to live an island in the sun you know and uh oh yeah it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didn't want to go because she didn't play golf or tennis and there wasn't really a job for her there it always sounds more oh its i think i think everything always sounds more glamorous than it really is yeah every because i spent five years in Europe and everybody goes oh you're so lucky and i'm like well yeah sort of you know it's but having lived there it's not it's not anything like you picture it uh-huh yeah right you know it's not it's like i still have the fantasies about Hawaii and all that stuff but yeah i lived in Colorado for a while and people kept saying the same thing to me oh it must have been great and your just like yeah well sort of right i go oh it was just a place to live yeah i was but um what do you think about about um their situation should they should they become a state i i think the status quo seems to be working i don't think um from talking to Jerry my friend that lived there that they don't seem um upset about it or anything and yeah i think it would upset more people if they tried to change it really i i think i'm not opposed to it but when its when the time is right it will probably just kind of happen you know yeah i don't know fifty one stars on this flag wouldn't look too good where are they going to put the other one yeah if they got another state they could bring two in and fifty two might be able to uh be arranged better i don't know well where are we where are we going to get another state yeah i don't know cut California in half or something or Texas no that's not a good idea but um i know a lot of the major companies kind of like it because they'll build plants down there because they don't have to pay taxes on the stuff oh yeah um and they make i guess it's no income tax there or federal no federal income tax something like that oh yeah because it's just a territory or is that what it's called a territory yeah um yeah i think it's a territory okay that makes sense i mean there's uh lots of tiny islands in the South Pacific that are territories like that they could make states like Guam or uh is that a U S territory though yeah it's a U S territory and it's just we own it or that would be kind of bizarre yeah that's kind of far well Hawaii is pretty far too think about it well that's true but there is not a whole lot between here and there yeah where you you start dealing with Guam it's like you know flying over all these other places to get there yeah it's definitely a way out of the way where where as My dad was stationed in Guam during the World War Two though uh-huh yeah where as Puerto Rico is pretty close by yeah which i don't know of course you could annex Cuba but they wouldn't like that a bit no i don't think they would i don't think they'd go for that yeah but actually i knew another guy from Puerto Rico that i went to school with um-hum and he was coming he came to America to to go to school and i think he was going to go back be an engineer out there oh yeah do you think he was really funny both of the ones i met have been really funny guys i don't know if that's uh if that's true about all Puerto Ricans or not ones i met have been pretty pretty funny no i have no idea but uh so you think that mostly they're they're pretty much satisfied with things the way they are yeah i don't i didn't hear any major complaints about it um i definitely think that we ought to let them decide and not say okay you're a state now or you're your own country or whatever yeah exactly but um let them decide really that's why i said you know when it when when their time is right when they're ready for it you know that it will come about yeah yeah i think that makes the most sense okay hum well Rick it's been good talking to you okay have we have we been on for a long enough time i think so i think its they want like five minutes or something don't they okay yeah this is this is actually the first time i've i've had someone call me so oh okay but uh it went fine okay bye-bye all right well it was good talking to you Becky bye-bye okay i guess we're on yep Central America have you ever lived in Central America i wasn't in Central America but uh talking about Latin America i kind of i consider Latin America to include Central and South America and i did live in uh Sao Paulo Brazil for four years do you do you think that that we should have given up the Panama Canal uh realistically realistically i yes i don't see the the Panama Canal that hasn't had a whole lot of usefulness to us recently since it's not not really big enough to uh accommodate the the shipping that it once did and uh maybe it would be better that we let the Panamanians run it however i think we're certainly justified in uh our actions dealing with uh Noriega in this well there are those that that that think that that that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic importance particularly for the military interestingly enough my father was who was in World War Two and as uh as a civil engineer they they they offered him a commission as a captain if he would uh go in and and uh help with the defenses of the Panama Canal he had worked with United Fruit Company uh-huh there and they uh they in fact they had this was in uh the late twenties and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over and uh he turned them down it it's interesting that that most people don't realize how small the canal is have you ever been there no i haven't it's it's really i i haven't been there i've been to been to Salvador and and uh in fact we went back to visit some friends of of of my fathers that we went in fifty seven i guess and interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite quite easily the thing i find interesting though is that uh is the whole colonial approach and and and do we do we support the Sandinistas or or do we support uh you know when they thought uh they thought that Nicaragua if you gave them a free election they would vote for the will you uh did did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in Nicaragua i i have a a little bit i can't say that i'm i i would be an expert on the on the region but uh certainly uh i it it gets it gets there you you've got this this toss up between or not not so much a toss up but a a dilemma when when you want a country to have it's it's um own uh dominion or its free rein over its its own people and then on the other hand uh the uh the government in power that under what seem what seems to be popular support uh Sandinistas had to a given extent popular support um starts making overtures to the Soviet Union and and into what we consider our sphere of influence and now we're we're in this dilemma over uh United States is believes in Democracy and and self-determination where and but that on the other hand we believe in self-preservation and uh agree with the or not so much agree with but are terribly concerned about the influence Soviet influence in in what's considered to be the United States' fear of the world which is not only you we used to see spheres but now we're in a situation where the United States is looks like we're it now well the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic i don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua uh and there were uh there's a big there's a big lake um-hum and um from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua but the the United States uh had some and i've forgotten what the political influence was but there were economic ties then the issue of of of if if it's in the economic interest of the United States uh do we go in and and prevail and and uh in other words do we make the world a safer democracy but if there's no economic benefit right and i think particularly if you're if you're looking at the at the at the peasant uh whether he's in Central America regardless of where he is is his life is his life better off under Communism or or uh or Democratic government you look at Salvador where the well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his uh his family yeah and and the question is is does the government make a difference if they'll mostly leave him alone uh and i think that's the difficulty they that that we have that uh it it it reality doesn't make uh doesn't make a difference if he has no income and apparently even some of our alleged uh Central American leaders that uh are are that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things so it's uh yeah oh you can look in if you pretty if you look at the region and and on to their detriment they came from uh this uh hundreds of years of Spanish control in the in the Spaniards have a horrible history of corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers who uh have been uh i don't know manipulating manipulating their public for their own their own good i mean if you go back to the kings and then the the conquistadors coming in and and the whole the incredibly horrible things they did to the uh the native tribes i mean they make uh they make the things that Custer did look like uh like trivial and uh you get it it's it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting and and and Americans have uh have a pretty good reputation of exploiting you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and and took it oh absolutely and now we set up and uh we stole it fair and square i think is uh and i mean Ted Teddy Roosevelt didn't have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for uh for nothing and uh well what's going to be interesting is to see what the economic impact of of uh of the the region uh you know at the moment it the tremendous drug traffic through there but uh the idea of of uh right what's the what's America's role there and it it uh with with other things going on it it it seems to have lessened but you've still got uh Cuba that exception exerts some influence i've the only the only thing i see about Cuba though is uh after Fidel Castro dies i don't think there'll be Communist power anymore i i can't see Communism in that country carrying on past him well when you take a a situation where i think in particular in Salvador where there is a significant under under class excuse me and that uh having a a a lot of difficulty uh surviving uh the question is would they you know would they be better off under communism yeah and i wouldn't don't know that i would advocate communism but uh the question is can a can you can a can a democracy uh afford the it's like the street people that are starting to show up all over the US is that that's essentially an underclass and when you get enough of them right uh you know Communism would feed them all yeah well i i don't know if maybe Communism's the right the right word for it but what we would there'd have to be some kind of there there may be a point at which at at which you've uh you might want to consider some kind of socialistic uh organization or socialistic setup to to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a Democracy well that yeah if the guys got some incentive if he's got uh you know if if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas to uh where he's got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest to him right right but cocoa leaves sell real low right now yes it seems yeah as as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments absolutely absolutely i don't it's gonna be hard to um we've that's you that's you that's that's where you're absolutely right as we've got to do something in that region to encourage uh or to make to make him growing bananas profitable again i mean yes but the but the question is you know if somebod y offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it right well not that we could be bought but uh i got to watch what i say here i never know when the DIA maybe uh listening on my phone right well of course all everything we're saying is being recorded and yeah uh it's tempting it's got to be it's got be horribly tempting for those for those of course of course because yeah yeah yeah you it's not just it's not just a matter of uh of having an particularly if you're hungry extra car or having a better car this is a matter for them of of feeding themselves their wife and their family and and you there's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family and there's dishonor in not being able to do it and uh starve to death is not a not a whole lot of fun either and that uh and and and oh no you know when somebody comes in and offers i think that's one of the real problems particularly when when the uh religious organizations you know the Catholic church has been accused of a lot of things in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people um-hum and help them protect themselves not not that they i'm i'm not sure the Catholic church is is is particularly particularly political but right you know if somebody's hungry okay uh my favorite show is Masterpiece Theater and it has been for a long time but i feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because i've never met anybody who likes it do you by any chance you do oh yes yes very much well wouldn't you know as a matter of fact i prefer public television uh-huh and uh i have particularly enjoy the English comedies yeah and the English mysteries yeah i watch Mystery too um is is that what you're referring to okay yeah that is good i like uh do you read yes vociferously okay well that's the reason why i like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books and the plots are more yes uh challenging you know than the sitcoms of regular TV well unfortunately for us at least here in the United States we the only access we have to that of course is public television yeah and i i'm not a great television watcher in in any respect uh but uh the watching what i do watch is uh usually news and whatever is on public television uh any kind of i also uh am very fond of great performances in in that regard uh-huh yeah me too but uh did you stay up late and catch this Red Dwarf oh that was a scream no uh no uh no as a matter of fact uh Turner Broadcasting uh-huh has been uh broadcasting all of the James Bond movies really uh-huh every night this week so i have concentrated on watching James Bond movies this week huh i used to like him too he was my hero in fact i like Sean Connery to this day well they're showing uh Live and Let Die at this moment and it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as 007 uh-huh yeah yeah so it it oh he could never cut it no no that's true i was just thinking that today he well in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate in the early movies whereas uh Sean Connery has maintained the yeah yeah he does i how would you ruddy uh look uh but uh uh-huh yeah i liked his accent too oh yes yes and he can even be in movies that are not uh uh sexually oriented and he still comes off great well you know he was uh when was it last year or year before last he was voted the sexiest actor in movies or something yes yeah he had my vote double i mean the man is sixty two years old if i don't care but uh otherwise you know we uh with you know PBS and so forth and i i particularly enjoy i don't know whether you've whether you had a chance to watch it on PBS but uh uh-huh the series uh Yes Minister uh what's that about that was about a the interior minister it was a comedy the interior minister of uh in England with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that oh yes yes uh-huh right i like i've seen it several times it's a scream but i had to go to bed i have to get up and and work the next morning i wish they'd put those that's why i say did you stay up late to watch this Red Dwarf it came on after Doctor Who on Saturday nights here at least um-hum um-hum and it's just of course i don't you know you really it was i don't think they should show it on during prime time but still yeah it was funny yeah i know well i i'd i as i said i'm not much of a television watcher i read as i said and uh quite a bit i i read about uh-huh two or three novels a week yeah in addition to all the technical stuff what do what what do you do what kind of work do you do i'm a payroll clerk just an accounting clerk at TI no uh i have a friend who works for TI and uh i work for a a tire service here in i'm from Dallas oh i see um-hum well the last two people who have called both worked for TI and i just wondered huh yeah yeah it could be TIers uh i think probably are participating more than anybody else but um-hum i needed the money this is five bucks here yeah really do you work for TI i guess yeah i i guess we all can no no i work for GTE really how'd you hear oh we're not even supposed to be talking about this though are we in Maryland yes well that i guess it it doesn't yeah how did i hear about it well i work you know they're gathering a database for voice processing and that's my field of of work also uh-huh so i i know the people at TI who are doing this and i heard about it so i called them and ask if i could could participate and uh huh yeah you know sent in the forms etcetera and uh so forth huh right we could go back to television shows if you well you know speaking of public TV have you caught any of this series on the Bible yes i have i've heard that it's really against the well i mean that it's coming out with the idea that the Bible's not true well no that's it you could interpret it that way uh uh-huh i think what they're trying to say is that there is a great deal of historical truth but the interpretation that actually got into the um the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh after the what uh was it the King James Version when the committee uh-huh uh did it wrote wrote the uh the or translation that so much was lost in the translation uh particularly since most of the translations most of the translations were from Greek yeah uh well for example uh in Greek there are seven different words for love right okay so you can have there's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one ler word for you know love uh love of uh your father and that sort of thing so in those translations those types of interpretations uh really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now and what it says so that you know it's it you know you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true but there's too much historical uh-huh fact involved just from the uh the histories that are that were developed around that time that are available huh to deny that at least you know the majority of it is true so you know you know it depends on how you look at it yeah you can look at it if you know if if you want to say that it's proving that it isn't true then you can you very much look at it that way i guess if you're looking for that you're yeah hey you could well you can interpret that the what the TV show in the same way you can interpret the Bible well uh so but uh uh-huh really but uh i as as far as that goes i at we at we at least agree on you know on what we enjoy in that regard but uh yeah that's right i don't know if there's a there is a time limit on this so uh yeah surely we've made it well it was nice talking to you okay you too bye-bye i think so too all right well it's been very pleasant talking to you and have a good evening good night yes um i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for Puerto Rico i was a resident although very young of the state of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty nine when Alaska stopped being a territory became a state uh so i guess i have a left over positive feeling about the question even though i don't know very much about Puerto Rico um i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive uh and i kind have a suspicion that that i believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go one or the other what is your situation well i'm i guess i don't have such such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do um my concern is the economy because as i understand it Puerto Rico has a very low standard uh standard of living or at least um annual average income um part of this i suppose is justified in in in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of the the more northern territories need however in that case i guess i would favor status quo i have been to Puerto Rico and and found it very very interesting i did Peace Corps training there oh that's very interesting and so um you know i saw it also as a young student and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in California and so the Spanish was no problem um it was it was you know very lovely and and the people seemed very friendly and and nice i have actually i work with uh a girl from Puerto Rico and i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors uh your concern on the economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on Puerto Rico or pressures on the US in terms of aid or well probably more on in terms of the US um you know i'm i'm not quite sure how the US copes with this sort of thing i've lived abrode abroad most of my life so i guess i i've been very cut off uh i lived actually in Lebanon so i was very cut off from the the press as i was you know and uh becoming was becoming an adult so i don't know how the US would cope with it a um-hum new state that is so very very poor um-hum um i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of like New York and and how much aid it needs i suppose the whole country or the whole um new state would require such aid i guess um we're assuming that that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say Mississippi or i think so okay that's something that that i guess i have not much of an image of other than than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something uh not in a pejorative sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest and and and also difficulties they have um-hum um i don't know whether state would statehood would improve their economy i don't i don't know that the very the act of being a state would would have any impact on on them uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now but of course if their economy is weak that there is not much of a base on which to tax i don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being since they aren't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be how do you feel though about well i guess it's to their advantage to be a territory but uh i wonder how having having been in a territory but only as a young student and my parents were in the military at the time so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in the states in the Alaska at the time since they they voted absentee i i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a second feeling of second class citizenry uh to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote the District of Columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times in their not having a Senate representative um-hum yeah those those are good points um which obviously i'd never thought about um i don't know what uh i suppose they also not being a state are probably freer to determine their own um ways of life than they would if if i i'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory um-hum perhaps compulsory education uh i see what you mean so that um and taxes yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring uh there i don't know i i don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation um frequently the laws in a territory are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states i uh and i'm thinking in terms of education but then again each state sets its own and i don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico um it's interesting because i hadn't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to uh economy uh i had thought of it more in terms of political uh realization and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the US than an independent country um-hum well well actually i think one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that so they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway um-hum so if they've just taken such action it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish or Hispanic heritage uh-huh that's interesting well it sounds as though you are in favor of uh status quo i i believe i would probably tend towards that and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these so i'm ultimately i guess i'm ultimately in favor of status quo also well that's interesting at this point leaning towards uh statehood right what about if if um they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our states and i i constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions about against that decision even if uh Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something um i don't think there is any prohibitions i would be bothered by that i'm i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of America's strengths and that's the the the melting pot uh i i um-hum am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but i'm troubled by too close a clinging to to the the past and i'm also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country um and Canada i guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever uh that i i think that would be a a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that um i'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far as t hat it intrudes it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect um-hum um-hum that's interesting because although i tend to be bilingual Spanish based on experience uh i was in bilingual education in California and i didn't have any problem with my students but i noticed my my brother who who was uh quite a bit younger was learning Spanish in elementar y school and he can't speak a word hum and so obviously it didn't work in California yeah but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language right right but i'm i'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level oh i see um i'm i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess um-hum um-hum well i think we have gone to time and i appreciate your having called okay okay well thank you very much good-bye bye-bye uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes what um well um my my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class he's an aerobics instructor uh-huh and um is going to be uh entering North Texas for uh a kinesiology program there um-hum and um the the how i met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach um-hum you're a student yeah so i'm i'm an avid aerobics uh person and just very very athletic enjoying a you know uh anything dealing with sports uh-huh um-hum um-hum so and how do you feel about it um i'm i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise i i don't feel like i i don't very often do things for the sake of exercise i don't feel well unless i am exercising and i try to do things that involve exercise but i very rarely do things like um i've never done aerobics or any sort of structured this is my exercise time um-hum but i do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh you know mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that and i spend a lot of time and i probably get more exercise than your average person but it's not a a structured sort of thing and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake and perhaps it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun or something like that um-hum yeah well i i've my that's the way my mother stands on it she feels like if it's something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it then it becomes it becomes a chore and and she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore um-hum um-hum yes yes so um and i feel that way too as far as you you know just sitting and doing you know to the idea of doing fifty sit-ups or something you know to um-hum um-hum you know a a calculated you know calculated down and do your calisthenics you know three times a week or but but i do try and um um-hum um-hum um-hum i do try and regulate how much exercise i get a week yeah yeah is that why you like aerobics classes because you're not sort of someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore yeah and it's got and i've always enjoyed dance yeah so it involves you know i i can't get out to dance all the time yeah would that we could and yeah and it's and it's more regulated i mean you're you're using different parts of the body so it it is like dance and and it's structured like um-hum um-hum that but you have the music and someone like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me yeah um-hum and someone else is telling me okay you know let's let's move this way let's move that way instead of me having to think about it so much um-hum um-hum right you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself yeah yeah but i'm like you i also um like to participate in uh things like well we just went to the uh Myerson Symphony Run this past weekend and and that was a lot of fun and you get to meet different people and um um-hum um-hum just get out you know out and about and it's it it's something you can all like our we did it as a family so it was it was quite a lot of fun and biking and i i i love to swim so i love it when you know it's um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum swimming weather and uh hm well you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming weather oh i didn't realize that i'm sorry well i'm in Texas i i just assumed that i had this is the first call i've done and i didn't realize that they had were gonna uh reach out to people from all over the country so it's the it's it's the the active well it's actually it's interesting because there are real real regional differences um in California there's uh almost an assumption you wouldn't know that oh i um unless you're sort of clearly of an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that i'm i'm i'm uh there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness and and at least in urban California and maybe not i don't know about rural California too well but in urban California it's just you know for all i know aerobics started out here i don't know where they actually started but they you know the craze really picked up big here and before that there was the running craze and they California gets you know tends to be a bit faddish but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere so there must be something to some of them and uh um-hum well i think people are are more encouraged people from California seem to be more health motivated all around i mean as far as the diet and everything uh the diet and uh just your your your health consciousness and i mean it just seems like uh a lot of those ideas generate out of California not just exercise but health health related um-hum yeah ideas and i it's curious i don't know why don't know if it's do you does California have a well there's a sense of it being a package i think there there is a sense of you know whole there's a lot of you know you'll get organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever and uh oh the University University University the University of California at Berkeley puts out The Wellness Letter which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter um-hum monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that and and it doesn't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything it it's on fairly solid solid scientific ground uh it's just dispensed with these distinctions it says every all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together and uh so it's had that orientation for quite sometime um there's been some progressive medical schools out here um-hum that have taken that approach and um now do you think that's because they've realized that for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are motivated that way so that they've incorporated that into their program do you think the program came first or the boy yeah that there's a i i can say there's a correlation but i couldn't say which which caused the other they sort of developed you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more yeah the more money they put into it i can see that because i knowing from institutes of learning like that i know that they've got to get their money somewhere and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it so yeah and some yeah yeah exactly and part of it is California you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements and some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them um had an impact on the society around here and one of the ones that had an impact was um people becoming interested in alternate practices i don't know if it was a meditation practice or sure it was you know which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to uh AMA approved medicine um you have you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here and and you could have them around long enough and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things and before long um-hum you you get this this whole kind of Gestalt this whole package of of health of health care and options um-hum and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them the irony is is it's people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented towards doing the exercises and i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers last thing pardon me yeah or they're older well don't you think they tend to be older in the rural area i i i sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city i live in a rural area so you know i see the oh like everything else yeah yeah the rat race to exercise it's it's yeah it's it's like it's frantic to you know to uh achieve something that that a person in a rural area um almost doesn't worry about it to such a degree but um-hum stays you know more healthier you know as a fit person yeah well i i think so i mean you you've if you look at certain if you look at other cultures like i know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in China and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation and um-hum they seem pretty you know they don't have the hard body they don't have that perfect look and an awful lot of exercises is sort of image conscious but they you know they live to a hundred and ten some day you know and that that's yeah well don't you think a lot of that is diet too yeah and a lot of that is diet that's true yeah i mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat um for economical reasons not for preference um um-hum yeah and as we can see well i'm a i'm a practicing vegetarian so uh i've read a lot of information knowing that to be true what's that yes as am i actually i as am i oh are you also well that's that's good as far as the calisthenics is that is that um pretty predominant as far as California do do yes it is in the urban areas yes most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now in the urban areas um-hum oh that's wonderful well most most modern sort of modern looking restaurants will yeah that's great i mean we uh it's such a trouble it's such a trouble here i mean you just have to eat at home basically you can i was wondering that because i was actually applying for a job in Texas and and and uh it occurred to me well of course in the cities yeah well in the cities we live close to Dallas so um which um-hum you you know you get uh an influx of a lot of people from all over the country so um-hum um-hum you're gonna have a lot of more choices but in urban areas it's you know steak places an and it's not a you know it's uh it's definitely it it's it's changing to a degree but yeah yeah yeah um it's very frustrating and even even with health food stores and stores where you can buy natural products or uh yeah organic you know materials and foods and things you don't really have that i mean you would think um-hum um-hum um-hum i guess we're um uh we're we're experiencing uh what to me i guess is a surprisingly mild uh winter uh we've had a lot more warm weather than usual and we haven't had any ice storms uh usually we have at least one um course i've only lived here three years but uh but that in still in that three years you could always count on at least one ice storm my husband's been in Dallas during an ice storm he said that he pulled up to a stop at a stop sign and completely stopped just slid to the side of the curb that they're that bad Lubbock yeah yeah yeah we get ice storms but not not quite to that extent it's not the thin sheet you know all across the road ours if it ices over it's thick it's with snow it's something that you can drive on you can get a little traction with yeah yeah uh i think we've been fortunate that we've missed any of the real bad weather this year because we went to California instead but right now oh um we're having unusually warm weather it's it's almost like they're trying it's trying to skip spring and go straight to summer it's either yeah uh thirty degrees you know one day and ninety the next and and we're missing the fifties and sixties in there somewhere right that's right it's it's the same way here how long have you lived in Lubbock well i have been here permanently or full time since nineteen eighty and uh uh-huh pretty much off and on since seventy four so really quite a while and i've watched the weather shift you know i can remember being here back in the seventies in college and the spring dust storms were wow yeah uh they were massive i mean you could stand on one side of the street and not see buildings across the street dust storms whoa yeah that dust yeah not fun to be in but i haven't seen any like that in probably five or ten years huh so it's it's changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are cold but i guess i can live with it well i know when we first moved here it was uh it was at the very beginning of the year nineteen eighty seven um-hum and uh we when we left we moved from New Hampshire where it was snowing um-hum and we got here and we just couldn't believe how warm it was i mean it was in the fifties and we were taking off our winter coats and we were all dressed like Eskimos and uh and then soon after we had this big ice storm uh where everything was just covered with like an inch of ice and everybody uh and it was obvious that nobody knew how to drive in this weather that's true and uh we were feeling very cocky because course we always in New Hampshire you always have that kind of weather but um uh and i just i just assumed that was the way it was you know you didn't get snow which was nice because you didn't have to shovel it and but you always you could expect to have this ice storm and i think there was in the three years we've been here there's been one other ice storm um you the second year we had an ice storm and i was really surprised that uh that we didn't have anything like that this year well now does Dallas get snow or is it usually just the ice storm it it uh well it if you get any snow it's barely enough to hide the brown grass okay you know and uh certainly nothing that you have to do anything about um well that was one reason why i figured that i could stand Lubbock Texas that was about as much winter as i could get because i grew up west coast sunshine green leaves on trees yeah came back here and could not realize why i'd been so depressed through the winter yeah and realized that that was the first time in my life i had seen trees lose their leaves and uh and course when spring and everything came out again oh uh it was beautiful but that's about as much winter as i can take i mean it gets cold here and with wind chill it sometimes gets you know fifteen twenty degrees below because of the wind sure right yeah but it's not six feet of snow and it doesn't stay on the ground six months out of the year and i know the sun is coming right well that's the thing uh with us too it's uh just we just you know in up in New England you had more winter than you had a summer summer and uh you could expect a long winter period uh for instance um um-hum we could you could uh in New England it would still be cold i mean ice cold snow kind of weather uh now in March it just in March is is just when things start uh approaching the fifty degree mark and course we've already had eighty degree weather here and day day before yesterday it got up to eighty eight i think yeah well now when did winter start there you said you had more winter than summer oh winter would start oh yeah winter would start uh in September it would start getting cold in September now was there actually snow on the ground all that that time from September through what March there could be yeah there could be and and it came i mean i used to i used to work in Boston which was an hour and a half away oh goodness uh-huh and i would get up at five o'clock in the morning just to shovel out driveway oh and that's so i could leave by seven and uh so i would sometimes take me you know an hour or two to shovel the driveway in the morning and then i'd sitting in that car for an hour an a half and and well it was actually if the if the weather was bad enough to shovel snow it would take me three hours to get to work oh my goodness so and so now it takes me ten minutes well now was that expected though i mean employers expected people to not necessarily be there on time due to the delays or oh yeah uh well they not they didn't expect you to be on time but they did expect you to be there and you the schools well you know they also did a very good job of of shoveling the the streets yeah they had the snow plows and the salt trucks and and uh they just you know they were equipped for it whereas here if you have a bad snow nobody's prepared to do anything about it you know the everything stops yeah right right you know you you you'd you get the first you know the first first ice uh storm and the place closes up well now do you work at TI yes uh-huh i was gonna say there've been several times when i know they had ice storms down in Dallas uh that we would be up here trying to call and it we'd figure out after about the first hour that there ain't nobody at work yeah there's nobody there yeah yeah i that happens a lot i i just live ten minutes away and i don't work i don't work in the at the Dallas site i work at the Spring Creek site which is which is in Plano oh okay and uh and so i usually i can usually make it i n it's just a hop jump and a uh whatever the expression is i'm i'm real close right um but uh yeah i'd i'd hate to have to get it go to Dallas drive into Dallas when the weather's like that hop skip and a jump there you go well that's good well are you uh do you prefer the kind of weather that you're getting in Dallas over your years in New Hampshire or do you miss the winters or oh yeah oh yeah well it's like i keep telling people you don't have to shovel sunshine you know it's uh it's uh it's just great i mean we're really spoiled i mean there's a lot of things we miss about New England you know uh uh where there's no trees to speak of and the big you know thick trees we used to have in New England and we used to enjoy it we had a we had two acres of land attached to our house course we only had a thousand sq uare foot house but we had two acres of land and um oh my goodness and so we that now we have this we have a house that's three times as big but we have less than a quarter acre lot you know and uh and uh sure once you're out of the house you're in the street that's right and uh so we kind of it's it's we've gone from one extreme to the other and that's that's been hard to adjust to but uh the weather we can't oh the weather's been wonderful that's good i did go up to New England one time during their fall season when the weather was just oh yeah yeah you know it was kind of a a brisk feeling outside but it wasn't freezing the leaves were turning and now that part of a winter up there i could truly love but uh yeah yeah oh i can remember uh walking around you know taking a lunch break uh you know when the air's real brisk and the the colors on the trees are just so vivid um oh it was just that that's something i miss i i keep i'm i get homesick thinking about it you know uh-oh well what about your summers in Dallas now is that similar was it humid up in the New England states like it is down there oh yeah humid very humid in New England i mean you got hundred degree weather i mean in in in like in the Boston area i Boston's right on the water yeah and uh you'd have these hundred degree days where the humidity was just one hundred percent and it was stifling uh here you in in Dallas in the Dallas area the humidity you get some humid days but it's not nearly as bad you get you get a lot of dry days too well so that's really no big tell i tell you what that's funny to hear you talk about that because for me to come to Dallas in the summer is stifling humidity to me because Lubbock is so dry uh you know it may be a hundred and a hundred and five or whatever up here but there is no humidity and it's is it is it okay yeah okay you know if there's a breeze blowing it's a nice comfortable day and you don't feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you you take a shower and walk outside and the humidity's so great you know you're sweating to death again oh yeah yeah everything's relative i guess yeah because i grew up on the east coast yeah oh and uh i'm originally from Virginia and uh and my memories of summer have always been that stifling humidity yeah and compared to the humidity here you know in fact uh whenever i think about moving you know whenever we talk maybe about moving back to the east coast the thing that comes back to me is that sensation of those stifling summers which which i don't experience here all right i play volleyball and softball and ceramics ceramics sounds interesting uh i do computer programming kind of as a hobby on the side and i also like to uh do gardening and also like to workout i didn't think of working out as a hobby yeah or playing with the computer i do both at home yeah yeah well i i uh i work with computers at work and then i come home and do and i have uh a little lap top at home that i just like to play with uh we've gotten a little Atari computer uh husband describes it as a a computer with training wheels uh yeah well pottery sounds interesting have you made a lot of uh a lot of vases and things or no i i do ceramics i i you know the pieces are made from a mold and i paint them what kind of oh uh you know you get them you clean them up you know get the uh mold line off um-hum you know you scrape that off and uh make it as smooth as possible uh then you uh put it in a kiln and fire it you know it's like a big ogen oven um-hum and uh when you pull it out it's called bisque uh it started it off with greenware when you first start off and then it goes to bisque and that's when you can paint it huh do you have your own kiln or do you do you no i've uh you you can rent people's kiln they they uh you take your pieces to their house or their ceramic shop and uh pay them there's one woman that charge ten dollars a month for fire all that i wanted oh oh well that that doesn't sound like it's too expensive a hobby does uh does the uh clay and and the paints and things are they expensive the paints and stuff can get expensive the greenware it depends on what you buy now i bought a a chess set for my husband and painted it for him and i'd say the greenware for you know twenty four pieces i think is what they're no no thirty two pieces is a was cost cost me about eight dollars um-hum well that doesn't sound very expensive to me no i liked it i had fun with it but uh you know uh i'm a little shaky when it comes to detail work so i couldn't get the fine pieces so you know i had to um-hum get parts that had big spaces in them yeah uh couldn't do the fine detailed fine detail on it hum but uh you know i made my son his uh Donald Duck and you know the Disney characters painted them for him in real bright colors uh-huh and uh he enjoyed them till he was about two and then he uh had fun throwing them and broke them hm oh no well and that was during one of my softball games and my husband had him and he just kept giving them to him and letting him breaking them well children will tend to do that yeah well i didn't get mad at the kid i got mad at my husband for giving them to him oh well i i i enjoy working out when i i get home from work just to just to have something to do that that i know isn't going to that's that's good for me something to do other than i workout with that uh ESPN excuse me the people on ESPN uh-huh i workout with them or try to occasionally i'll record one of the shows that's on in the morning while i'm at work and i'll do them when i get home yeah well i don't work hm yeah well i i really so i do it in the mornings i enjoy doing that i haven't worked out in quite awhile i play volleyball i guess that's good enough workout that is that can be a a workout uh big workout do you play volleyball a lot yeah it's fun at once a week uh sometimes sometimes we play two night games a night you know consist of uh fifteen point game and you play two games and you know the best uh person that wins two games wins hm and uh few times we've had a tie breaker so i played three games and uh yeah then we'll get a half hour break or so and then i'll go and play another set with somebody else you know yeah it's fun hm yeah i i enjoy volleyball i'm just not very good at it and i end up just killing my knees yeah well uh i've torn mine up uh you know uh we play with a church team so we're not competitive we're just having fun huh uh-huh and uh when i played softball it was with the church team it was just for fun although the church team we made it to the nationals we were ranked fifteenth in the nation so i you know i'm proud of that wow yeah but that was a for another you know i was in another state then oh so i'm not with the same softball team but they're starting up soon so i'll be playing again yeah i have several friends that play softball they play softball in different church leagues it's around town it's a good way to get out with people and you don't have to uh uh let's see what's the word they have fun without doing the drinking and all that yeah yeah and uh you know you don't hear a lot of angry words i'll you know be nice and uh you know it's going out to have fun uh-huh yeah because it you know it's a it's a hobby you do not want to be stressed out after playing no kidding hobbies are supposed to be enjoyable they're not supposed to be difficult or or they're not supposed to make you less relaxed than when you began um-hum yeah well uh get back to compooter computer programming of yours uh uh-huh i've been uh trying to program some uh disk or some uh what do you call them putting some programs into the on the disk and uh i'll get to about fifteen sixteen lines and i'd mess up and it just says you have entered a error in line and i don't see how people do that that drives me batty uh-huh well i i have a a Computer Information Systems degree from school and i've been at it awhile so you know you just kind of learn the tricks of the trade and yeah and move on the closest i come to uh having a uh program work on me was the the Atari toot toot and you know that was just a couple lines and you push a button and you hear a train and then the the the toot toot hum the kids like it though they think it's a hilarious yeah yeah well i need to run i enjoyed talking to you uh all right thank you bye-bye sure bye-bye well i haven't uh i've been working in my own home for just um about the last three years but so i can just wear whatever i want around the house but before then i taught taught at the University of Houston and um oh now that's nice yeah so i tried to wear things that were comfortable but still tried to look you know somewhat business attire yeah yes but it wasn't quite business but to give the the students um an made you feel like you were the authority i felt like if i came in just in jeans or tattered clothes that i didn't have as good control over the class right right and if i tried to wear things that were a little bit more businesslike exactly well i i work uh i'm a financial analyst and uh uh um-hum in my group uh nearly everyone wears a a sports coat and tie uh but that does change in the summer uh they they get a little more lenient and we can wear like uh an open collar or uh uh-huh a lot of times in the summer i'll try to uh like on a Friday i'll try to take off half a day and maybe go play some golf oh that's nice so uh i'll try to wear a short sleeve shirt and uh um and that that's okay that's appropriate well do you um meet with clients and so you have to dress a certain way for the clients or not really it's uh it's just uh in our small group we uh we have a controller and uh we support a senior vice president and uh the senior vice president is uh um-hum is big on business attire and so um um he sort of funnels that down to uh to the people that work in his group so um i i i enjoy it i think it uh it makes a nice environment and uh i don't know gives it a little more business type uh atmosphere well i uh i have noticed with my own children for example that they will depending on what they're wearing it it makes a big difference on how they act and so that could be the same can be said for the business office too right see i think that's exactly right you know if if you're uh if you're dressed in a uh a suit and uh to me it make it helps me feel uh sort of like you were saying a lot more confident in myself um-hum um-hum and uh if i do have to approach the uh the controller or the vice president i feel i just have that little little extra confidence in myself being dressed that way well and i noticed in my uh teaching experience that since a lot of the people were my own age or older even um that because i taught English as a second language so i didn't have your average freshman student and um so i oh i see i had to do something to just elevate myself a little bit off their level i mean you want to be friends with the students but you don't quite want to be their equal exactly and so for me to dress in uh in businesslike um clothes my you know i i preferred slacks because we had to walk park pretty far away from oh Lord and down in Houston it'd be so hot yeah yes and you wouldn't want to have to walk uh you know in high heels it's hard to walk a long way and the campus is pretty large right i see so i preferred slacks and um you know kind of dressy shirts and things but right so that i would look a little bit different and i would come in and i would have just the appearance of a little bit more authority than they did and that helped with their discipline and right i see didn't make me have um to much trouble and right right with the students and i think clothing you know it it just uh it it does like you were saying the the way you dress makes you feel different ways um if you like when you go out at night uh you may just want to have a casual evening or something so you you sort of dress down but if you're going to a uh um-hum a social type party then you dress up and that i think it just has a a change on your attitude well and i i noticed since we moved down here to Texas my husband is originally from Texas but uh i'm not and that you don't have to have uh such a wide variety of seasonal clothes that you do up north where you have to i see i'm i'm sure that's true yeah totally different wardrobe with different fabrics you know heavier wools and right yeah see the winter season's just not that long to to invest a whole lot of money in in uh and in the the heavier heavier materials no and you don't um you know if you usually can wear pretty close to the same types of things just with a jacket or sweater right or something rather than having the whole entire different wardrobe with exactly exactly different shoes you know we always had like um higher higher shoes higher tops on them rather than just um the lower right skimmers skimmers i think they call them that you would wear day-to-day but and see i think ladies clothing um uh is a lot more varied than than than men's clothing because uh men or at least in my situation you can uh i can wear the same slacks and uh sports coats nearly nearly all year round um-hum and uh ladies you know uh uh i don't know if that's marketing or what but they they definitely have a uh i think a a winter type wardrobe and then a spring and then a summer that's really true a lot of it is um the color certain colors seem to be more acceptable true you know if you wear um pastels it's needs to be warm weather right and otherwise you have to wear darker colors in the winter for some reason and i guess part of that is um just the physics of it that in what isn't it dark colors attract the sun and light colors repel repel them so right exactly plus the social attitude you know if if you walk into a place and and uh i know in our office uh our secretary gives everyone a hard all the ladies a hard time if they wear white shoes i think it's uh is it after uh Labor Day or something i don't know and and uh so you know the the social attitude has a little bit to do with uh i think the way we dress um-hum that's true there's some rule that's like between Labor Day uh no is it Labor Day or Memorial Day i'm not for sure it's that one in September is when you need to quit uh-huh right and the one that's like in May you can only wear and and supposedly we don't have an opportunity my husband and i we don't go to a lot of like where you have to wear yeah right a white dinner jacket or something and so you can only wear a white dinner jacket between those two i see right exactly exactly holidays too that's pretty funny it's funny that we have as a society go to so much trouble when we have so many other things we could be spending our time thinking about exactly a lot more uh th at's right a lot more helpful ideas that we could be uh spending time and effort on rather than our appearance um-hum yes i noticed uh when we moved to Plano that um the mall here Collin Creek Mall i don't know where you are but um right i live here in Plano yeah oh you do that there there is a pretty um i wouldn't say snobbish but it it's kind of borders on that that if i depending on what i'm wearing i get better service at the mall i felt since oh really huh uh where you know from where i've lived in Houston that you have to in order to get yeah the attention you might need help right you need to be you can't just come in off the street is what i'm trying to say exactly and i think that's you know a North Dallas type attitude oh is it and uh because i noticed that uh like even going to church uh seems like people really dress up a lot more uh here in North Dallas going to church um-hum and uh i don't know that's that's uh because i i went to school with at uh Texas Tech in Lubbock um-hum and uh church was a a lot more casual uh rather than uh you know here it's like going to a fashion show almost yes i think i think your right i've noticed that too it's just it's very different but i've i think um it's kind of sad when you have to go in and make dress up to go somewhere i mean just to the shop right to try to keep up with the Jones almost yeah yeah and you have to be sure that your everything coordinates and everything everything is um freshly pressed and everything right you can't just wear your sweats and an old T-shirt and no you can't just drop in well i appreciate um the conversation we've had about clothing i know i've it's interesting to hear a man's point of view it's usually my husband right he's got a pretty good deal i go out and buy all his clothes and they magically well now that is that is so uh well that is great i appreciate the call well thank you and you have a good day okay bye-bye you too bye-bye all right um i think the topic was crime in the city right i do not live in a city i live in a real small little place where is that uh it's about thirty miles from Sherman north south east or west it's north of Sherman well you live almost in Oklahoma uh it not too far yeah that's kind of ironic because i don't live too far from Oklahoma either huh you know where Saint Joe is uh i've been through there i'm about eight miles south of it okay oh yeah i had been through Saint Joe but um just as far as you know watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad well you know i've i've seen those statistics and everything and you know what frightens me is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert um-hum with high tech weaponry you know i mean the Iraqis didn't have a lot of high-tech weaponry but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that oh yeah sure and they didn't kill as many people in in forty five days and they were intending to kill people i mean that was their job uh-huh as they killed in Washington DC oh i know i know i know um people i think nowadays people just really just murder is nothing to them you know well i formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years i guess and i've come to the conclusion and this is a pretty scary thought to me even that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime rather than put them in prison because prison's proven not to work just let them go say okay you're convicted uh-huh and just let them go yeah and if they get convicted again well just kill them um-hum yeah because uh most likely that will happen won't it that you know well i think that the best hope to eliminate crime as we know it today um-hum is to eliminate the criminals from society uh-huh if someone is known to have been in prison they can't get a job no you know they can't be accepted into society yeah you know if they're not going to be accepted into society then everybody's going to become sociopathic um-hum and you know who's to put the limit on it i mean i was watching a thing last night up in Washington State if you get convicted of uh sexual offenses on a regular basis i mean some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions uh-huh and they're still let out on the street after one or two years well in Washington State if you're a habitual sexual offender they just don't let you out hum uh you serve your prison term and then you go into the mental hospital and if you're pronounced cured they'll let you go uh-huh well they may find a cure for it but there is no known cure now hum so you're you're kind of thinking in other words if you get if you do something the first time that's not real bad you know hey people make mistakes yeah to go ahead and let them go but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then uh well yeah use that or you know there's other consequences rather than killing them you know you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against oh um-hum um-hum you know at least they might be some benefit in that and if the people they committed a crime against yeah feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are are okay you know well they can free them uh-huh but uh you know with the technology technology we have today you can put a collar on a guys leg that will knock him down if they leave the property i mean it will just in incapacitate them uh-huh and you can put a collar around a guys leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of you know prohibitive act uh-huh but you know putting them in prison my God that doesn't work no apparently not because look how many years they've been doing that and look i mean yeah well you look at places like Turkey Turkey has death penalty for just about everything um-hum uh-huh i mean if you get convicted of uh you know drug trafficking they just kill you you get convicted of uh you know uh heinous crimes they just kill you i mean there's no two ways about it uh-huh and uh you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few you know and you look at our society almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times three or four times yeah right i mean you know that is true i know you know the way to stop that kind of behavior is this two fold one you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven i i think that's very important oh i'm i agree very much so on that i yeah and then if a parent has proved to be unfit for any reason um-hum take t he kids away from the parents yeah because you know we are what we teach um-hum because that's what our society becomes i mean we have a just a bunch of people comes yeah and i've and i've i've lived in that that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work you know and these guys they come to work every morning and they're stoned to the bone i mean their so high they could fly up to the top of that building and they work all day and they go home and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money and then they go back to work on Monday um-hum and the kids of these people sure they just think that's the normal thing to do don't they are phenomenally they're sociopathic yeah yeah and i worked in a first grade uh classroom for one full semester um-hum and these kids were more foul mouthed than i've ever been i had one kid threaten my life first grader in the first grade threaten my life told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death oh no you know and they flipping me the finger and all that um-hum and i just said to this kid i said you got two choices kid you can step into mainstream society or you can die uh-huh because you will eventually be killed and you know i just i'm just totally aghast aghast at a what's going on oh i know i know um i work in school you know that's huh-uh something i do and i it really is i'm like you astonishing what the younger ages know and they react to what they see at home You know if they see violence at home that's what you're going to get from the kids at school you know it really is exactly and that's kind of sad well you can see it in the work place you know used to be when you had a personality conflict you just you worked with it and you got through it uh-huh now you know people get fired or what's even worse is they promote them into a position that they can't handle and let them get fired yeah or one thing or the other you look at another kind of society like the Japanese you put that many people on that small of a space they've learned to live together okay it's in their culture um-hum and one of the things that's in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while Japan was becoming a great power financially the people that worked for those companies worked for the same company they worked for at sixty five as they did when they were eighteen teen and the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people if they weren't fit for the job they were hired for they didn't just can them they made a position for them some where huh uh-huh uh you look at uh Frito Lay my wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist you know transcribing stuff into the computer uh-huh well she can type about one hundred and five words per minute but she don't like it she she just doesn't like to do that i mean she will cause yeah but you know her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is um what kind of hobbies do you have um i do a lot of cross-stitching and painting when i do have spare time oh i love it really i like cross-stitch too i just have a hard time finding any spare time lately i'm that's my case also i've got a new born and and there's just no time uh-huh have have you been cross-stitching long oh several years my husband is even interested in it now he likes to help me design um you know projects that are a little more customized oh really mine sort of he looks at the pattern and he says how do you get that from there to the to the material not that hard i really i really enjoy it but oh its not and once uh once you get started on it it's just oh i just i love it i do a lot of my own patterns also um-hum yeah in fact i did one uh Bill the Cat you know from Glenn County oh yeah that uh was a real good one to do it was it was tough but uh yeah do you have any others or is it just mainly cross-stitch um i do mostly that um not very artistic really for like painting and stuff oh uh-huh um but now i don't know yeah uh but i well i'm still trying to get all the DMC colors oh really yeah i've got the kits to to put them all in i don't have them all yet uh right yeah uh got to counting the other day and uh i think i have what was it two hundred and i got to thinking the money that i've got invested in this certainly is uh it uh yeah it can add up quick oh yeah i just i just keep an inventory of what i currently have and then when i start a a new project i go through and see if i if i you know just buy the colors that i need of what i'm low on um-hum right i see well now can i improvise with adding using another color color instead you know what comes close um-hum because a lot of them are are similar yeah a lot of times you can do that think the i think the pinks there's like forty two different shades of pink good grief yeah there's there's lots of pinks and greens pinks and greens yeah there's lots of shades of greens um-hum but the colors are i just love all the different colors yeah they had they had quite a few new ones come out last year that they added to but but you don't have much spare time either well not lately i even started a new job and trying to get acclimated there oh yes and that does take sometime yes we're trying to get acclimated with the uh with having a baby and there's just he's seven months old yeah how old oh yeah and just into everything so there's not a spare moment oh but i wouldn't trade it for the world i've been trying to do some bibs for him oh yeah and uh and and work on his Christmas stocking yeah we missed it the the last year so hopefully this year he'll have one yeah well last year he was a little bit young for having one uh right right probably wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway he oh he liked right if it tasted good yeah uh you would have but uh yeah all he liked was the lights this year so oh yeah oh well that's neat that uh you like cross-stitch also yeah that's that's kind of strange that we got the same call yeah uh uh it to which oh oh i'm sorry go ahead no that's okay okay uh but yeah i've been doing it for probably about ten years or so oh wow no i just started about well five years ago i think but but it is peaceful i mean it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it um-hum there's bit off a couple of large projects baby afghans and got one done and i think the other one's gonna the child is gonna be in high school before i get finished oh on that uh is it one of those uh afghans that i've seen in the packages or the the squares large squares embarrassing well yeah i just i bought the cloth and the the pattern for it i didn't um i didn't buy the uh i didn't buy a kit oh uh-huh well i've seen the afghans in the in the stores that uh are designed for cross-stitch uh-huh it's it's that cloth it's called Anne Cloth i think and it has the borders and everything already oh okay um-hum yeah those are pretty number one turned out just great and the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that i had done it in the colors that they had decorated the uh the nursery and i didn't even know it oh that's a coincidence she i gave it to her and she said how did you know those are the colors we used i said didn't that was a good coincidence just worked out that way that's great um that uh now i've got some material to do an afghan but i just never did get around to finishing it um-hum i like those those are pretty yeah Lilly yeah Lilly she she said i said it's for it's for your daughter to use oh no she said i know she doesn't get to touch it she hung it on the wall yes my uh grandmother uh made us a couple of quilts for the baby and i was like oh i don't want to mess those up um-hum yeah oh there just too nice i mean you don't get many hand made quilts anymore yeah oh yeah um true well i've enjoyed this okay uh but uh wel l keep up the good um well keep up the cross-stitching you too all righty bye bye all right thanks bye bye hi Gary hi today is uh Saturday have you found spare time to do any hobbies hello uh yeah as a matter of fact i went to uh one of the nurseries and uh bought myself another cactus plant i've got many uh shrubs inside the house is that right inside your house like cactus gardens and the like inside yeah um-hum uh yeah in the south south window in the bathroom i've got uh quite a few that's nice and uh along with all the other uh uh plants i've got in the house a lot of different types we do the same kind of things though we've been concentrating on outside lately trying to do some gardening and uh planting a lot of trees and flowers yeah i'm i'm assessing the damage outside right now i've got couple of a few shrubs i need to replace outside from the winter yeah they didn't uh survive the freeze yeah we have a couple of those too we uh we haven't planted a garden yet we moved to moved here from Colorado not too long ago where we had a really big garden but here i i know i hear i hear that the uh growing is a little bit different have you had a garden uh yeah well i've got uh oh several uh shrubs outside uh out there depending on um-hum have you ever tried new vegetables yeah no i never have uh no vegetable gardens uh used to have that when i lived with my folks up in Wisconsin they always grew a lot of vegetables i thought we had yeah we just but no vegetables here a lot of evergreens it gets so hot i just wonder you know what what vegetables can really take that heat we'll see well there's there's quite a few that can handle that uh any local nursery will be able to help you with with something like that that's true um besides uh gardening what other uh types of things are you interested in well i do some oh some needle crafts things hobbies sometimes some cross stitch um no no sewing or knitting any of that um we'll see some cross stitch you know some gifts that i make for friends and families that kind of thing okay anything else you you do in your spare time oh yeah well i play softball a couple of times a year it's they're getting ready to start up the the season again yeah i have two small children so i started to you know have them enrolled like in soccer and things like that i tend to be more of a spectator these days than participating oh the day like today it's so nice outside you like to get out there and do something uh yeah it's beautiful need to break out the bicycle too get that down and start to ride around mine's got a flat tire so i'm gonna have to do something about that uh-huh well i don't uh have too much else i do in my spare time how about you well um i'm not uh much of a a woodworker myself but my dad owns a shop and he uh makes quite a few uh arts and crafts just type things out of wood and um is that right did he sell them at craft shows and yeah they go to arts and crafts fairs and uh have their uh stand that they set up display all their uh all their products lots of vases and plates and bowls um-hum well that's neat um-hum things of that nature i'm probably the best customer i've got the house stocked with uh lot of their stuff is it pottery or is it wood no it's it's wood turning oh that's beautiful and he's got a got a lathe and all kinds he's got a shop full of equipment and they uh he turns turns out bowls and vases um-hum of uh all different types of exotic woods oh that sounds neat how about like big salad bowls those kind of things uh yeah yeah some some like that uh uh lots of uh different types of vases uh ones that stand on the floor and others that you can put on tables and uh he's been doing a lot of uh lot of decorative type plates lately um-hum boy they sound nice well i don't think i've ever seen wooden plates at any of the craft shows okay uh well there are shops around here that have uh items like that uh not too many with the style that he uses though so um-hum that sounds like a unique item yeah they're they're uh quite unique and uh it's well he's retired so it it's something to do in the spare time they've got a lot of time to to work on that now uh-huh well that's good keeps them active i'm sure well it was good talking to you uh-huh okay is that uh that's alrighty good luck with your indoor gardening there all right i'll talk to you later um-hum bye-bye appreciate it thanks bye all right do you have any kids okay no i've got two and it is hard to find day care for them what um what do you think needs to be the criteria set for those oh what would you like to see in one well i i've seen the bad side in most of them uh-huh i took my son to a day care one time when he was just you know just uh not even three months old and uh you know it was a desperate thing and uh when my husband went to pick him up she he said that the baby had been crying the whole time he was asleep but you know how they cry in their sleep yeah and uh you know this uh couldn't catch his breath even in his sleep and that turned me off of day cares i bet and then when i took uh i've seen these kids that uh it's a church volleyball they have a day care set up there for people playing volleyball and uh one of the girls was real mean to the kid uh-huh hm and that was you know he she'd just she had treated him like family does you know and um yeah it you know it uh i know most of the girls up there and the ones that keeps my kids are real good uh my son doesn't like people too much yeah but uh when when we leave there he uh gives the girl a hug and tells her i'll miss you so you know oh well that's good so i know they treat him good yeah uh is it i don't know maybe would you think a better student to teacher ratio do they have too many kids in most day cares for the people they have yeah yeah uh i don't know much about day cares itself you know uh you know this is more of just the nursery for three and under um-hum and uh there's only there's two people taking care of about five kids uh where i'm where i'm taking my two uh-huh and but uh in most places yeah they got forty five kids at best i guess oh my goodness you know and maybe about four teachers and that's a lot of kids yeah um we don't yeah we don't have any but we have you know plenty of sisters and brothers that that have them and uh i'm not sure that there is a solution to that as far as uh the day there you know everybody has in their mind the kind of day care that they want but it seems you know that there's not really the perfect one out there no there's not nobody can take care of your kids better than you right and that's not even possible anymore i don't think to be able to take care of your own kids without you know with everybody working these days well i had to quit my job because of uh my my two you know uh day care wise or babysittingwise and stuff uh because you know my sister was keeping them uh uh we just lucked out and she uh met a military man who lived down here and we came down here for TI uh-huh and uh so i had her baby sitting but she was six months pregnant and it was getting too much for her so i just quit i'd rather quit and take care of my own kids than let somebody else raise them oh yeah yeah that seems probably the best way to do it well you know they're getting raised right yeah yeah um i haven't really the only day cares that i have been familiar with are the ones that are local here with the churches and they seem to from my experience be the best at what they're doing just because of what they're based on yeah yeah if um i i know one church that uh there was some problems with but that was just uh basically a personal problem between the mother and the uh person that was taking in charge oh but uh the church uh day care that my kids uh they don't go to a day care you know it's uh during Sunday School and stuff uh the people there are really nice uh-huh yeah yeah i think i think that's that's important yeah well they i think it's one of the important things um-hum if uh because if they don't like it uh you can't get them that separation thing and i need that my kids i need to cut the strings on them they're not very old but yeah how old are they three and uh four and two oh so you know they're they're good kids you know they do bad things but they're good kids um-hum but you know kids kids do those yeah uh but i don't like the punishment the day care does you know i don't know exactly what they do but i don't want no one punishing my kids but myself uh-huh right and that's another problem with day care because you're not there so you don't what they're doing right right and if yeah they're probably i would think needs to be i don't know if they have any type of uh formal or informal spontaneous or routine drop ins of agencies you know people checking up on like they do nursing homes you know they drop in to see if you're meeting all of the requirements by law and and i think they need to do that with day cares and just see what's going on yeah that's that's that's something that should be brought up with these people so but i'm not really sure i don't know if they do it either to be truthful yeah i don't either it's not until you have kids i guess you worry about those things well uh with me i just decided not to face it and you know in most in in so many words you know in one way or the other i just decided not to face that issue and i just keep them with me yeah uh-huh well i don't know what we've done to solve any of this but i've enjoyed talking with you yeah so have i oh and welcome to Texas oh well thanks and i guess i we've we've been on long enough so you have a good day all right bye-bye thank you bye-bye okay did it click okay um well how do you feel about food and cooking yes oh i love food and i love to cook i really love to cook i'm not a really gourmet cook i'm just a normal everyday cook what about you um-hum well we're vegetarians and we just became vegetarians for i i just became a vegetarian over the past uh year and a half and it's a real challenge to find foods proper foods to eat and it's a real challenge not to become like what they call a junk food junkie where your menu is composed of uh things that you want to eat that aren't vegetable you know that aren't don't contain meat products or don't contain animal products but maybe aren't you know uh balanced meal so to speak so but we we feel a lot better since we've become vegetarians don't you do you miss meat at all i did at first but um not really no not i i can't imagine eating meat um the reason i tranged uh changed to become a vegetarian was for ethical reasons so the idea of me eating meet would be like eating something you know i i think of it as something alive you know so it i can't do it you know for for me it's it just um-hum but i do sometimes when i smell meat you know when i smell particularly uh say steak or something you know that i i do admit that i you know still wish you know that i could have that flavor but but i know what it i know what it is so i you know i don't want it but so when if you have if you have people over would you fix all vegetables or you know when you cook for company do you fix just all vegetables yeah you you'd be surprised the things i mean you could like tonight we're having um nature burgers which are like a grain burger and you can it's really pretty good i i the people i serve it to like my sister and family members well my family members are vegetarians now basically i mean they're not they're not when they go out to eat they sometimes eat other meat you know meats and things but at home we eat vegetarian meals and uh you can make you know make uh pasta meals and different things that people are use to eating that wouldn't offend you know that they wouldn't be offended that there wasn't a meat there yeah you know at the at the table or even pizzas you can make a pizza that's not that doesn't have any animal product animal you know you would have animal products it would have cheese but you know not meat yes but that's do you eat cheese do you eat like eggs an yeah we do eat i i had become for about three or four months i was a vegan which is a person that eats um no animal products no cheeses no eggs and that's even more difficult it's really hard to find the products and it's hard that's even harder to keep yourself from eating because it it adds so much to meals you know when you put cheese on something or yeah you know it really makes a difference yeah and eggs yeah eggs my mother just said eggs it's hard to find substitutes for eggs when you're baking and cooking and things yeah so although you can i mean there's cookbooks and there's ways to do it it's a lot more expensive too i think you know the the the market is just not made for a vegan so but um but it's becoming more that way i think it's probably easier now to find things yeah it if well it really is because today just today we were in the grocery store and they had lentils and i you know i wasn't really sure whether they would have lentils in the grocery store we've been living in Bermuda and in Bermuda they had a um a health food store that really had a lot of good stuff and where we're living now is a small town that really doesn't you know just having that kind health food store that caters to those kind of needs and you just have to hope that the grocery store will you know the bigger grocery stores yeah and they actually had lentils which some stores don't have things like that you know which i don't think i even know what a lentil is yeah see that lot of people don't and that's i've heard i've heard of a lentil yeah like lentil soup or something people don't and that's such a good source of protein or like soybeans you know people think ugh they think it's something really uh-huh um-hum horrible but there's a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to begin with that you don't even know where in there so um it's it's just a matter of learning you know you had to learn i was going to say you have to learn a whole new way to cook yeah so but it oh no way but i bet it's really i bet it is healthy because a couple of times last week i went without meat um i had pasta and salad for two days just because i just want you know oh no particular reason i just didn't feel like eating meat and uh i think even after two days i felt different um-hum yeah well think of it as think of it like this takes a long time for meat to digest and you know if you've got that sitting in your stomach i mean even when you sleep it's still sitting there digesting so you you kind of giving your stomach a chance to relax a bit and not have to work so hard to digest all that meat yeah you know because it takes longer than some products some other foods in your stomach to digest that meat yeah so so when you prepare a meal like say on Thanksgiving what do you um you prepare a lot of vegetables and there's lots of different casseroles and things so you just make you just yeah everything but the turkey no yeah you just you just well see at ours uh we're living with my family my folks now so you know they they have the turkey you know they do they can't they you can't stop you know everyone's life but um yeah i think if in our own house we didn't we would have things like a casserole things like that that centered more on the vegetables as far as we might have one special dish one special casserole that was our one special thing like the turkey you know with the main meal kind of thing and and i suppose because it's for me ethical we'd just play up the fact that Thanksgiving's you know is a time for everyone to give thanks even turkey you know yeah even the turkey yeah that's true so um but it it's interesting finding different recipes although my mother is the one that cooks um which well do they have special cookbooks out for for just vegetarian meal meals you know special books that you yeah yeah lots of them lots of them and uh i have this one in front of me right now as a matter of fact it's called Sundays at the Moosewood Restaurant and uh it's out of New York it's a pretty famous restaurant out of New York and almost every single recipe in there is um vegetarian there are some fish recipes i think in it but a few of those but not anything but you don't eat fish either do you no we don't eat fish either but it the majority of the book is um vegetarian with no meats so or you know of any any kind of animal so there's quite a few out there i have a i have a hard time with vegetables i don't i when i was a kid i didn't like them very much and i never really learned how to cook them right i guess i don't know um-hum um i'll eat a little bit of broccoli and i'll steam it and i like carrots just certain things you know but uh i'm not really good with them and i'll go sometimes and not even fix them i mean i'll have everything else and no vegetable that's strange isn't it yeah it's strange because well it it's not strange because i use to be the same way and i'm even to this day you know some vegetables really turn me off but when you read so much information that says this is a healthier way to go you know and this is what your body wants this is what your body really needs and when you think about what is what's the real reason your eating i know i know it's for taste because i'm boy am i a taste person but but really the main reason is for fuel you know and and when you read so much information that tells you that meats and different animal products you know are causing uh can cause uh different kinds of diseases you know like heart heart diseases and different diabetes and things like that different kinds of diseases it's like uh is it really worth it and the people i i really think in general people in the United States just don't eat enough vegetables you know because you can talk grain all you want as far as you know cleaning your system out so to speak but you can't beat vegetables to give you all the nutrients and vitamins and and the the the kind that you can't get from a little pill yeah because your body doesn't doesn't synthesis synthesis in the same way that it does when it gets it in raw food you know but now if you cook them wrong you can loose the vitamins to yeah that's true that's true so you it's it's all important you know it's an all important thing that you and i'm terribly overweight i'm obese probably is the word i've never used that word on myself before but i am very large and probably if i could give up the meat products and just get on vegetables i would probably look a lot better i think you'd feel probably a lot healthier um my almost almost everyone in my family is is obese yeah i i would say you know the almost everyone and uh except except me except myself and you know my husband but um and uh yeah i i i don't know that my mother and father have seen any improvements since we've been here as far as them switching to meat but do you think you fill healthier mom she my mother says she feels healthier okay uh the topic is to discuss the uh sources where i receive news uh-huh and uh for me that's uh mostly newspaper and radio i almost never watch television as a matter of course so i don't get news from television except during the war i watched a lot of CNN because it was so good uh-huh well why was CNN the only of course i think Saddam Hussein only allowed CNN to broadcast it is that not true um it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage yeah um i don't know i guess uh i don't even know why i watch CNN i guess i just wanted more news it's one of the few times i wanted yeah well i know even if you watched ABC NBC or or the other you i mean what's the other one uh CBS they all were were tapped into CNN more news than CBS were they uh-huh that's the only thing they broadcast and like you i listen to the radio on my job at work and all this week they've been having this uh yeah uh-huh a discussion about that is why uh why CNN was well i listen to a Christian radio station and they were saying that CNN is definitely a world uh news service and uh um-hum that was you can't really be sure of the quality of what you got you know hm uh we had some uh some people from our church went to Israel uh just for a uh tour sort of thing um-hum and i was watching on TV they they broadcast this terrible riot supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem so we got all fearful for our people come to find out they came back and said they weren't even aware of it right and so it really made me question as to what how do we know about you know uh if the news we're getting is any good so yeah i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably yeah don't affect ninety nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made right right but uh i can i'm from California and i can remember being in uh in these earthquakes and i mean they were they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view and it seemed yeah you know from anyone else's point of view but they'd get all blown up in the news uh-huh uh well i it i find it depressing to watch or especially TV you know it's uh local news concentrates on murders and things like that i'm from Dallas um-hum and uh we have a lot of bad stuff it just really gets me depressed even to watch it um-hum yeah so then you wake up one morning and you're in war with somebody you don't even know about it right so oh what newspaper uh do you read in Dallas uh we have the Dallas Times Herald and the Dallas Morning News but i don't i don't read newspapers don't you how come huh-uh i have find it hard to uh follow from one page to another it's just something i've never developed uh an interest in huh and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered it's stolen before i can get out and get it God that's uh that sounds pretty bad to me i mean who would steal a newspaper you'd be surprised hm they just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the TV you know uh selections of the day i don't know it just wouldn't be there whenever i've tried it i see yeah so you're right who would steal a newspaper but they do yeah what part of California are you from uh from Los Angeles but i live in Raleigh North Carolina right now that's where i'm speaking to you from oh okay but i grew up in LA i work out here huh you work for TI no i don't i work for North Carolina State University huh but uh i know some people at TI and i have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them so i'm in the computer business yeah well i boy current events is not a good subject for me well i don't keep up with it that often let's see i've i've i've never done this before i mean i've never this is your first call this is my first call because i just got my password uh-huh oh really so i don't know are we suppose to it seems to me it says you're supposed to talk for three minutes but i think we've been talking for three minutes and nobody has interrupted yeah well i'd i got into a conversation last night with a lady and they interrupt at ten minutes i see so if we've done our three minutes let's just let the conversation end and say bye nice talking to you too bye-bye uh-huh well all right nice talking to you all right bye hello hey how you doing hello not bad not bad What's your name Fernando Fernando my name is Nick wait let me turn off my stereo here sure because i've been like waiting like for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody yeah really man am i right what time is it over there are you are you in Dallas no no i'm in Detroit or not Detroit i'm in uh California are you yeah i because every time i got through i went to Dallas Texas really yeah i'm in North Carolina oh well you're on the uh lets see on the other coast yeah twenty one yeah shoot man it's what midnight almost what yeah yeah it's uh i'm watching Saturday Night Live here yeah okay all right well i guess we're supposed to talk what about credit card what wait what what did how how did you get to know about the TI thing oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this and what what are you working on a a Master's in uh information systems really i'm doing my Master's in in Computer Science and Computer Engineering yeah where at at North Carolina State University hey how do you like it out there uh i don't because uh i come from a lot a bigger city than this one and i i'm in Raleigh and yeah Raleigh Durham yeah yeah that area and it's really small all all you have is like towns built around universities like Chapel Hill uh-huh yeah so it it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway kind of quaint little towns but they don't have a whole lot there yeah where are you at uh well i'm in Monterey California right now oh okay so so i mean it's like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people and that's about it yeah two hundred fifty yeah okay it it's it's a lot bigger than Monterey is but we're just uh just south of uh San Jose and San Francisco oh okay and it's only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city so so where do you go do you go to Berkeley no no i go to the it's the Naval Postgraduate school out here oh okay because um i was looking at at the doctorate degree in Computer Science center at Berkeley um-hum and they're asking like for a um GPA of like three point seven or something like that and like they're looking like for uh GRE like ninety nine percentile and this and that and it's like uh-huh yeah well that's what they look for whether or not they get it it's hard to say yeah i know that's why that's why i didn't apply i mean it was like yeah for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety nine percentile on the on the verbal part yeah it's pretty tough it's pretty tough i mean uh let's face it you know and you know are you did the you know as far as i found it a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know it's what you do yeah you know so uh i don't lose any sleep sleep over stuff like that so are are you going to go for your doctorate probably not see i'm in the Navy yeah and uh you know unless the Navy funds it i probably won't do it until i if i do do it it will be after i get out of the Navy when do you get out oh probably be another twelve years oh okay oh you know i like what i'm doing right now but uh but what if they pay for it what if they pay for excuse me if they pay for a PhD yeah nah they won't pay for it they've i think they have maybe two people a year go get get their PhD because i know i know a couple of people here that work for um the Army um yeah they civilians or uh military i think i think they're military but i mean the guy is still in uh-huh and um he uh he works over in Maryland uh-huh um-hum and so he's doing his Master's here they gave him like a scholarship like for a year and he's doing it in like in a year and a summer yeah um-hum and so he's getting that and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that that's why you want to join yeah um-hum but uh this guy i mean you can earn a lot more money so you say i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you've get your your you know Master's um-hum they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so well a lot of times it's you know a lot of times it's not the money that keeps people that keeps people yeah you know they they like what they're doing they you know they feel good about what they're doing that type of thing it's more but i mean i mean you the once you get your Master's you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty seven forty five thousand a year um-hum and oh easily i'm sure and that's not what they're paying no well it depends on what rank you are of course yeah yeah i know well i mean like i say if you're if you're you know if you're at an upper level in the rank category you know you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year yeah but that's uh yeah those are few and far between though yeah it's like uh in IBM in IBM you can get certain points um-hum and uh everyone's a manager but nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money ye ah i imagine it's really competitive you know it's like no i i mean IBM is like there's a joke about IBM which says you know it's like uh all all the major companies get into a a boating race right um-hum and so IBM says well we have to we have to have a team right and then they come in last and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it uh-huh yeah saying he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right so he goes have you come up with a solution uh have you come up with a solution they go yeah change the rower you know it's like everyone's a manager but you know it's like only use like one person does the work so yeah too many chiefs and not enough Indians yeah so yeah oh that can be that that can really slow you down yeah that well that's the way it works i mean that's that's why they're having problems i mean everyone's a manager and yeah i didn't realize that yeah i mean it's like it's like the people that actually do the work there um-hum are uh very few and then the other people just plan it you know it's like it's like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank yeah push paper around uh-huh you know like all these people are just standing sitting sitting sitting around just going you know like what shall we do has anybody thought of anything no And then this guy from Federal Federal Express comes along they go what's that this track which it's going around the world and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time um-hum and so it's like the same thing with IBM you know so they have this think tank and they got to come up with ideas but see uh the the thing is that IBM is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff yeah oh yeah they've got a they've got basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market yeah and a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide you know people generally go with that because they figure that the you you you probably won't get fired for getting IBM material where's if you try something different and it fails and you're dead they'll they'll say yeah why didn't you buy why didn't you try something more mainline yeah well IBM doesn't fire anybody because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job no um-hum which you you actually are like sitting around not doing anything so you quit uh i mean that's their policy they never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally illegal illegal or something like that yeah yeah like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that but they won't let you off what they'll do is like uh-huh suppose you know like you're a manager so they'll put you into uh-huh keeping up the paper you know it's like how much paper is going in um-hum and then you say that's not my job so you quit so in other words that's the way they force people out right that's why they can say you know there's no layoff policy right but it doesn't they don't really say that you know you're you're always going to have great career conditions right yeah hey that's kind of sad no but i mean it's like it's like they they have like this different policy i don't know my dad works for them but it's like IBM like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know it's like no they won't say well they're the standard right now or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of IBM a lot of times and the main yeah because see what happens is they have a good backup policy and anybody can fix it and so that's what you're gonna go for um-hum yeah well you know that's that's a that's a big thing and and you know it's like for example like Leading Edge have you ever heard of Leading Edge yeah they are out of Korea right what leading edge don't they they they made like uh small personal computers yeah small PCs aren't they're out of Korea right i don't know i i don't know but what they do is what they did i don't know is buy all the parts that IBM would throw away and build an IBM PC with all the parts that IBM would throw away yeah uh-huh oh yeah yeah because so is it like for example you test a chip it can't last seven years but it can last five IBM says let's throw it away Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you okay and so that's i mean they're still around i think yeah i've seen well i've seen them around anyway you know so that's what that's what they do they buy all all the things that IBM throws away and they that's why they're so compatible um-hum because i mean and by the time you have computer for five years you're going to throw it away anyway most people do or they have to anyway you know well i mean there's like when when you realize teachers one of my teachers got this computer and it was like voice synthesis and stuff um-hum and he got that he said you know it's like um i was testing it and it was wonderful and then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory and i want more you know and it's like wow Jesus Christ you know it's like why do you want more because it's like one second of recording i mean you put into a Wave and you want to correct the errors into Wave um-hum it takes so much i mean it's like of course it does i mean by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model and you put it in there and you want to correct those and then you know you're trying to make the the Wave smooth so you can approximately of course it's going to take a lot um-hum imagine imagine what it is for us to make mark off models you know it's like Jesus Christ that's amazing yeah well when you get yeah when you get right down to it the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory they're gonna require yeah yeah yeah both both in terms in RAM as well as uh you know standard memory or disk memory disk base yeah well like they say like nobody can get enough you know it's like so once you have something and it's like i was watching this program on TV yesterday in nineteen seventy six NASA came up with Three D graphics right well yeah you find out more yeah uh-huh and they were showing this like Three D graphics Three D graphics view of like like those hologram deals what no no no no this is like this is like video game stuff okay but the only thing was that it was just lines okay like if you like a hologram with just graphics on a on a okay well what do do you think in terms of uh benefits well personally you know i think you know of course i'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package and i think that uh we've probably got one of the best around you know besides they tend to offer adequate adequate vacation i guess and the paid time off is wonderful and uh one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered and i think that is just a a fabulous one so i don't know if you participate in that or not but absolutely isn't it great it's just a it's just a miracle that how fast that adds up you know well i have to agree with that you know i was thinking about um importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while i was waiting for uh the system to find a a respondent uh-huh uh-huh and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and i suspect that that's probably true for everyone yeah when i was much younger it was uh less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits but as i grow older and my family grows it the medical benefits are more important and the retirement is more important i had never really thought of it that way but i guess that's true i guess that's true i'm still young enough that that uh the vacation's real important to me and the paid time off is real important to me and and that kind of thing but uh you know i was just as a matter of fact i just uh celebrated my fifth year at TI the end of last month and uh kind of started looking through the the book because of that you know now that i'm a hundred percent vested you know you kind of look through the book and see well what exactly what does that mean and what is the pension all about and you know when you're when you're you know in your i'm only in my late twenties now so you tend not to think about retirement but uh it's i guess now is the time to think about it so does TI have a pretty good retirement package do you think i think they have um a one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure that they've begun the yeah uh CODA Plan it's uh-huh uh-huh certainly a a supplemental way uh and i suppose if but maybe in in your instance if if you're started with TI in your early to mid twenties and happen to stay with them until you're sixty five then you'll have a very good retirement plan right but i had another career first and then came to TI a little later uh-huh so it's not uh all by itself it won't be adequate for for my situation something to build up quite enough yeah so i have to find a way to supplement that yeah well they just they seem to make it so easy to save you know one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world but i've got money coming out to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check and it's probably not a great investment but if i wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway you know i kind of have to trade off you know if you never see it you don't spend it so and it's i understand understand though it uh believe me i do that myself and i disagree with you i don't think it's the worst investment in the world yeah do you yeah do you really not i i you know i i debate about whether it's really good or not you know well it's in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed until later yeah yeah uh it's shown a history that uh sure beats anything else yeah that's true that's very true over many many years we went uh and did a a thing through IBS which is a like a financial consultant type thing here in Dallas and uh one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was you know they work up this whole big you know proposal profile for you that every all the things that you need to work on and you need to do and then one of the things that we talked about with her was you know the need to save for our son's education we have a two year old you know and and you know we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen you know we have to do that now and and uh they have a way that they can figure you know what you know and he's two now in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college this is how much it'll cost you know and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to it's what it costs now is ridiculous what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like fifteen between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a oh you know six percent interest rate to be able to have you know money for his college and that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year so i guess it you know in that way at least we know that that's taken care of you know we we can worry about other things so i understand that approach that's what that's exactly what's happening in my family yeah yeah is it really yeah except that mine are a little bit older and and i've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there you better make sure that you've got a scholarship uh-huh that's right that's right well that's what she said to us she said now do you all want him to go to a a state college or a private college and and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college and if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship to attend you know and that was kind of our view on it it just costs too much you just can't do it you know so i don't know it's it's i don't uh it just amazing it amazes me how much the the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years i just don't know how anybody's going to do it i know and boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them um i have a an eleven year old daughter now who's saying gee dad i want to be an allergist and i said that's wonderful i applaud that let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that oh goodness yeah yeah exactly exactly and then her little brother's only two years behind and he says well i don't know i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian and i said that's great let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that that's right that's right well you know TI you know TI offers some good stuff and then i think there's i mean i think there's some negatives but there's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go i have you know all this is the first really large company i've worked for i've always been involved in little small you know individual privately owned owned firms and so i've never had the the big benefit package so i really don't know how to compare it to other big companies you know it when i came on it was great see because i had never had anything even close to what what they offered so i've been real pleased well that's fantastic and on whole on i would say that they're yeah equal to uh most of our competitors think so uh i can see some some potential changes that probably are are would not cost very much but might uh make things a little easier such as offering a a smorgasbord um-hum having a larger variety of benefits but here's the amount that that TI is going to pay for it now it's up to you it's menu selection so to speak yeah yeah and you can pick what you want and yeah right that sounds really good i read a thing i don't even remember if it was in the Da llas Site or the Inside one about uh companies allowing you and they said that TI was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days which i thought sounded like a good idea you know if you've been there you know under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not enough and you want an extra week then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay i'm going to want an extra five days this year and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck you know and they're deducting it all along so you you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time you know you're you're really not being paid for them the money is actually coming out of your own pocket but it's coming out a little bit a t a time instead of all at once you know so that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and TI said that they were looking into something like that so well i could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a a standardized compensatory time for overtime um-hum um-hum and i don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that well true true uh and and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one or or you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one um-hum uh as as a repayment for every three to five days that i work overtime there they should give me one day yeah yeah yeah but it should be a standard and and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate that's uh that's running in each department um-hum well and yeah and and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person and you know i see a lot of differences but from one group to the next you know about who gets it and who doesn't get it you know but that's and that's that way with a lot of things you know there it seems like it depends on what what group you happen to be in what what you're going to get and what you're not going to get so well that's for sure which is the same but but then it's probably that way anywhere you know that's oh i'm sure personalities always come into play uh just in this size of organization um-hum well i am new to Texas so i don't even know what the law is in the state do you um-hum well yes of course we do have capital punishment and we've you know done away with our quote fair share number oh that's right i think now that i recall reading about it in the paper yes um you know different things is it restricted to certain crimes or just yes it's certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh rape this sort of thing um-hum hum well and it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know that get into the system yes i know the one thing that i think is really sad about it as i recall from the articles that i've read is that if if people who have been there are going to be killed um there's people that come to the prisons and and they're very violent and they want i mean they're anxious for someone to be killed i just i can't see that um-hum yes that that happens on occasion it sure does maybe it just depends on you know how closely the crime you know has affected you personally you know i don't know or a person personally uh-huh no i think i would be you know i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say you know that i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty i don't know that it's a big deterrent really i don't know that it is i don't know how we'd ever find out you know really whether it is or not well there is so many chances for appeal that it keep oh yeah oh absolutely yeah it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer money yeah it's really sad i don't know i just think um yeah somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than than um expecting yes the feeling that it right with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know yes um-hum is really kind of bad and yeah it is it's it's a tough tough question it really is hum i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you know you might be by it that's true and there really are criminals that are hard-core and repeat and never never have any chance for oh absolutely that's that's right oh i don't know is it do you feel at all like it's a religious issue not with me personally it is with a lot of other people um-hum it's not not to me personally no hum no i don't know sometimes i feel i mean i do go to church and things i don't know how i would feel about it but like you say if it hit you personally closer at home you would feel feel differently um-hum yes that's a it's a tough tough question it really is do you think most states have that or yes i think most states do have capital punishment yes um-hum hum but i think the US is one of the few countries that still do that still does it that's right yes they're only i was reading something about it the other day i think there was only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still um-hum a lot of them had to have elected elected not to do so now i don't know what they do in place of it you know maybe it's life imprisonment or you know something i don't i don't know how they handle it but i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment have that well and it doesn't seem like very many people uh are really i mean there's a lot of people that are on death row but there's not very many people that actually um do get killed oh yeah yes a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else um-hum so it seems like a of people live there and through appeals because i know they do frequently i mean they cover cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper yes uh-huh yes if it finally gets to that point right the first appeal is automatic so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat yeah there's there's a lot of you know last minute uh things that happen cause a person not to have to go through the whole thing um-hum so is it uh are we doing lethal injection now yes uh-huh that's that's fairly recent i don't know how recent but fairly recent in the state of Texas before that it was uh death by electrocution um-hum which which seems so awful yes it certainly does so it's a little bit more humane i guess it is yes it would almost have to be i suppose if you if you had to chose i guess i would i am sure i would take the lethal injection yes the other one just seems so terrible yes absolutely hum it's a it's a tough question it really is i guess if i had to say you know yes or no i would say you know yes i i would have to lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison no i don't think it's a monetary thing i think we hope that it will be you know um-hum some sort of determent deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that hum some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless this may seem to be the best way out i don't know yes easiest way out maybe no i don't think it's a monetary thing hum well um and i notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area it's yes especially the murder rate its just gone crazy and it's kind of been scary to think about it and yes absolutely and you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that yes i wish i had the answer for that everybody does you hate to have the dubious honor of being you know so high in the yes it's nothing to be proud of certainly not in statistics but i you know we have been really fortunate our family hasn't had yes any crime so have we been very very fortunate and so we don't it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way that's right absolutely and how they would expect how they would um-hum hope i mean you you hear of people who have um committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again and you wonder why they can't just stop it absolutely uh-huh that's right so maybe you would yeah but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone so would i i fortunately i have never been in that circumstance i hope i never am like like everybody else no i know when um we just we moved here um i from the i got a summons jury summons just um-hum like constantly it seemed like but fortunately i had small children and i didn't have to go and it's not that i mean i think everyone should have to serve on the jury it's just that uh-huh right uh-huh i didn't i hate having to be in charge of someone else's life sure it's it's a big responsibility it really is and i would hate to have to hear any kind of case involving a violent crime or anything yes so would i that would be really awful yes absolutely well anyway i sure have enjoyed uh talking to you about this although it has been difficult but uh it is it's a tough subject it really is i'd hate to decide it but i guess um guess it's important that we decide as a people what what we're going to do right that's right anyway well you have a good day well thank you it's nice talking to you uh-huh bye bye thank you bye-bye okay the question was um what what is your opinion of youth uh spending a year or two in in public service i think it would be a great idea i'm not sure about requiring it you know of people because people are going you know feeling resentful i don't know but i think it would be a great idea yeah seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of you know what they want to be or do or you know they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time and we sure our country all countries sure need help so um-hum would uh would you be more in favor of uh you know like a local uh my only experience with it i was in Central America for a while and uh in San Salvador in El Salvador for instance everybody had what they called there social year hum um-hum oh really uh that they that they had to put in and basically it was a uh repayment for for uh high school education um-hum um and most of them joined the Red Cross and it was done internally i just there was very little external i think possibly what uh they're thinking about here more external Peace Corps type things where we're sending people off shore yeah well i think that would be real interesting for people to do but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries and hum and but i don't know if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to really you know send children you know to do that yeah i don't i don't know how the Peace Corps works i guess i was of age when the Peace Corps came in and all that i didn't know yeah i was too i thought seriously about joining at that time i thought it was a fantastic idea did you ever get any information on it like i sent off for stuff on it but i don't remember that much about it i know that they trained you in the language and um that's that's what i was wondering about was whether they actually yeah you actually got paid too while in the Peace Corps it wasn't much but i guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses were covered yeah was it yeah wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps or some such thing yeah i think so yeah yeah but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here and take them to some other country that had different moral values something like Saudi Arabia where they couldn't drink where they couldn't do that yeah you might end up with a revolution i don't know which end though yeah really yeah i hadn't thought about that um-hum yeah yeah that's that's been interesting though the kids that have been over you know coming back right now you know yeah you wonder if being exposed to that for a while what percentage of them would actually say hey that's not a bad way to do it because from what i understand from some of the guys i know crime uh is punishable just almost uh instantly and public hangings and yeah in public yeah and this sort of thing you know so you don't have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes yeah yeah i've heard that like in China and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered them you know on the you know street so yeah yeah well i guess that's uh the price of freedom i guess is a little anyway the uh uh the the public service thing again i i i i guess in my own having had the whole three or four minutes to you know give it a great deal of thought here uh yeah i i think i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary but when you do that then it becomes almost uh or it can be yeah you know there are people will kind of set up their own little club yeah that's true and uh but if you know if you start the people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that yeah might not go if it was voluntary but i don't know how they'd enforce it if it was yeah well if they went AWOL what are you going to do shoot them put them in jail yeah i don't know send them over to Iraq have a vacation in Iraq for a year yeah yeah yeah right yeah i know my dad always talked about uh he was in uh CCC during uh the depression and he was uh a rock rib Iowa type republican and the only good thing he could ever say about uh the yeah the whole Roosevelt administration was uh civilian conservation corps he because he was in it he thought that was great the rest of it was all hog wash but the that was great um-hum yeah well it seems like it would develop pride you know in people if if it's in their own country it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the um-hum things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way i i it would take quite a few people i think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that so maybe that part of it would be helpful too um-hum yeah i don't know yeah the only i'd like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know what would you have who who who would determine what these people do yeah yeah you know if uh you know if it's run by the individual state you know like CCC was run by the army and in effect um-hum and the only opposition to it really was that it was you know starting starting some sort of a military elitist type you know special corps of cadre of people that sort of thing and uh when the politics get real confusing um-hum um-hum yeah really there could be um some uh scandals involved if you know it wasn't people that were really fair and um-hum leaving it you know in a legal way or something they could send all the people over to uh you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to you know get supported or yeah well we've we've gotten to the point where you know if if if well it would be open for if the racial make up of the group was such and such you know they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and you know all this kind of thing yeah that could be a complicated too couldn't it yeah oh yeah suppose uh well you know they they had a group who were construction oriented and they went and they they built uh can't think of a good example a swimming poo l or anything you know and one you can you can only build it in one place you know and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream well you didn't build one over here yeah that's true unfair or something yeah yeah yeah i think uh oh boy it's one of those things on the surface you know it seems like a great idea it's like a joke i heard once about uh elephant foot soup you know it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot it's it's uh it's the logistics of the thing that uh that that gets you going yeah really yeah well it seems like there's there's a lot you don't hear much on the news about young people really you know wanting to do anything good or anything like that but you know i'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing i just i saw on the news the other night that the uh the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show Kisha Knight Pullman was starting a i guess now she's practically a teenager yeah she started some type of um national um organization for youth to volunteer to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards um-hum you know helpful things and i know even like in the high schools in Dallas there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a um minority you know um i think it was in a Hispanic area they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers instead of they said every all these gangs kids could join to belong um-hum but they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know so they were trying to start that out so if there's people out there that are yeah willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy gosh we ought to use them you know yeah if their willing to do it yeah it's it's it's just the you know here you to the logistics of the thing again you know who yeah who's going to run it you know what how oh it's just so many yeah yeah well like like i said at the beginning i've got so many connections with people in Central America my daughter-in-law is Panamanian you know and they have situations like like that down there where they hum um-hum they have these the social in some sort of way if you want to go to school outside the country and many Salvadorians did they'd go to school in Cornell Iowa of all places huh and when they came back they'd have to serve this this this year and it turned out to be kind of a joke the ones i knew you know always chose the Red Cross because they didn't do anything oh i see and they had all kinds of uh things they could go into agricultural and you know really you know good stuff but uh unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that Red Cross yeah it was so many of them in it that at any particular chance your chance of having to do something was very slim it was very slim and so yeah yeah well we um belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints which is like the nickname the Mormon church um-hum um-hum and um the there is men and also women women aren't um nearly as frequent and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left that can volunteer to go on a mission and um they're all over the world and its it is an incredible logistics i mean they have a training center where they teach them it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah and they have to be taught the language um-hum customs and all those kinds of things and then they um you know go and actually live in that country for the the uh young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months okay then that's uh kind of a private right organization you know i'm i'm familiar with my instructor pilot was a was a Mormon he was because he was a good construction uh you know instructor instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible oh he had a direct connection somewhere uh yeah yeah right he felt that he really had an in so you know he things he would do with an airplane but any rate that's off the subject no i haven't seen i haven't seen yeah yeah but see they don't get paid for it and um but there is funding that that comes they're supposedly saving up on their own and the church helps them out some you know um-hum but you know that it is incredible you you know i seen how they were organized in in central and South America and uh it's uh yeah it's very involved well um with credit cards is me i uh i try to get maybe just one or two i don't i don't like having credit cards for every store i i uh i just don't like them what are you afraid of with them what am i afraid of um i don't know if i'm really afraid of spending too much i just uh don't think that i need them you know i uh yes they are tempting at times but i i just you know sometimes i just don't like everybody knowing everything about me you know so well that's very can be very very true so and the you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money so well that's the idea they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it and yeah uh-huh that's right see they make money off of it whether you use it or not absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest that's right uh-huh i use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that i can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing right uh-huh that's what i do that's what i do just a second Whitney i will i'm on the phone honey sorry that's all right sounds like you have a little one there oh you have great how old are they i have two little ones yeah yeah so that always want some um four and two and half oh boy those are two very active age yes so yeah um i'm i'm like you i i use my only use my credit card for um you know when i you know i just use it whenever i feel like i don't want to write a check and then but i don't charge anything that i can't payoff at the end of the month uh-huh well uh do you uh do you ever use the ATM machines so no i never do my husband does at work just to get cash out but uh i take the checkbook so i you know i just if i need cash i just tell him and he gets it out and i don't even think i know my number well i find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash uh-huh that's right see we he couldn't do without it he but you know since he can just do it right there at work for nothing oh that helps right well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash yeah uh-huh and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on you're right and that's kind of silly yeah right absolutely because they figure that that's correct the idea is to use their money yeah your defeating the purpose yeah and uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month yeah yeah i mean i get i get at least one or two a week people to you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i don't want it because i um-hum right well i think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted yeah yeah it's like i'd like to know where they determine that i'm such a good credit risk that they can go and say you get this much credit line you know you've already been preapproved well it and oh absolutely preapproved that's their favorite word yes everybody in the country is preapproved i think i think so you're right well it's interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go so yeah uh-huh yeah and then some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find you know one day they find wow i didn't realize i had this much you know i'd spent this much money and then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it that much spent right well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem uh-huh yeah it does because you're you know you you're you know you're just costing costing yourself more money because you if you can't make the monthly the minimum payment you're paying interest again so yeah that's right that's right well it's been enjoyable talking with you yes it's enjoyable talking with seeing that somebody feels the same way so well you you too good luck bye-bye right well take good care take care of your little ones uh-huh bye-bye okay Ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy well as a matter of fact i was thinking about that the other day and uh i really don't know the answer um i would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not any not you know a luxury type sporty one but um yeah something that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things oh you do want a lot of that stuff yeah well yeah i like i like some of those things they come in really handy what kind of uh things are you going to consider you know what uh you said something about the about the well what do you call them you said amenities amenities that they have but what about um their reputation of the company or the price um well of course i guess uh price is always the big consideration but it is for me other people don't seem to have the same problem yeah well that's that's a big one in my book but uh um yeah i have preferences for uh for some um makers over others um and i would sort of like to buy American yeah but you know i'm not so totally hung up on that that i wouldn't buy something else how about you well um the last car we bought was American because of because of that reason but have not been entirely happy with um several things about the car it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be oh really because several things minor things sort of but still they cost us money um that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay on a car that that was that new um-hum you know we bought the car new and after um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch oh and they just said well you know clutches are disposable and i said since when brake pads are disposable you know we know that but i never thought a clutch was disposable yeah yeah yeah i wouldn't have thought so either yeah so that was that was kind of a shock oh oh yeah i i guess there's a lot to to think about when you're trying to make that decision yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like like uh um a Mercedes Benz they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable right you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes no but then um especially not after two years no but on the other hand i guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune really oh i don't know yeah i've uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh Mercedes and um-hum even though they do a lot of the work themselves then just buying the parts and everything is is pretty expensive but for them it's it's sort of a hobby too to own them yeah what kind of what brand of car are you thinking about buying or like what things are you looking at well i haven't really really gotten that far with it um i've always sort of liked General Motors a little bit better than some of the others but uh um-hum oh i guess i really don't know how come i've been kind of um i guess the commercials are getting to me the Toyota commercials and i know that a lot of people i've i've known that have had Toyotas have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any problems at all yeah yeah that i think that's i think they have a really good um quality um-hum my uh daughter has owned two different ones and uh you know we've had some work done on them but it's not too bad and the reason one of the reasons we um bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a Toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years and he lived way out in the country so he put a lot of miles on it um-hum and you knew it had had been through a whole lot um-hum and yet you know it it held up pretty doggone good so yeah i thought they would they seem to be really durable yeah so i don't know i'm i'm not ready to buy a new car yet but i don't know if if the next time i'm going to try to to stay with buying something American or if i'm going to go for a little more what i would consider to be a long-term investment yeah well and i guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know you oh it's easy to get gas mileage in this car it gets excellent gas mileage yeah yeah that's one of the big throwing cards for some of the foreign ones um-hum well we talked long enough i think so okay well enjoyed it bye-bye all righty thanks bye-bye alrighty uh i'll just hand it off to you and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today well uh the hobbies that i pursue in my spare time are crafts and uh i've been involved in making uh hat stand and uh rag dolls and uh different type hats with um flowers and roses you know and uh that kind of thing straw hats and all that kind of stuff hm and i enjoy it it's relaxing and you kind of get absorbed in it so the time goes by you know before you realize anything's going on and i play the organ sometimes uh just for my own satisfaction not for anybody else's ears because i'm not that good at it but i like to bang the keyboards once in a while how about yourself oh really well oh hobbies gee whiz i guess i got too many hobbies so i never have time to deal with them i like photography a lot uh really oh yeah that's neat i used to do that a lot and then i like um we have a new child that'll be a year old here next week so i'll take a lot of pictures of her you know and spoil them first one you know how that is and um uh oh that's great uh-huh i play the guitar and a banjo i mainly play the guitar a lot you know i play it about every night and um i really love that if i had a druther if i could've if i could make it on the road i'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something because that's oh that sounds nice i like bluegrass too i've yeah i've done it before and when i was in high in high school and college and thoroughly enjoyed it and and it's really a a blast my wife hates it but that's the way life is i guess uh-huh that's the hard part right exactly if you can do things together that really helps a lot uh the well yeah we uh she's uh into the aerobics and uh oh well that's good too and and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half and that went over real well but uh that's about it there uh-huh oh it's good and it's healthy too oh yeah yeah we do that too we have a uh a treadmill and uh a bicycle and that kind of stuff we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week you know yeah and we like movies oh that's great that's great yep that's uh spare time with a child it's kind of stressful she's we have uh we're looking for a baby sitter so we've been out twice in one in this year so far by ourselves without the child so it's kind of yeah uh-huh uh become an issue you could say um hobbies i like sure messing around in your house building things and you know put cabinets up and those kind of things um oh yeah that's great too uh-huh yeah we did some remodeling when we bought a house we built put a kitchen in and um that kind of stuff and painting and some wallpapering that's fun it is it really is it's really kind of fun especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty yeah yep exactly i like things that uh you know two people can do but i like the quiet of doing things away you know kind of gives you some space for yourself and that's what i find in making the dolls and things that it gives me something that i can create and i like to crochet and knit i made some afghans and that kind of stuff i like doing things with my hands uh-huh sounds like it do you like to cook that yeah yes i love to cook yeah i love to cook too i'm a Italian food yeah pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff oh really well we're all skinny farts so i it so when it comes i like to cook and eat and to have mainly mainly i guess i get the enjoyment out of people eating it and saying man this is really good um yeah uh-huh yeah it is um but it it just work in the garden work around the yard of course do you do barbecues yes we we sure do smoke them and for uh uh uh smoking and all that stuff oh yeah all that hoe down stuff yeah all that stuff that's bad for you yeah yep i i lived in Abilene for a little while oh sure yeah and uh worked in the Abilene plant and we used to go to Joe Allen's Barbecue and oh that was great oh yeah really great they have some nice stuff down there that's uh only way to do it i miss it well yeah it's uh it's uh it's uh there's uh there's pluses to everything but yeah it seems like there's just so many things to do down here i like the sports side i play a lot of racquetball oh yeah oh we did horseback i i did horseback riding too in fact when my children were growing up we always had horses and uh that was kind of for them but they weren't as interested in it as we were you know so uh that was a real i'd say probably for maybe fifteen years we dabbled in that you know we always had horses around and i really enjoyed that oh that's great sound like you and i was disappointed when i went to Texas i didn't see that many of them yes horses yeah you really don't yeah there's there's a you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete uh i know i know it's true there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people and that's about it down here and it's uh yeah but uh that's great well sound like you have a lot of nice hobbies there uh-huh yeah you too you too well great well look uh i know it's probably late for you uh enjoyed speaking with you have a good weekend bye-bye okay me too okay bye now okay i don't know which end do we push but okay okay well um let's see i i think uh there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard and you know there's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States and that you know their votes votes not going to make that much difference and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in and that person is going to have a lot of uh since there's so many issues this one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them so right it'd be really difficult to have that one person perfect person that believed exactly what you believed yeah that's true you know a lot of people uh uh i think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the polly uh the party type followers the guys that uh you know follow the party lines you know and they you know just go in and if they're Republican they vote Republican vote Republican every year you know and uh the people that are independent hum yeah you know are the ones that don't uh don't really uh show up every year because they can't seem to to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate right yeah that's good yeah yeah i always thought it was back when Anderson was running i was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes but that didn't work yeah yeah there's uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the Democrats they're real liberal now to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um the Democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like uh moral standings and those kinds of things um-hum but yeah yeah that's uh and and then people always get upset about it too because you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote they they each think that uh if more people vote they'll get more votes um-hum i'm always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know yeah yeah that's that's true i think in uh the Texas governor election i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time yeah well that uh that's something i i know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a predominately predominately predominately Catholic type area oh really and when things start uh when when abortion comes on the issues then people just get all inspirational inspired you know and uh right still on the other hand we're also uh this particular community is a Catholic community but uh uh down in DC where where things are a little bit different uh um-hum you know it's it's women's rights and the and and that sort of movement and so it's uh quite the opposite so elections start getting very uh the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones yeah that's true and uh but uh yeah that's true that the different places in America that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place yeah i can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout isn't as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in DC are like controlling things for the the Midwest and uh it doesn't matter who they put in office they're going to fall subject to uh um-hum the pressure that lobbyists can put right yeah and it's uh well real true that uh you you know they'll say one thing to get elected and then once they do get elected they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand right you know maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing you know that's uh with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to yeah even try to do yeah well i don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected right uh right after the war uh-huh that really uh unfortunately that'll probably even drop lower the voters turn down even more uh turnout even more because more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot so they won't even bother turning out uh that's true yeah they'll just say oh well you know the Republicans have this election we'll see you in four years right yeah uh but yeah i hope some of the local well that's what they they keep saying that it seems like people with it with old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the at the booths they they say that these older voters that uh you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country so they they don't come out turn out to vote and they're the ones that uh you know really know what's going on have the experience and have seen you know how politicians can you know screw up or whatever um-hum but i know my grandmother hasn't voted in years right that's right you know neither has mine as a matter of fact and uh that's true they i think they look at it as well everybody the majority of the people think this way when that's not necessarily true because you know that's what the media says well the majority believes this way so uh they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their uh opinions um-hum so that's that's true yeah wonder if they're going to take into account with this commutiv uh this computerized conversation that there's little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking yeah do you hear the dogs in the background here okay they're no i can't hear them the children next door just opened the fence and they went off yeah but anyway that's i guess we've uh talked long enough and that was sort of interesting what part of the country are you from oh yeah yeah uh Washington DC um-hum are you really wow this is i'm in from this is Dallas where i'm at the outskirts of Dallas oh okay well i figured with Texas Instruments they'd probably have a few uh Texans on the line now and then yeah do do you work for TI in any way no huh-uh wow how did you how did they get you or uh basically they they went through engineering companies and uh we're communications i work i work in a com munications company oh oh okay right i work for TI so we saw it on the uh the TV News one day and i thought wow that might be interesting yeah yeah we sort of different yeah they called me at uh ten o'clock one night that was very strange well yeah i guess they were doing it Eastern Standard Time i was like well i don't know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes so i yeah Central Standard Time's what they're doing it by yeah yeah i still haven't figured out what the zero through six days which day is which yet but i didn't study it that hard so maybe i'll figure it out um-hum but anyway it was nice to talk to you and uh sort of meet you and that was an interesting topic okay yeah okay well if you're ever in uh DC can look up Wayne Sherman you'll say oh yeah talked to that guy okay okay i'm i'm Kyle Hunt too if you ever come to to Dallas area well we live right by the airport oh okay yeah yeah yeah so do we oh okay yeah right next to Dulles all right well i'll talk to you later bye-bye yeah okay bye here goes Sharon okay well what do you think about Nolan Ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars that's the only thing i found out tonight oh you found that out tonight i hadn't even heard that that's great i think he deserves every penny of it yeah yeah but there are some others out there that i don't believe deserve the money they're getting well isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would oh yeah wonder because football and they play a lot they play a lot longer season too and a lot more games right yep that's exactly right uh-huh but i think let's see the teams that were there last year were see somebody from California i don't even know who won the pennant last year beats me i mean i know Yankees have won a lot of games through the years yeah not lately though we have been talking about this i tried to call earlier uh-huh and we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from then i started cleaning and i don't know where i even put that paper i yeah i was just cleaning and throwing threw it away oh gosh let's see the teams that i think the A's were in it last year the Oakland A's and i think it was i don't think it was an all California baseball well have you ever played baseball i play softball well that's what i did when i was growing up yeah that was fun yeah that's fun that's a whole different sport uh-huh yeah let's see but i think i think the Rangers need to go and i think the Pirates will go and uh let's see Rangers have got a new guy this year i don't remember his name either do you ever go see the Rangers every once in a while i i like to go on the nights when there's not anybody out there not very many people out there it's a lot more fun when you're not fighting a crowd yeah i think it's fun i like just looking at the billboards yeah but sometimes when i if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun yeah it's nice at night yeah that's when i've been it is and and do you know anything about that new stadium have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there well no yeah that that huge it's suppose to be a huge stadium and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it and uh they're going to try to make it a real community center out there and you're going to be able to buy your what was no wait of course what was it about the liquor that's that's in uh Texas stadium where the football players play was that oh yeah see you just and they're never going to let liquor in there well they're trying i know but they try every year and every year they get thrown out it's so stupid because they let you take it in there but they don't they don't allow you to sell it don't allow them to sell it there uh-huh but uh that new stadium's going to be real nice and i heard that there's uh that you can bid on that stadium last night on the news i heard they said you could you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you kind of right it's going to it's going to go to the highest bidder oh well that's the way to do it so yeah so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame you hear that that's my kids turning on their music let me see Holly turn it down oh i think it's the Bartman the Simpsons oh God i stay away from them i wish i could i bet you do yeah well where are you in Plano okay i'm in Garland oh you are yeah my husband my husband teaches in Plano oh what's he teach C V A E uh-huh so what do you do i teach but i teach for Dallas oh you do for right now i'm trying to get out is that a tough system to be in uh-huh real hard uh-huh i mean it's good because they they try new things you know but it's like yeah i would think it they'll try something and then they throw it out and get something else you know and you get tired of that yeah that's typical bureaucracy though that's that's i think it's going to be any where you go it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones i don't know sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad yeah well but they can't be though they don't have as much money yeah but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes most the time oh man but in Dallas you don't even know who's in in administration there's so many of them you don't even know who to payoff huh i mean somebody walks in the classroom and you don't know what they're there for you know when they're coming how long they're going to be yeah oh how funny you know it's just them there they are and they're writing the whole time no communication whatsoever no i had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything and i finally got to where i go okay i'm Debbie Moore you know may i ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for you know because you know you never know where they're going what they'll report or yeah i know and they'll tell you they've written something down and you and you haven't you and you never see it hope they're telling you no huh-uh that's got to be frustrating oh it is how long have you taught taught Dallas schools uh this is my eleventh year ooh that's about uh ten too many no actually it's now my job's good much better than a lot yeah uh-huh because i'm Chapter One and all i do is teach reading all day long yeah oh and it's just ten children at a time well that's not bad no it's good and you've got a lot of federal money too but hasn't it changed a lot over the years teaching oh yes yeah or working in the system yes when i first started teaching i remember i went up to my job and i said okay i want to see a curriculum guide you know so i'll know what i'm suppose to teach and they go we don't have one of we don't even know where one is oh God and i go okay i mean you just you did what you wanted to do oh how funny and now they tell you what to teach and how long and you know what day yeah you don't know which is you don't know which is worse what period yeah no i know which is worse yeah i guess so yeah being told what to do is worse um-hum so how long are we suppose to talk for well you can talk for ten minutes but you don't have to oh you can yeah and no if you talk to ten then they come over on and say oh you've extended your limit and please say good-bye within the next five seconds oh i haven't ever talked that long well you know i hadn't either till last night i was talking to this retired administrator from Cleveland Ohio we started talking about gangs you know oh how funny he lives in Cleveland yeah wow and everybody else that i've talked to has been right around here yeah but she was real interesting huh and then tonight this woman called have you taken any incoming calls the yours is my second one okay so hers was the first one i got gotten and uh oh she was telling me all her problems and it went over ten minutes did she did she did you all not talk about the topic at all well yeah we did but the topic was boring i thought what would you serve uh if you were having a dinner party oh oh gosh what was i'm trying to remember oh the other the one i talked about the other night was good it was um about movies you know who what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that oh yeah i could go on and on about that me too because we go all the time the guy i was talking to never goes he was boy it sounds like your really up on this and i said i see at least two a week so ooh neat that was real good to talk about that have you seen like uh Silence Of The Lambs no you've got to go see that the last one i saw was Dances Of The With The Wolves Of The Wolves yeah we talked about that one too and he he said he didn't think it should of gotten all those awards he thought it was too long but oh i enjoyed it i mean it was just more for my money i i did too yeah i didn't think it was too long at all um he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch huh the other one you need to go see is Sleeping With The Enemy uh-huh and how old are your kids one is eight and one is eleven you probably don't want to take them to see Silence Of The Lambs it's it's not it's not too cool for kids they usually pick their own i bet they do you know they've got it all figured out yeah they want to see all the horror movies well and Ninja Turtles yeah Ninja Turtles got to have those but most of the time really we watch them on the video don't you just massive rental oh yeah you bring that's well heck that's a lot cheaper then uh taking them out to the show going to i know especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all at one night one time that's what we do especially when it's bad weather man just yeah plug it in of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything i know decent well it's good when you go to Tom Thumb though and they're cheap and nobody's got them yet unbelievable that's true that's true we saw um Heroes Has Always Been Cowboys tonight uh-huh it was okay it was kind of slow and i felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know it just it and i don't know it one of those movies it's not going to be around long it'll be a dollar movie in no time do you read not very much no no i don't have the patience to read see i do that to make myself go to sleep at night yeah oh my mom and dad read all the time you saw Field Of the Dreams right a long time ago yeah sure did so i was reading the book and it's called Shoeless Joe oh really it was so wonderful and then i was um i decided well i like this author so i got a uh book of his short stories and that's been real good who's the who's the author don't don't ask me The Ghost Of Shoeless Joe was the name of the book oh Shoeless Joe was it like the movie yes quite a quite a bit but you know in the movie the guy was black okay right he wasn't in the book huh that's one difference there really wasn't a lot of difference i didn't uh see i never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie um-hum that's interesting so that was a good movie too well do you think we've covered baseball i think so okay well have a good night okay i'll let you start first okay okay we um i'm presently living in a house uh first time uh we had the house built and so this is our our fifth year in it i guess and uh um it was a really excitement to uh to go out and select a house and have one made and built and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses and um as we did with probably ninety five percent of the people here in Dallas Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home and they're good for about five years or four years and after that they start falling apart so i would um not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in uh because they're overpriced um but they're a cheap house if you can't afford something good you know they're good for that and um you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head but as far as the costs for what your getting uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it how about in your case well in my case my husband is not a carpenter but in fact he's in electronics but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it so it took him about two and a half years but uh he built us a house it's uh we have thirty two hundred square feet and it's a brick house and pricewise it wasn't great because he did it all hisself you know so that way he could we could kind of control in control it um-hum and um we live in kind of a small town um-hum and i mean it's nothing fancy you know it's it's a house it's nice and it's real pretty and we're all comfortable in it well that's great that's great that's uh i've heard i have another gentleman friend of mine who uh who had a house built matter of fact another guy's building one now he's been doing it for three years and the city's a little upset with him but i understand you save a lot of money off uh by doing that and uh oh you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else nothing wrong with that uh i'll vouch for that you know um so but uh of course my husband did everything except my brother's a trim carpenter and he came in you know and did the inside for us and that helped and and uh yes and uh we had to hire course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing you know he did everything else that was a big savings well that's great well have you been in it long we've been in it six years oh really well have you do you have any plans to uh maybe um expand or move onward no no well well uh our kids are kind of still small now and we had thought before when they get a lot older we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it but he will not build a second one himself because he says agewise he'll never be able to handle that again yes yes i see well first one's always a bear we're having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us and uh that can basically be be be put on any lot in any state any country you know so that's kind of the um we just got with him and told him what all we wanted and he's charging about a buck a square foot to design it and he's registered certified and registered so at least we know we're it's not gonna fall in or something if it's built but uh i have heard uh-huh yeah oh that your approach is is is right you can actually go out and sub it if even if you don't wanna get hands on you can even just sub it out the concrete and those kind of things and and that's kind of the plan i have so um uh everyone i talk to uh i've uh-huh yes i file in my little book and do other things with it uh that's great that's great but uh like i said otherwise you know a the the expense but you know we could not had one as large as we have if you know we hadn't did it ourself sure i can imagine yeah i mean it's not a Eldorado house or anything like that but you know it's ours if your happy with it that's all that counts that's right that's right that's only only uh you only have to uh satisfy yourself and no one else apparently apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high isn't it it really is ooh and that's uh that's uh a a encouraging sign if you ever wanna resell it i guess because i i'm always shocked at about you know what they've got have it appraised at i think oh my goodness a lot of money i bet well that's great well yeah i guess that about does it okay and it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye nice talking with you too bye do you feel that uh drug testing is necessary at the workplace um i have mixed feelings about it um i don't particularly care for people who take drugs and uh it's a possibility of having accidents in the workplace but um i also feel like it's an invasion of privacy yeah i have some basic concerns about it as well uh not just the invasion of privacy but the the chance of uh false positive being being reported right right uh i have been drug tested in the past and it's not really a pleasant experience at work um-hum um-hum and uh it gives you the uh impression the uh impression that the company really doesn't trust the people that work for them right and you're pretty much uh assumed to be guilty until proven innocent by the test results right yeah yeah i have a lot of problems with it um i um i have been tested also several times and uh in fact it has always come up negative i mean but that's no problem with it yeah coming up negative but i do take prescription drugs and i'm always been afraid that those were going to come up and show something on any of the tests yeah well they make uh allowances for that if you report that at the time that you take the test yeah but there's always a chance that you forget and have to justify it later right or if the prescription say ran out or if you're using something that's uh older than older than the date uh on the package or whatever um-hum right right yeah but i agree with you though they uh they're trying to uh you know they're they're saying that you are guilty until proven innocent and uh and i don't really appreciate that at all yeah yeah if they do come up with a positive regardless of what uh what it was they detected uh we're required to go attend a uh a counseling session um-hum and uh that gets put in your permanent uh files on your record right it's just not not a real good uh thing to have on your uh employment uh records no no because this can follow you um at other places too i was reading uh this morning in the newspaper where it was talking about um they have companies or or organizations out now who will go and do background searches on uh employees before they ever hire them sure and if you get one of those false negative reportings and and you're fired from your job that's going to carryover into other jobs um no matter um you know if it's truth or not so yeah it can stick with you for a long time yeah uh according to uh to the way that that our test is set up apparently everyone is supposed to be tested within a five year period right and uh they they do it on a random basis i'm not sure how they can guarantee that everybody is going to be tested within five years if it really is random um-hum um-hum so i'm not sure exactly what they base that on well uh cause you work for TI also right yeah because uh i think what they say what they would uh take your name out of the hopper yeah um-hum sure so that whatever is left in the hopper you know it's it's um uh that's when you'd be tested and then when you were tested then it'd be taken out of there so that's that's how they said they would uh do it over a five year period okay well i'm not sure exactly if that's true though because i know people that have been tested more than one time um-hum and many have not been tested yet um well it's only been what a year two years uh couple of years yeah um-hum um-hum yeah it hadn't been i know i was called up right away it didn't no i was called up let's see yeah we started testing in January and i was called up right away in January okay it took them awhile to find me oh no well they they did all the all the top level managers uh-huh uh at first uh-huh and uh everybody else uh gets to take their turn right right so they called me in uh just a few months ago um-hum yeah but yeah you're right that wasn't a very pleasant experience right especially i felt like there was a camera watching oh no i never thought about that i i had some questions for the for the the nurse who was uh conducting the test in the health center though uh-huh asked her if she enjoyed her job what'd she say she thought it was different you get to meet a lot of people yeah on a continuing basis too so i try i try to introduce some levity there you know that was uh that was a really interesting because it was a great big room the bathroom it was it was a great big room and uh and i remember the the vents you know just right over the top of the toilet uh-huh yeah and and i just just knew i was being photographed you know i just i'm glad i don't have to go through that experience again yeah yeah well there are a lot of people who express uh much stronger feelings about it than i have yeah and in fact i know some people that uh probably will quit before being tested even though there's nothing to uh to worry about as far as i know from the test results just a matter of principle right yeah yeah well um i guess growing up in the sixties and uh i don't know that particular era and generation i think about it though whether i have some friends who are occasional uh marijuana smokers and oh yeah you know it's just a hangover i guess from uh from that particular generation and uh but yeah they're they're just adamant that they're not going to be you know tested and they're going to fight it and um you know try and um see what they can do that it's an invasion of privacy but i don't particularly care to uh you know to uh to get into drugs or anything else so it's not a problem for me but i uh i can kind of understand from the other point of view yeah well i know some people that i suspect are casual users of uh marijuana as well and i expect that they probably uh mended their ways uh in uh um-hum in response to this uh drug testing that they no longer uh even use anything like that on a casual basis right yeah yeah because it is a matter of of losing your job if you get caught say a second time um-hum and even the first time uh for these people are uh oh well on their way in on on the technical ladder or management and they're jeopardizing their positions yeah oh yeah yeah i i could really see t hat uh so yeah they'll just have to find other means of uh relaxing and yeah yeah but the one thing too that that i have a problem with is that well if marijuana and cocaine and the other those so-called uh illegal drugs you know what about alcohol well some companies have gone that far uh TI has not um-hum um-hum but others have and they're setting themselves up for uh more lawsuits i think than uh i think so yeah yeah but you know alcohol destroys you know so many families so now than we are so that's that's what i thought was interesting that uh there are still drugs out there and then there are those socially acceptable drugs yeah right i don't mind so much the fact that they test people but uh not questioning the validity of the results is is a problem because uh you know um-hum uh i i i fully expect that that any test results that comeback for me would be negative that in in the event that one would be positive there's no recourse other than get yourself a lawyer or go to this counseling session and admit guilt uh they won't accept anything else um-hum oh yeah yeah yeah because you'd be strongly into denial it's just like well we know you take it we've got the positive test results and you're going i don't i don't right yeah well if if you turn down the counseling they they will fire you right that's uh condition of employment right right yeah i think there's some flaws in it i i think their main objective is is good you know to make sure they have a drug free workplace but i do think that there are a lot of flaws in there sure and i understand that the government will not use that particular drug testing agency that that TI is using is that right um yeah because they're not as reliable as the government wants them to be i thought that's the only one that the government does use so oh well i heard just the opposite i'm not sure so i don't know it could just be rumors that spread around you know when they okay yeah there aren't just too many places uh that do testing like that where the government uh uh gives well gives them full reign uh trust the results because they have to prove on a continual basis that uh that they are meeting um their standards for false positives and whatnot um-hum yeah right um-hum they claim uh zero false positives ever and i find that very hard to believe oh yeah that that to me yeah it'd be very hard to believe too okay well uh hum is our five minutes up okay well it was nice talking to you okay bye i think yeah i'm sure it is i think that about covers what we want to talk about i enjoyed it okay sure bye happen to know what the laws are in Texas uh capital punishment is uh you know accepted an accepted punishment it it's legal uh-huh uh there are uh there have been a number of executions over the last few years hum uh they drag you know the the appeals drag on interminably it seems sometimes um personally i kept i keep thinking that if i could be guaranteed that the people who perpetrate some of these vicious crimes were never allowed free then i would not be in favor of capital punishment but when oh i see what you're saying but uh when i know that uh they could be paroled and go right back to doing what they did before i i feel decidedly uneasy uneasy about it huh what about New York well in New York i'm not quite sure but what sounds familiar to me is that it's it's not legal except in cases of murder of police officers uh-huh okay i might be mistaken but that's what sounds familiar to me um-hum so uh so we don't hear about it well yeah i was visiting in California recently and apparently they over about two weeks ago they just executed one fellow um-hum it is legal there but they they always put it off and put it off and they finally for the first time in twenty five years executed someone yes um-hum yes so that was quite the news i remember reading about that um is it only usually in cases of murder sort of an eye for an eye kind of thing it's uh it's more than that i think it's a capital murder uh where uh there there was an intent to do other harm as well you know where you you engaged in another felony like robbery at at the same time that you murdered someone okay i know there's a a subtle subtle difference between manslaughter and murder yes i guess you can commit manslaughter by running somebody over by accident that kind of thing by accident yes uh-huh that's my understanding of it uh but that uh murder is something that you do intentionally uh-huh uh i don't know it just seems to me that everybody wants to know if they do something what's going to happen to them um-hum i substitute teach and i have kids who talk fresh don't do homework and they say so what's going to happen to me and and people getting less and less respect and they understand they know that the bottom line is not very much is going to happen to them um-hum so if i could be sure that the people who are sentenced to execution absolutely did it because you know during the with the jury system you're not quite sure um-hum no you're not you know i i i'd feel comfortable with it if i knew absolutely certainly that this person actually murdered someone um-hum um-hum or but i i think the reason we don't go for it is because we're afraid that we might be making a mistake and you can't fix it that's right and and it's a terrible thing to do uh and the world our world seems to become more and more violent all the time by the way i'm a public school administrator so okay well did you do you find that the kids are changing and they they don't they they don't respect authority anymore oh at all they they do not respect authority uh they kill for fun i uh they shoot guns for amusement after parties um hum well the guns are legal where you are it's quite a to do to get a gun around here legally that is yes well it it's not it's not legal to carry a handgun in Texas but no it's not you can have it in your home oh i didn't know that okay or in your car if you're traveling from one city to another oh okay that clears that but uh rifles shotguns those sorts of guns are legal um-hum well they can do just as much damage oh yes it's just that they're harder to hide that's true but i do i feel decidedly uneasy about the judicial system in our country now not only because we can't be sure that the jury you know has made the right decision that the person who did it's really guilty or really isn't guilty and yet i feel very uncomfortable about the numbers of people who are paroled put back on the streets and within a few months are raping and killing other people and you say you have some strong feelings about uh the issue uh yes i do as far as uh as far as uh as far as immigration as a whole goes uh-huh i think that uh we simply must start accepting everybody in the world uh-huh uh i there just is not gonna be room for all of us we don't have jobs now i i think uh i think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time um hope you're one of the employed right now uh-huh i am one of the unemployed right now i was a systems analyst and programmer for an oil company and uh i applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings but they had two thousand applications oh and i know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here you you know doing my line of work uh-huh and of course i'm not perfectly happy about not having a job right so how do you feel well i'm a little bit ambivalent the problem with uh and i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it uh in in terms of what uh really is driving it they're not willing to tell the truth the same way with um uh issues of uh race and things like that i mean right now um i believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration three actually one is at the high end uh they always wanna be able to um do some brain draining they'd always like to be able to attract the uh Einsteins or the Professor Chou or you know they'd like to be able to get the top people in any field and so they can almost always find room for someone like that right at the bottom end they um are always willing to um let in cheap labor if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area those are two things that i think are going on although they i i i don't think the politicians would tell you that okay and i think you're right in both cases and then the third thing is uh the political aspect of uh uh letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico they cannot close off the Mexican border not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be uh uh would spill over to this country so they keep allowing um the pressure cooker to um let off steam and i think probably it's pretty important right there how do you feel about Haitian immigration uh that's one of the few things i guess i found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan i think they're very difficult group to integrate into uh society they're very difficult um group to find jobs and uh and uh places for and so um um i don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that uh in that they're pretty miserable where they are but i'm not to sympathetic about um letting large numbers of Haitians in actually actually i feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here yeah and it would have nothing to do with political situations it would have to do with poverty right but if you let them yeah if you let them in a million at a time it wouldn't make that you know it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population but politically politically and economically oh my gosh have you been to have you been to Southern Florida yeah well i know about it uh i mean it's it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans uh twenty years ago well i mean and the two of them together i mean we can it's just as well you know it's hardly America anymore on the other hand you know it the ironic thing about this is that there's nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than a first generation immigrant so there's uh uh there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in but there's some differences in the immigrants that that we're getting now well in i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration right sure i think probably your your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals right but uh the majority of the illegal immigration we're getting now they do not come here to blend into America uh they they don't bother to learn our language and uh first of all they've they've i'm sorry this i really feel strongly about this we send a lot of money to Mexico um-hum um-hum uh i i hope i don't consider them a uh threat because uh uh we sure have taken down a lot of security measures that that we once had um i don't know seems um um maybe a little bit young to remember the uh i'm only i'm i'm twenty two so i don't think i remember the uh uh you know the height of the Cold War and and whatnot but i huh-uh i don't know i don't consider the Soviet Union a threat in that uh by any means just because of the fact that there's not uh uh anything that they have to threaten us with anymore well there not i mean there really is no Soviet Union now unfortunately they still do have a lot of uh nuclear weapons exactly that's that's true that's uh-huh and uh the one thing that worries me is is question of stability and control um-hum and uh i think it's too early to say you know whether they're going to develop some stable societies there in one form or another um-hum or whether this uh old uh Russian tendency to turn their fate over to some insane ruler is going to surface again sure yeah they didn't they didn't have a very good track record even before the revolution no they really didn't uh now you know they never really have had democracy there in any sense so no no um it's going to take both democracy and economic progress and uh resolution of their nationalist institutes i guess right all of that is going to have to happen and if any one of them turn sour they could still be uh dangerous simply because they might not you know they just might sort of lose track of what they're doing right um i i guess i'm not so concerned about an organized danger uh maybe for the maybe for the simple reason that um despite the fact that they do have uh you know probably a large uh substantial nuclear capability uh i'm not sure that that all of that capability is organized anymore i mean you know just along with it with the dissolution the that the of the uh Soviet Union i think that a lot happened with the dissolution of their of their military power but that's really part of the danger because they still have uh you know i think there still uh missile uh bases or silos in uh um-hum in uh Kazakhstan probably in Ukraine right right as well as in Russia uh those in Russia may be some of them in areas that uh may have uh right strong local national sentiments because they aren't all Russians you know they're a lot of enclaves they have other nationalities yeah sure uh-huh and if even one uh missile silo got in the hands of someone who is uh determined to cause trouble for some for some reason they might launch a missile on someone i think i see your point uh you have you have uh where once you had uh one government controlling a a a large number of missiles now you have several smaller governments uh highly volatile governments and militaries and it's not always clear which one of them is in charge militaries yeah sure well that's maybe the uh the uh extreme pessimistic view um-hum um think if uh Yeltsin has a chance and if they can follow his lead in the other republics or whatever they want to call themselves now yeah um they'll probably come out of it okay um-hum uh do you see uh i have not perceived and i wonder if you've perceived any uh uh antiAmericanism uh sentiments uh on any level like you know that that we receive from the from the Middle East for example what in the former Soviet Union yeah um not much i don't think i think that uh probably or uh or uh image there is pretty good most places as i understand it right um-hum do you worry that we might uh overstep i guess my question is do you do you think that there are ways that we might overstep overstep our bounds and provoke uh provoke anger in the Soviet Union and and what would those what would those steps be provoke a threat what might make them angry at us may make the people angry at us or the governments or both or um-hum you know both i guess well i think if they uh thought that we were taking advantage of their uh current preoccupations with internal matters or with um-hum okay uh i just currently quit my job and so i really don't receive any benefits right now right but my husband does and um i think one of the um my first of all always salary and second the second thing is um because we have children so it'd be um health benefits and medical benefits and and um right now we have yeah yeah definitely probably some excellent benefits right now we have with Aetna and uh i don't know if you're familiar with them but we're real happy with them yeah yes i've had a variety of different jobs with of various types um in the computer field and so seen a variety of different types of benefits um i've worked for for for awhile and they are you know really um an academic type of place and then i've worked with regular you know industry type places and then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff so i've seen a wide range of both you know nonsalary type benefits and other stuff you know like health care that's either fully or partially paid and you know some have like bonuses and others have had lots of vacation time but not much of other types of benefits and um-hum so yeah i would i'd say health care is way up there especially for anybody with kids um yeah and that's one of the big things that we always look at you know when we when i think about taking changing jobs is you know you know what kind of health care they have and does the company pay for it you know all or partially or how does that work um-hum and um also um vacation time too is a is a big one for me yeah yeah um and i guess support for whatever whatever other you know kinds of professional activities you have at you know work yeah um because i've been at places which offer a lot of support and others that don't offer any hm right and some that sometimes that's coincided with a place that offers more vacation time though so that's not so bad um you know it's kind of a give and take kind of thing i think right yeah um-hum um i say that uh health care is probably definitely number one though uh you can wind up just losing you know losing all your salary can't can't even begin to pay for what you can wind up losing you know with a major illness or something yeah yeah um right um and and and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices and who to go with yeah and that really helped us out a great deal so but my husband does get vacation and it's worked out really good for us too uh-huh so but yeah yeah flexible hours are are pretty important to me as well um because that makes a big difference my wife works part time yeah um-hum and she works um as a assistant manager in a fabric store and so she works a lot of evenings and weekends uh-huh and so two days a week i um manage to get home early enough to meet the kids from the bus because she works you know goes in early those days and works like you know noon till close um so we have well that's great that y'all can work that out that's really good yeah and being on a you know rigid schedule wouldn't there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all right and i think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too because i mean usually you know you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting up for school and you get home and it's already dark unless it's summer time you know and even if it's summer sometimes you get home so late that there's you know you can't do anything with them um-hum yeah and especially in the winter i mean you get get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know it's like it's like a vampire sometimes yeah yeah yeah it's that same with my husband because he's got pretty flexible hours if as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do with that's worked out really well for us too yeah um well is there anything else that you look for or um a lot of it to i guess is you hit pretty you put a lot of the main points in yeah i think some it is how the uh you know i guess it's not really a direct benefit but how you um performance is rated and stuff like that at work um-hum because i've been uh especially in large corporations you can really you know wind up getting having you know real problems i've found out i've worked for a few you know several thousand plus you know type companies yeah and it especially if you're doing like professional work where there you know it's kind of ethereal as to what you're doing you know if you're like i've i work with uh computer systems a lot yeah so it's kind of hard to say you know if you're a you know brick layer somebody can look and see you know well yeah you laid you know fifteen thousand bricks today and they were all straight and your building didn't fall down you know yeah you did a great job if you build computer systems like well you know what does that computer program really do you know or if especially if you write like papers you know or do design studies or something it's real hard to rate something like that um-hum um-hum it's like being a painter or you know or something an artist it's like well jeez how do you really rate you know Michelangelo you know how would you tell if he was you know really good or so-so or whatever yeah no yeah and that does make want a person want to stay uh around here we have a program where uh we we put out the the we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers and we keep the newspapers in a in a their collected twice a month and the trash and this this bottled stuff uh that uh is put in a in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck so they may actually actually have about three passes at this collection that sounds one for the regular trash one for the uh um you know bottles and cans and one for the newspapers but i gather you do not separate uh the bottles and cans no they they do that on the truck they separate them as they as they you know dump them and you know one guy comes around with his truck and and dumps it all in there uh-huh and uh i think they're they're running out of uh you know the sanitary landfill i think uh is you know running out of course um you being from New Mexico you've probably been in to Washington especially if your your present location yes you must have come to Washington at least once yes i know not only have i come to Washington but um i find it very amusing that uh the thing that was just instituted here is very similar that is we also have blue bins we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and uh land fill space is indeed the driving factor here and in fact uh despite all of our open space out here land fill space is still um very hard to come by my you've got a lot a lot of nothing out there uh you know they got i mean there there's got to be a crevice between two mountains nobody gives a doggone about that you can you could use for landfill now ah but if somebody can make a regulation about it they will well what other uh well what uh what unique things you think uh that you can do about it in in what at Los Alamos uh other other than nuking it well um yes other than nuking it um in fact Los Alamos uh has uh done a fair amount of research uh in recycling things in general um it it involves for instance um creating biological organisms which can remove heavy elements like Selenium and barium and uh other things from uh waste material in general and um and purify the waste of specific uh uh nasty elements well isn't that uh that's uh that's pretty uh upscale uh trash uh uh situation i don't think anybody around here would understand all the all those exotic techniques you know getting rid of the heavy metals and the other thing that just was in the local news bulletin was somebody has uh made some special um polymers that have the ability to uh make certain Actinide elements adhere to them um uh they've uh looked at uh Plutonium and uranium and uh some other similar things to try to remove those from radio active waste hum and again this is driven by all of the documentation and uh E S and H uh uh considerations that uh people are uh worrying about i think much more than they should actually i've been involved in recycling for long before it became fashionable back when i was in graduate school i did all of the recycling of the um paper from the computer center and uh in fact i think i was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recyclable paper recycled paper hum well that certainly uh you know uh getting into the swim of things i i think it should be it it should go to the to the heart of the matter though and say okay guy you you everybody gets you know five pounds of garbage that they can throw away you know uh but more than that every week uh you've got to pay by the pound i think that's a wonderful idea i i i i think i think people would be would get very very you know they'd be very careful about how they bought stuff the only alternative i would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain uh if you did it by volume rather than by weight it would uh speak more directly to the space need than the land fill um-hum yeah and it would also cause people to compact their garbage more uh and uh and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight um-hum well of course that uh you know those big trucks can can probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor it looks like um we're going to have um a um sort of a third party movement on our hands in the fall yeah and uh i guess the last time that happen was uh well i guess it was Anderson in seventy two and then there was Wallace in sixty Anderson eighty or whenever it was yeah i remember remember Anderson but also a little a little young for that one i guess the what i see behind it this this this uh maybe it's always true of third party movements but this one seems to be almost entirely negative almost completely a reaction to uh um uh failure of the other two parties rather than anything positive that's uh represented yeah i that's a pretty good point i hadn't thought about it like that but yeah it's i guess it's not really um a start up with uh necessarily new ideas and you know this is my positive outlook but rather uh saying well uh i'm just not very happy with uh with the other two parties seem to be going type of thing yeah i think there's absolutely no political philosophy the only thing that uh Perot um seems to has to offer is that uh he's a doer yeah and since most people agree on what needs to be done but nobody can figure out how to do it he's just going to say uh i'm a CEO i know how to tell people to do things and get them done yeah which is uh pretty attractive and when uh Congress can't seem to be able to get anything done yeah i guess read a political cartoon uh must be probably about a week ago now or maybe you saw it i don't know how widespread this was but it showed uh Perot like revealing his you know what he stood for or whatever it's kind of like he had showed him open up his overcoat and open he open they drawed him um they drew him opening up his overcoat and inside was another overcoat uh-huh so it's like you know his he hasn't really he hasn't really said very much of what he stands for or what you know he's kind of pretty much vowed to saying you know i'll get i'll get this done and get that done you know but what is this and that type of thing yeah but well i think um it's it's a reaction to what's what's happened over the last ten or fifteen years where um the parties really just seem to be intent on blocking the other party from getting any further the the uh yeah the Democrats want to get the Republicans out of the White House and Republicans want to try to get control of Congress but they don't seem to have any really big ideas or sweeping um vision of where things should go yeah and now things are are so stalled that uh out of uh pure frustration comes along with uh uh a guy who says he can get things done yeah so maybe he is part of a um a more general trend in politics over the last twenty years the um uh i don't know those of us who weren't too happy with the Reagan years saw that as a as just a um of selfishness and um yeah government just got out of the way there wasn't no prevailing philosophy except do what you can to get you something for yourself yeah it it it seems it seems as though that that's definitely definitely a point of the two parties pretty much trying to block each other and there's been a definite i'd say definite loss in actual you know ideals and there's just there's too much each side you know where there's Republican or Democrat both of them like trying to um you know either play to the hands of like what the dominant philosophy is uh not not not not dominant but like old style philosophy of each each um in each party and not really coming up with a new ideas or the or maybe i mean it it you know it's time for maybe a definite new vision and and what's going on which may be you know a blend of both you know maybe both parties or you know a little bit of this a little bit of that which may not fall into the lines of either party but you know just doesn't seem as though either party wants to do very much that rocks the boat or maybe maybe says oh its time for a little bit of you know um yeah things aren't going very well oh in the big picture maybe right now Congress getting better or it's maybe it's getting worse or who knows but you know it's just like a little ripple in the ocean it's know some some somebody got to look down the road a ways and say well what's going to go on yeah what yeah what i see is all tactics and no strategy um that and uh yeah yeah it's i mean it's fun to watch on a day by day basis but it doesn't get anything done in the long run right right if all you're interested in is making the other guy look bad and making yourself look good you don't really accomplish anything right yeah in the long run the infrastructure deteriorates and people kind of lose their uh sense of a of purpose yeah yeah i take that definitely yeah do you have a particular opinion on it i'm a little uh i'm a not i i think that that i do i i'm not sure that uh that i think it should be like a normal practice all the time i think there are certain circumstances where it's important but it it kind of touches on on on privacy and so you know i i have kind of a a feeling that that it's a little invasive but then again on the other hand you have to stop and realize that um a lot of people are are uh are are trapped in that in that addiction thing you know and it's bad for them but that's not necessarily gonna mean that they're gonna get the help they need and and get cured or anything you know and some jobs uh uh require you to be straight and with it to do a good job and protect yourself and and things like that too you know so how you think how you feel well well i'm kind of ambivalent also you like you say it it does affect your privacy um i guess i how i could cope with it i do think in some cases it does make sense and how i could cope with it was um if when you accepted a job they told you up front this is part of it you know then it's like porn movie you have the choice you know nobody sticks it in your face you've got the choice if you don't wanna deal with it don't take the job right there you go that's right um there are certain jobs in which i'd be more likely to feel comfortable about it and and those are the jobs in which a person's performance could affect your life um-hum certainly uh someone who carries a gun um-hum um there's been a lot of publicity um in New York on Long Island where um there's been school bus drivers who have driven erratically and caused accidents and killed kids because they were wow uh on drugs and things yeah and where your actions could affect somebody's life i'd be much more accepting of drug testing but under no circumstances would i think that you could just go take a job and they could say hey guess what you know we're gonna do this right i i think it has to be up front and then you've got the choice of not doing it yeah well well the problem there is that you know a lot of people that have worked for the same company for so long um that company decides well if we're going to hire new people you know well we're going to have to start checking it because we've had a problem in the past well their problem in the past is with past employees and so the new people are saying well if you know i i am sure this could happen you know if you're gonna if you're gonna um test us you should be testing the old people too and so they get into a to a discrimination problem probably or something like that well yeah i imagine it would be just this is new company policy and we're doing it to everybody yeah in which case hey you know you don't like it you can go look for another job but of course that's not so easy you know um see there's one of the big problems people are are in that situation they need that job right um and uh then they have the choice of either take the test or don't get the or or don't take the job and if they know they're going to fail the test you know they're kind of in a in a between a rock and a hard place there so it's uh kind of like i took a i'm i'm a licensed art teacher and i substitute which is why i'm home today i'm not working i'm not working oh really lucky you well you know i'm home a little too often i think they're they're not calling substitutes that often but at any rate um i had taken a state test to be of all things a court officer uh-huh uh my mom had worked for the state and she thought this was a brilliant idea so i just went along with it i thought it'd be neat you know like a James Bond woman with a gun and all this and part of the um you know you take this test i did very well and they called me in for a physical and part of it was a test for drugs nobody asked me you know they didn't mention what they were doing but it was perfectly obvious and i you know all government people and all army people are just tested right and there was one fellow who just kept horsing around he he seemed almost you know a little crazy but he wouldn't you know give a urine sample and it was pretty obvious why you know he's just like oh i can't do it i can't do it you know and this went on for hours i was wondering why he didn't just leave you know if you're not going to do it just leave he was gonna fail right because you're not gonna get the job if you don't it was it was almost comical um in my case they didn't follow me in the bathroom but apparently they were following you know the more suspicious types into the bathroom yeah you know because apparently people i i read somewhere that you can replace your urine with ginger with warm Sprite or something Mountain Dew and it tests you know that it tests like urine and you know it tests okay obviously huh i don't know i've heard people using somebody elses uh-huh yeah you know i mean i guess if there i guess there is something to be worried about if there's a whole science of knowing how to deal with the test you you know smuggle it in um making a whole new element of society out there yeah i don't know you know um like i don't uh i don't use drugs you know but um i know people who do i don't think why don't you start this time okay uh let's see i have a Macintosh 2CI and uh i'm a graduate student in cognitive psychology uh and so i use it basically to run all my statistics and write up my reports and research and all that kind of good stuff and i'd be dead without it yeah i'm in the same position i started on a Commodore in nineteen eighty six um and moved up in eighty eight to an IBM system and i'm running on an IBM clone right now under windows which basically is the same thing i think um-hum and uh i've used it also i do tremendous amounts of word processing i work in radio but i'm required to do a lot of you know journalistic writing and that hm um-hum uh so i do almost everything now in Word or in some other you know word processing system and uh use it to gather news and information and put it all together for something that's usable so i've had my computer i've i i've found what's happened is that i can't write anymore on paper you know because i type so fast now that any it's distracting to try and write by hand because it takes too long exactly exactly and then i like to like go back and re-edit things as soon as i write it and and you know you can't do that very well with uh a piece of paper and a pencil you know cause it takes so much longer to change things around and and move whole chunks and all this that and the other oh yeah and of course you know i also run a bulletin board from here and i'm involved in FidoNet hm oh okay uh i'm the i'm the net coordinator up here for western and central New York oh wow uh part of Net 260 here it's got we have eighty nodes in this city alone wow so we try we try and get everybody together and that way it you know you can exchange mail between them and you don't have to call them um-hum right and i just got into the we FidoNet's now has a thing where we can get in with the internet so i found out uh-huh yeah i've started seeing some uh internet postings from FidoNet and stuff like that yeah i it's where i found out about this through Comp DCom Telecom yeah yeah uh and i submit some messages on there i it's made things so so much easier it's amazing though that in nineteen eighty six we were all doing like three hundred bawd um-hum and of course you know now that's like ancient history and you think my God it was only like five six years ago yep yep and then here's what we have now i mean what's in five years from now it's just unimaginable what we're going to be able to do with these things yeah yeah well you know if we ever get any sort of uh ISDN running nationally it'll be really incredible hm if they have the amount of data we can exchange well that's good Gore's working on right yeah well that and he's talking about expanding the the internet as it stands now upgrading the backbone stuff like that yeah uh so you know it's going to kind of impact everybody everywhere well i see the phone companies are working on getting into information services so we're going to have a glut of things everyone i think we're going to see another revolution in um-hum computers but i think the reason why it didn't work the first time is that they assumed that everybody would need a computer to do all these things uh when in fact at the time you know back in the early eighties uh and mid eighties you know people didn't the technology wasn't to the point where it was something that could be easily learned for everyone but now we have the things like the Mac and Windows and other things where all you got to do is point at something and push a button um-hum oh yeah and i think that the technology's catching up to the point where we're going to be able to do things and make it a lot easier to for people to understand how to do these things um-hum so i'm hoping that we will see another type of revolution but one that will be a little more friendly to the end user yeah yeah um i think what's going to happen is it's going to sneak into the consumer market uh through the television and through the cable industry and telephone industry um-hum um i was just reading in the Washington Post this morning they've got an article in the business section uh about how AT&T has just announced that they plan to offer uh cable TV systems with five hundred channels by nineteen ninety four uh you know well they're working on that i'm a satellite dish owner and we've been fighting like mad to have these suckers re-regulated you know because of the uh because they've stomped on us yeah and so now what's happening is the phone companies want to get into cable and introduce all these kinds of computer services over fiber optics um-hum and the cable industry now wants to get into the telephone industry through these personal communication things right um-hum but i think everyone's working now i i mean i'm seeing this we're going to see a lot more in the way of keyboards with electronic program guides and and everything else and ordering systems they have this thing called TV um-hum an interesting topic yes the uh type of cars that i was uh uh i would probably be most interested in if i was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a uh Mazda Miata uh-huh uh the uh i'm very much uh a fan of sports cars ah boy you and my husband would have a whole lot in common the uh yeah the um uh though actually in some actually if i have i have avoided i've avoided buying a new car for quite some time i'd rather put my money into restoring my old cars i have a old Triumph TR Six uh-huh and uh uh so uh but if i was to buy one probably something like a Miata it's certainly it i wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time yeah oh really what's the how old is your car uh well i have a i have a nineteen eighty five uh eighty five CRX oh uh which is you know it's it still works fine but it's it's actually it's kind of annoying cause i've got no reason to to replace it but uh yeah right oh yeah so what do the Miatas run oh those are they're about uh uh thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and you know a bit more if you add some some options and so on but well that's not too bad the uh yeah that's a pretty good price and they're they're they're they're so so nice to drive uh yeah really i've never driven one uh it's it's it's nice they're uh i've been down to a dealer and driven them and i've also driven one at a something Mazda put on where uh they went to uh auto cross events across the country uh which is where you race in uh you you race on in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of uh cones to see who can get through them fastest oh uh yeah about a minute or so and uh very twisty stuff and oh it handles so nicely uh-huh and so you've done this oh okay oh yeah yeah it was just it it it's just so smooth and yeah nice car really what are you interested in whatever my husband buys you don't you you don't get involved in uh car decisions oh not too much no we um we just got rid of a full conversion van that that i i it that wasn't me that was my husband he wanted the van and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there T V you know the whole bit but i never drove it so it just it wasn't me you know yeah i can understand well would you want if you had to decide what would you want and then oh i'd want a minivan because i'm with the kids all the time yeah yeah and okay yeah they're nice oh yeah that's perfect for that it's not it it's small enough that it's easy to drive yeah you pick up i pick up my little one from preschool and the whole parking lot's full of minivans but you know i i drive a little Subaru holds a lot yeah yeah and uh we i love that uh we were going to trade that in for the van but i just wanted to hold on to that because i just really enjoy that right and um that's really all i needed was for something just to go here and there and back yeah uh minivans are nice i have a friend who has a minivan and uh i've driven it a few times and uh it's nice it's nice of course uh-huh you know my family my family has always had cars like that uh in that yeah my father has had a had a always had a VW bus every since uh nineteen about nineteen sixty or so oh really oh really uh i they he he uses he often has to transport plants or uh things like that cause he's he goes to orchid shows and and you know fills fills the car with plants and so on or yeah yeah it's amazing what a minivan can do we went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan and pulled uh um the little trailer behind the pop up trailer and uh it's so it's really amazing how much a minivan can can you know what it can do um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah and they're not that expensive no they're not yeah they probably we probably mainly because everyone makes them you know you can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be yeah yeah and we we do a lot of um driving we do a lot of traveling by car and so that's the only time that the that the uh conversion van came in handy but it really didn't cause our our kids are still little hum um-hum so um that was the only time we really needed it other than that it got terrible mileage and yeah yeah Minivans do do pretty well yeah you know twenty twenty twenty five miles per gallon or more yeah some of them probably even do thirty yeah the uh yeah there there's some other cars i'd like but i uh uh i would never be willing to spend quite that much money for uh like uh uh i'll drool over them i don't really know any elderly uh in uh no i hello homes or anything care of the elderly i guess is yeah i haven't given much thought to it i'm kind of busy raising my kids the only way i can relate to it is i think of my mother taking care of her parents yeah and i remember her running over there every morning to make sure they got dressed and and and fed and cleaned and uh i remember her saying to me i hope don't ever let me do that to you put me in a home because it's it's hellish on the person who has to give the care to a person like that you know these they have uh around here they've got these uh they're like uh condos um-hum uh complexes and they're uh oh for senior citizens geared to elderly and senior citizens and they have i think uh like a nurse on staff there well i don't think yeah i don't think the problem is i mean those condos are like elderly people just living in their own apartments i think the trouble begins when they have more physical problems and they take care of some of that kind of thing um-hum i mean it's got to be humiliating to have a stranger a nurse or somebody lift you in and out of a bathtub yeah you know because i mean i'm i'm not aged but i'm i'm forty one now and i still feel twenty something and i realize that my body is kind of traitorous and and and changing on me even though i'm not feeling terribly old yeah so i can imagine you you know being eighty and somebody has to dress you and you're probably sitting there thinking my God this is so degrading but your body just won't do it yeah well i don't know i don't i'm not sure that uh this is necessarily true during even if they're eighty you know because you can a lot of people uh maintain their their uh fitness and so forth right on up well i i think nowadays people are making that effort to eat right and to be more fit and i think old age is getting older yeah that's a definitely uh that's statistically true hum are your parents alive and my dad's eighty five i think right now eighty five do and he fends totally for himself yep that's wonderful he still yeah he was having a little trouble getting his driver's license he lives down in Florida where i was raised but uh that's great that looks good for you too you know longevity in the family yeah right yeah and my grandmother was lived to a pretty ripe old age too of course she was in a home when she lost you know her her mind went my dad's is still pretty you know pretty well with it well i you know my thought is if your mind goes at the same rate your body goes then nobody cares right you know it's like animals when they're stupid what the hell do they know i think if one goes before the other is when you run into trouble yeah right i guess yeah well that like that uh what is it uh that disease of the Alzheimer's yeah oh that'd be awful well i i think it that kind of thing is probably awful for everybody around you i think these people don't rightly know what they're doing yeah yeah really yeah it's hard to say yeah that's true i had a friend that got that and he was fairly young i think he was in his like late thirties or forties or something like that well is that something that is that something that affects you all the time or do you kind of like wave in and wave out of it uh maybe a little lower i don't know i think it does come and go to some extent but it just keeps continually getting worse yeah um that doesn't doesn't sound too pleasant no it isn't well well i you know i talking about what would you look for if you had to put someone in a home i guess uh i don't know i guess a place that has the most activities you know keeping your mind alive even if you couldn't do very much um-hum you'd have to go uh i guess you'd have to go kind try and pay them surprise visits and see if you could tell what the atmosphere was like and so forth yeah that's that's true if they were uh you know seemed to be caring or whether they were just warehousing them yeah there's a lot of them like that i'm afraid well you know you nobody takes care of your own as well as you would i was brought up in in a city where everybody lived in apartment buildings and there wasn't any room to you know wasn't houses there wasn't a room to take in the elderly um-hum yeah so if and when they couldn't take care of themselves they couldn't move in with you because you had a three room apartment or something so you know that's why they went somewhere else where in the city uh you know my life's changed now i only i kind of think the probably the biggest political topic that i can think of at this point is probably the Ross Perot uh candidacy uh i think that that has some interesting uh effects to it at this point with the uh um-hum level of um uh outrage outrage that the public seems to have the voting public seems to have with the existing candidates out there and i think that uh that is certainly something that we haven't seen to this level before right well they've been independent candidates before but uh never as as as popular as he seems to be and i mean it seems to be um doesn't really matter who who it is it's just that fact that he's not in either party that uh seems to be why he's so popular i guess what's your view on big political issues hm um well if we i i i mean sticking with this topic um i would just say that you know it's it's interesting that it doesn't really seem to matter what um what his views are you know i mean he seems to have some views which are pretty conservative and which are pretty liberal um-hum um but it it seems like people are more interested in just the fact that he's an alternative you know than to um to what what you know it i i guess he hasn't really outlined a platform yet you know and people keep asking him you know what what do you feel uh is the best a plan to deal with the budget or blah blah blah yeah and um he really doesn't have any answers i guess but that doesn't stop his popularity from swelling you know people are just sick and tired of um everyone else i guess it seems to be i don't know it's kind of like um people always people always blame you know they always say how can uh-oh dogs outside um people always say how how can these politicians be in power and stuff but i guess they forget that they're the ones who put them there in the first place you know they're always they're always trying to find third third alternatives like um you know uh limiting limiting number of years in office for instance but you know all they have to do is vote him out of office you know it's almost like they want to be forced to vote the way that they could in any case you know what i mean yeah it seems strange it's it's going to be interesting to see if he uh actually you know we hear the complaints about uh voter apathy and and the whole the whole shebang about throw the bums out right it and it it usually you know it's a big deal until election day comes around and then it you know it fizzles out and we end up with the same people exactly and uh you have to wonder whether is this going to be something that uh is really going to result in hm um a mass turnout of the current people that we have in there or whether this is just going to be another of the same old well throw the bums out but not my bum you know right right as long as he brings pork back my state then um what what do you think his chances are what do you think uh how much of the vote do you think he's going to get and do you think he will take it more from the Republicans or the Democrats well the media media keeps saying that he's supposed to drain it away from the Democrats but i know that there's a lot of Democrats that don't like Bill Clinton um-hum um-hum uh-huh i'm one of them i'm not happy with Bill Clinton at all uh but i you know i'm concerned more concerned about Democrats saying they're unhappy with Bill Clinton and then they go and vote for Ross Perot and then we basically split any protest vote against against Bush more or less in half you know i mean you're dividing it too far and then he squeaks by for four more years and you know for me that's not a going to be a wonderful uh feeling exactly right exactly but uh i think it'll be interesting to see um whether it turns out he gets more than twenty percent of the vote if that um i um-hum personally i have a i have a problem with with electing someone who's that rich um i mean they're all that rich anyway but but someone who's advertised as that rich i don't know i it i kind of um have problems seeing what he and i would have in common you know yeah but i you know it'll be interesting i i don't i agree that i don't think that okay uh mandatory service yeah i don't think it's a good idea uh because we'd have to change the Constitution to to uh allow uh involuntary servitude uh in service to the government and i'm not sure that we could do that in such a way that we could avoid winding up a slave state uh-huh it's i like the idea and in what way are you talking about well i like the idea of voluntary voluntary support i mean they might be able to ah say that anyone who does that uh gets certain benefits that would not be available to someone who didn't do it right but to use force um really sets us a a it it essentially says that your body there's a title to your body and that title belongs to the government and you are not a free American citizen right yeah right the idea itself of service is good and when someone is say out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they're not committed to huge amounts of debt that's the best time to be able to do work that doesn't pay very well see i i yeah and i also thought that um that would interfere with with college work and yeah unless it were tied directly they didn't yeah you know if someone were studying something uh let's say take something obscure somebody was studying economics the State Department could offer to send them to the Soviet Union for two years to teach them how to run their country yeah that's true as an extreme example right yeah but in reality i think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use to for their own will and i just don't think it would work when do they assume this is gonna be proposed or mandatory or when when i what what year are they looking at well they're not it's been suggested and it's sort of a topic of debate every time it comes up it gets voted down the uh people who are pro-military oppose it because they don't want people to have the right to opt out of the military into something else uh-huh um-hum yeah and the people who are pro-constitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the United States is actually under attack yeah right so mostly it's just kind of one of those things that goes away ah they've got a noisy line right yeah i thought that was your line yeah well it's somewhere between here and there uh what age group is are are they looking at uh oh eighteen the draft age yeah wait a minute yeah let me see if i can get on a cleaner line if it's my line um eighteen yeah that seems normally that would interfere with college i would think i moved maybe that is that's part of it yeah it is my line i was on a radio phone oh all right that's better yeah no there they they figure that they can draft you at eighteen age they usually do draft you at nineteen and that's the age they're looking at oh hm and of course they're this one the women would be equally grabbed and they're almost on the verge of saying that you if you're gonna draft men you're gonna have to draft women and you're gonna have to put them in front of the guns just the same right so uh if you're near that age or you know somebody who is uh you know be aware of that um-hum yeah well that's kind of scary i'm not near that age i'm way over it but i do have children to think about you know yeah oh okay yep and you don't want them sent off to the Middle East to help defend Bush from Saddam after Bush gets done arming him that's kind of scary right you know we only find out about that a year after the fact yeah so it's another thing when in doubt don't trust the government at all it's really reached that point oh uh-huh hm hey you're in Perot country i'm really thinking that this guy might be good for us i do too i've been it it seemed dangerous i thought is the guy a closet fascist and then i find out that he helped rid the United States of the Gablers he's he's helped out in a lot of ways yeah he's he's from Dallas or he's in the Dallas area and uh he's very well known around here so yeah well i'm in the computer biz too so i know he's well known in the industry they uh i i have high hopes for him and i think that you know if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us then i'm for him uh-huh yeah i i i mean in the Democratic primary i'm gonna vote for Brown just because i kind of like Brown and his attitude but when uh when it really comes down in the fall i think i know where it's gonna go yeah yeah i i think he's got a very good chance so there's a lot of people here pulling for him um-hum so i don't know we'll just see how did you uh you work in the um computer business that what you said yeah you know this yeah i'm an end user i teach people how to use Macintoshes and how to buy equipment and desktop publishing magazine production and things related to that oh okay well my husband works for um Texas Instruments and so um that's how we found out about the Switchboard uh-huh oh yeah oh that's their project too isn't it i found about it on the network well my exercise program consists of uh you know it's it's a it's an opportunity to stay alive really hm instead of wasting you know wasting my my you know the the trying to exist on the latency of my youth and the good health of my youth and it what i like to do is i like to stretch out and i like to run uh my i'm like to run get my heartbeat up i like to run about oh about two two and a half miles and then i like to work out on uh on the uh uh the Bailey Life Cycle uh Cycle machines up here at the at at the Holiday Spa and and and i i think that you know i've had a regimen now for about you know ten fifteen years of of doing that and uh and you know i kind of think it's uh it's a lot of work but i think it's uh it's the uh you know the the amount of effort that's required to uh to stay healthy you know i have a sedentary job and uh unless you do something like that you know you're going to get sick right yeah i'm i need to get i'm i'm i'm pretty bad about that i'm lazy i should i know i want i always say that i need to get running start running and i going to try and do that this summer because i never have time i i always put it off by the time i get back from classes it's late at night and i don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever because i i'm i'm getting a gut here i got to get get back into shape well i uh two years ago i started having trouble with my knee and uh you know i've got a you know i figured well it'll go away well i started you know i'm i've had to reduce my program reduce my program and i've gained fifteen pounds hm and so uh you know it's you you know i need to get back into swimming you know instead instead of running if i can't swim or i can't run i should be able to swim well i'm such a terrible swimmer and i i i really feel i can i can dedicate about an hour an hour and fifteen minutes for to this effort but if it gets longer than that i i it it i start not doing anything yeah and so i i got a real problem in that regard uh it do you you obviously are are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it yeah i mean it i do it i guess i'm going to do it um because i want to get in shape i'm not it's not something i really enjoy all that much although i'll i'll i'll probably i mean once i get into it and i if i if i get into better shape then it'll be it won't be as much of a a chore to me well it's it's always a chore i i mean i started doing this when i was about thirty five and now i'm fifty five yeah hm yeah and uh you know i i know that in i just know that i'm going to get blown away with some some piece of nonsense you you know some health related thing is going to blow me away that's same way i got too much weight on right now right i need to lose fifty pounds you know i need to lose at least twenty you know but uh you know it's it's just uh i'm busy i'm doing a lot of traveling and uh it it creates a problem uh you know when you're on the road what sort of uh uh what what what other programs other than say running have you have you ever done anything at all yeah i have um sit-ups or also also last summer i was doing Nautilus or last year i um belong to a club around here got kind of expensive uh to renew to renew renew they wanted another fifty dollars that was a little bit too much money but um doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights um-hum well what club what club are you with i like that i'm sorry what club were you with uh it's called oh what was it called City Sports downtown Washington huh okay so you're you're down you're downtown yeah i'm at i'm at i go to George Washington University okay yeah you're down there on you know twentieth and eighteenth and yeah F G it's uh Plaza oh well i'd uh well there's a there's a Holiday Spa down there on on K street i think something like that but uh i i go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria and that's pretty good but you know evening time it gets pretty busy but generally you know i can i can get in and get a program in right but uh you know i i need to i need to rededicate myself to uh to doing this and uh i got a problem uh you know ever since my knee went bad of getting back solidly into it i mean i've been doing this for fifteen twenty years yeah and you know and i'm i know i'm going to get i know it's going to bite me in the ass so i i really don't want to want to uh you know back off on it yeah it's something i it's like uh i'm young and i should get started getting into shape i don't want to at one i mean one point it's going to be too late to do it like well no when you're young you you can abuse your your all your systems and you can recover yeah uh when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems you get blown away hm and just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye you know and uh and so the object of the game why don't you start oh i don't know i um i refinished a couple of old uh dressers that were given handed down you know it's nice tongue and groove um uh construction uh huh that's just i've been pretty successful with that things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that what are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that refinishing no i've done some other things too um you know i've yeah i've done both uh i have had my wife's picked up a couple things saying uh boy if we could refinish that that'd be a beautiful piece of furniture and uh and we've done it a couple of times yeah i guess that we've been fairly successful with those that's uh that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it i guess oh yeah yeah that's a good way to get started um i have a a um really nice desk a nicer desk than i could afford which i got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh liberated it after a fire and uh um-hum we stripped it all the way down and refinished it it turned out to be really nice uh pretty nice desk maple top i think or um-hum um-hum or something of that sort yeah i i put together um a um rolltop desk from scratch you know a kit oh really oh i'm jealous still had to cut it and everything but yeah it's fun uh-huh yeah i've i do do things uh that might be too crude to be called woodworking i've built my own deck and uh-huh um things like that yeah i've i've done the same you know like the trim around the house you know the baseboards and things like that and i i definitely have begun to accumulate tools too my i uh i picked up a bunch of Craftsman tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive and so i do have a band saw and a router and um things like that out in the garage but i can't say i use them very often uh-huh um i i'm looking at trying to get a router right now they're handy uh they they come in handy at the most unusual times putting doors in is the time when i'm uh i bought myself a um template for making mortices and doors and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel but i've also i've also used them for building drawers where you uh for rabbeting and uh i'll bet because uh rabbeting on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain um-hum so i got one for Christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months i had it and now i i use it twice a year maybe yeah my brothers my brothers used it a lot for making drawers the big stuff i don't know what what's your opinion of what a good router is like uh i guess it you know i had because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great they've plastic parts and stuff the ones that what that you dial in on the side uh i have never even seen i've never even looked at one closely and the the little use that i've gotten from my router i would say um-hum uh i would spend my money on the bits uh-huh um i have a i'd guess you'd call a medium quality Craftsman router and the um how strong is it it's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three eighths of an inch at a time but the problem is that the uh as with any any time you buy um a a tool with as as as a as a package the bits that they give you are low end don't they um-hum um-hum so the price of a good set of uh carbide steel uh bits is probably um i mean a a good set of bits is probably gonna run you a hundred dollars and uh um if you're gonna use it for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it because um imagine if i go and sharpen them myself uh it won't last and i've never had the bits sharpened uh-huh so that's a thing to consider is to they they really get hot don't they yeah and they they dull after a while especially i did some cabinets in um ash and oak and uh that that wears a bit down uh-huh we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh which had been in the original remodeling of our kitchen uh-huh right and i saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth and uh routing hardwood will um take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast so yeah i've cut some one by eight oak before boy was that fun big solid pieces of oak are just tough right that's uh and then you take the blade to the to get sharpened right well that was you know with a with a circular saw like oh my gosh this gonna be fun uh-huh right yeah well i've used mine on treated wood and now all my blades need sharpening yeah because uh the treated wood will also chew them up yeah treated wood can really make you sick too if you're not okay okay Carol so air quality yeah is it i know in here uh downtown Dallas it's you i mean you drive by and you can just you can see it but then again i was originally was from California and uh there is a big difference between Texas and California uh-huh surely and uh they'd have their smog alerts and where you'd have to stay indoors for so many hours with an air conditioner and of course they don't have that here in Texas so there's you mean they don't have the uh the smog alerts no not in not in Texas not well not in Dallas that is right i i yeah i spent a summer in in in Tyler so i know just east of Dallas there yeah we're going there tomorrow uh-huh we're packing and getting ready to go to oh really yeah actually i'm a California born person uh-huh i was born in LA so i know what you're talking about in LA it's pretty bad yeah oh okay yeah you do then um the worst city in the in the world is actually uh Mexico City is it really i would not imagine that yes the worst one for smog is Mexico City huh the most polluted city in the world huh you learn something every day is that crazy yeah i know that they've they're looking at uh um you know uh you know better running automobiles uh-huh yeah i've seen that um some things they do one one one one of them is they're using corn in fuel huh i huh-uh you ever heard of that yeah Methanol huh no yeah well that's big up here because of the they grow a lot of corn oh yeah yeah uh yeah that's one thing that they do and at at that it's pretty easy to do and the uh uh-huh unfortunately it still contributes to global warming cause you have to wipe you know wipe out forest to grow corn and things like that it doesn't make sense yeah that's true uh but it's you know one of the most uh productive crop in the world is corn right huh and of course i doubt if there's any you can buy regular anymore you buy unleaded right yeah yeah huh drive cars with catalytic converters and all that it's interesting they're they're looking at at there's some work being done on uh automobiles that are electric powered uh-huh and uh they're looking at where you have a battery operated car basically but it has a a engine in the back that charges it so the engine kicks on when the batteries need power and it turns off uh-huh uh-huh interesting thing about gas is when i mean about battery powered cars is when you're at a stop light you're not using energy any energy huh that is good unlike a car where it's running yeah electric car it's on demand i mean it's either on or off basically yeah huh you don't have to shift so you cars become very simple all of a sudden too oh oh very interesting that would be nice i think i saw that on TV one time they maybe it was CNN where they were demonstrating that or something similar to that yeah there's a there's a race in Australia with solar powered cars oh and Ford and General Motors and all those compete but what what what i think that was a setback a a setback that they i don't know they went i don't know how many miles an hour i think like twenty right was was that something maybe it was i don't know yeah GM uh Chrysler announced that they're going to they're well they actually have an electric minivan oh yeah their their Caravan huh but it costs uh fifty thousand dollars right now yeah and they're they're very expensive too i was gonna to operate yeah but you know people are buying them you know whose buying them the power company free you know free for them well yeah yeah kind of interesting so see well it doesn't make sense because if they want people to convert you know uh-huh they should make it worthwhile yeah it's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour so it's a good good vehicle yeah yeah hum well i'll tell you sometimes it's it's pretty bad here today like today i think it was pretty bad i don't know if it was if it's just uh allergies or what but uh-huh some days it's really it's very nice here downtown and other days it's just really bad so i don't know so what what kind of things did you experience in LA when you were there or can you remember were you there at a oh i wasn't there too long ago um cause i haven't been there probably well you know you going over the hills you know coming into the valley you can see that horrible horrible brown haze yeah well we were there when they had a
