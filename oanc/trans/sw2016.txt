 card yourself or uh yes uh uh not as much as i used to we used to have quite a few credit cards and over the the last few years we've tried to cut them back a little bit and and uh down to mainly mainly one each uh um-hum yeah uh it's it's easy to let them get out of control yeah it's i work at a at a financial institution and seen quite a bit used to be a loan officer and seen people with you know they've had well i've seen a person with forty thousand dollars in limits and about twenty thousand dollars of it used and i and we we've got one but it's just for absolute emergencies we hardly ever use it oh yeah yeah that's uh that's what we try to to go to uh and eliminate all the uh uh department store uh credit cards uh got rid of all those yeah for sure yeah they uh they can like you say you can once you start using them they they're always real real willing to raise those limits for you that's for sure yes they they uh they used to be uh uh more credit conscious i think the credit card companies now with with interest rates as high as they are they don't have to be as credit conscious they can um-hum no they can afford to write off a lot more yeah they can write off a lot more losses now um-hum uh which which i kind of disagree uh with i'd rather them going back to being a little bit more credit conscious and and lower the rates yeah that's excuse me yeah that's true i uh well i can't see why people if they shop around you can find uh you know thirteen fourteen percent rates without any problem i can't imagine why anyone would even think about paying nineteen you know because there's yeah i i've heard though that the ones who are offering the lower rates uh do have tougher credit checks and than the ones with the higher rates have yeah well that make you you know that makes sense i guess if they're they're not willing to write off as much but yeah you know it there's a lot of people you know i that uh you know you receive all those ones in the mail and it just seems like well we sent we'll take it just because they sent it to me and then they get charged fifty dollars cost or a year for the just the fee and everything it yeah i don't know i just i have a hard time i like i say i working in a financial institution i just i'm really rate conscious i guess and can't see paying you know hardly or near that much twenty one percent gets pretty crazy yeah well yeah well well people people shop real heavily for when they for savings accounts and everything else to get that extra percent or two and then they don't look at at spending uh eighteen percent on on credit it's uh for some reason they don't look at it that way um-hum yeah yep there's i imagine there's there's quite a few people who just pay it off monthly so they don't have to charge you know get get charged any but it seems like the people that can least afford it are the ones of course that can't pay it off monthly and get that that's that's true we we have tried uh in the last couple years to to do just that and use them for convenience and pay them off but there's um-hum sometimes around Christmas and times like that we sometimes charge up a bit and takes a couple months to pay them off but yeah yeah that's true but the people who who can't afford it uh they really get caught up in in the minimum payment and the interest rate it it's sort of like the federal government um-hum yeah exactly that's true but yeah i uh i i think that would do the whole country a lot of good is a lot of you know consumers paying down some of that debt they've got it just seems like they're they right now they can't afford to buy anymore because they're up to the limits in debt and and everything and so you know that's part of the reason i think everything's kind of stalled out but yes that's right well the credit card companies i know are arguing against uh being forced to lower their rates but uh um-hum uh i think it would only mean that they'd they'd have to go back and and toughen their requirements a a bit and they'd probably make just as much money they just wouldn't write off as many losses yeah that exactly you know when that thing was they were trying to pass through through that through Congress they the thing that Congress didn't realize is that yeah they would just shut off all the people that were marginal and you know it would slow you know they were trying to pick things up but it would just it do wouldn't do any good because you know the banks aren't stupid they're going to realize that they can't you know they can't keep affording to write off five percent if they're only charging you know thirteen fourteen percent yeah that's that's right yes uh well like in like in any business they uh the same thing happened to banks you know they didn't look at uh the credit worthiness of making a lot of loans either and that's in uh in real estate and other things and it's the same with credit cards um-hum that's true that's true i don't know what will happen like i say we're sure trying we we just got the one and we just don't want to get any more yeah we i i use a company one somewhat uh uh to to uh no do air travel and all but uh i make sure that one's always uh paid off because i'm responsible for the interest on that one if if i don't pay it off uh uh um-hum yeah if it's not huh huh where do you work at i work for uh an oil company and they they issue a an American Express card so that you don't have to ask for uh expense advances when you have to travel and buy air tickets so oh do you um-hum um uh yeah so you just use your card but it's but it's in your name so it's up to you to pay it off and and because it's American Express you can't run up a a credit on it so that turn in the voucher um  well got any problems on Mockingbird with crime or is that a crime free zone there no i don't think there is any such thing as a crime free zone any longer uh i'm afraid you're right uh one evening i decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought oh well something's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house oh my and they had stopped a uh a stolen car oh boy and caught one of the men in the hedge and then the other one was on the roof in the back by your house by on my house oh my goodness ah aye aye so i'm very much aware of uh crime in the cities and the and the concern about it oh my that's that's got to be a frightening way to spend spend an evening it was i uh i kept hearing noises and so i i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage so i got a gun my gun and walked to the you know through the house into the garage there was no one there but i wanted to be sure oh boy is Plano beginning to experience the the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan you know in the urban area unfortunately yes yes that's too bad i think uh you know as any city grows up uh you get the hoods and the ruf riffraff and everybody else in there and i think u um-hum um-hum you know fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek but uh we've been we've lived here sixteen years and um-hum now you you know you can tell the change for sure well i was thinking if you've been there that long you've seen Plano grow from what was really a a small town to a city yes well with all the uh Central Expressway uh with all the stores and the uh restaurants and the um-hum uh convenience stores and all that kind of stuff it's just prime pickings for people driving by you know and yeah well i was appalled to read the other day about the uh uh shooting on the tollway that's that couldn't be too far from you neither uh uh well it's further west of me okay i live over near White Rock Lake oh yes okay but uh uh it was really frightening to think that uh it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway or for those people in the tollbooth uh i never thought about someone robbing those but apparently they do i don't know uh how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody but yeah it just doesn't seem possible does it it's kind of kind of stupid isn't it um-hum but i guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time it's looks like easy pickings and away you go right no yeah and i think the drugs play a tremendous part in um the theft and the the violence that we see i think you're right uh although i think that may be an excuse for people too it it is convenient isn't it i didn't know what i was doing right right right just like the old alcohol idea and that kind of um-hum i think people uh i think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money um-hum well yes and i work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System and uh uh uh do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are oh boy where do you work uh yes i think i do that uh is that Amelia Earhout Earhart School there uh no this is over near Lincoln High School okay uh just not far off South Central Expressway that's a pretty rough area there isn't it it is a pretty rough area we're over by Fair Park um my goodness and uh you know you watch the people there are marvelous BMW's and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns huh and the kids see that and uh they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where uh you know running for uh drug dealers if definitely that area that that's big time big time there sure is um-hum it surely is i don't think i'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself in that area well i'm careful gee that's the worst neighborhood in the whole city area yeah it's uh a little scary sometimes and uh i manage the  Mike i'm calling from Dallas from Richardson oh okay great i'm in Addison here okay well good you know our subject is on boating and sailing right and quite honestly with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat i have never really got into sailing or boating i do uh quite a bit of sailing i own a sailboat that i keep parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop and we take it out and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts but oh do you well great well that's neat i haven't really been taking it out recreationally too much lately since it's i don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore so it's hard for me to get it somewhere but right i've seen some nice nice sailboats the guy that used to live next to us in Richardson before we moved twelve years ago or whatever he had a sailboat used to park it right in the uh driveway and it seemed i think it held probably uh it must have slept four people anyway yeah this one is not that big it's a day sailer it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of right stuck your body out the whole it back into the main part of the sailboat but i i understand but it's there they can be black holes to throw money into boats are kind of expensive to maintain i'll tell you it's oh they are and you know we have a swimming pool at our house and i think of all the time now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever that i put in there i just could not imagine a boat because i know it's a lot of maintenance especially a bigger one the bigger they are if you get a big cabin cruiser or a big ski boat oh gosh yeah you bet power boat then there's always uh stuff to go wrong with it the sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up but you still have to sure worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging uh everything that's in it it takes a a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up but you bet i know my wife and i were first married her aunt and ancle uncle aunt and uncle up in New York they kept a boat on Jamaica Bay and we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older Chris Craft and we were involved every weekend in just uh as we visited we were involved every weekend in just helping him redo this and refinish that we just worked all the time but their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen it was sort of neat we but i think that was the last time we were really involved in that was twenty years ago or twenty five years ago it is a lot of fun well it's a lot of fun i think um just from the standpoint of getting away from the dodge here and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation uh to especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever uh or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it and but it's uh you bet i visited my cousin a couple of years ago my wife and i and our daughter and he had a place on the Lake of the Ozarks and he had a boat and uh i never seen so many boats in all my life people actually park their car when they get to their place they're staying and townhouse or condominium whatever they own and they they go boats i mean they go if they wanna go to a lounge to have a cocktail they use the boat use the boat for transportation they just go across the boat and get a and tie it up and go in huh and that was sort of neat yeah that's that's that's true that's exactly how they do it they go to dinner that way go to all the restaurants that was sort of a neat setup i enjoyed that we spent a week with them i enjoyed that yeah that would be fun but i'm envious i'm envious of people that have the big boats and uh i've just never i've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat um once i get my son into and through with college he's gonna be starting uh Rice next year so he's going off but um once i get to that stage where i'm not paying for something else and uh i i don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things where i've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it uh you bet i might do something differently i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them keep it and maybe consider getting a a better one for me uh think you think you'd really enjoy it yeah i think i would uh i the sailing part of it i like uh because it's so quiet yes and if you get a big enough one then you've got a little motor on it also where if it's light wind you can still putt around a little bit and have fun oh that's or if or if the wind dies you're not stuck in the middle of the lake i've with my little one i've been out there many times on a calm summer day yeah that's great where all of a sudden the wind stops and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in and oh i know and that gets hot and and wearisome doing that and if you have if you're have big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on there at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in and putt putt sure well that's neat where do you work who are you with but it's fun i own an insurance agency a managing general a wholesaler of insurance uh out in Addison and uh well good i'm a scout leader though so i'm i'm out with  hi what do you think about gun control well uh sort of mixed feelings about it i guess uh uh i i side i lean more towards the control side than than towards you know just the the free free arming um on the other hand i it's it's sort of an issue of of uh uh i'm not i'm not a great fan of of government control in general and so it's it's kind of a tough issue what about yourself well i guess that i would like to to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or um have a legitimate use for the the the weapon i suppose because also living in this area the the problems in DC come home very quickly um-hum i'm i'm sure yeah um so you would take a position where somebody without without a uh um specific use in other words if they just wanted to have a a gun to have in their home uh you wouldn't you wouldn't like them to be able to do that is that well i'm not so sure about that but i think somehow uh safety courses or i don't know whether this could be something that was done in school but somehow people i'd like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were whether they followed them or not you know at least there's the moral issue that they they knew better which is sort of you know flaky but still huh yeah i i have i i have the impression that that the the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not are are are probably not from the people that are are buying them through legitimate channels anyway um that may be wrong um you know i mean certainly there there are cases of of you know the children who find their parents' gun or something and and shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided and that's that's certainly within the channels right um-hum but um a lot of the the crime i think that goes on i i don't know to what the degree the guns are are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns yeah i don't know this morning in our paper it there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license so he went over there and got a driver's license the same day bought three guns and went up to New York and sold them for you know very high markups now in a sense that's a legal uh-huh way of getting the guns but certainly the the purpose is not very legal yeah uh-huh yeah i i mean i think uh some states or i i i don't know if anybody actually has implemented i think so um at least there's been talk about doing uh you know like waiting periods and and things like that um and and uh um-hum you know i i think stuff like that is perfectly good i mean basically if you if you don't intend to do anything strange you know if you if you're buying it for legitimate purposes waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem you know and and things i don't know i've right you know i uh i don't own a gun and and don't really want one and i'd just as soon a lot fewer people did um but on the other hand you um-hum know uh like i say i kind of kind of against government control in general uh right and i suppose complete uh you know complete total ban would lead to more illegal weapons yeah and i you know something about banning is that you know there there are so many weapons out there that it they're not gonna disappear anytime soon um and they're already i know there's a ready market for them you know in the stolen the stolen stolen guns can be sold i mean their first thing a a a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun um-hum um-hum right because uh because they they can be so easily sold and you know their their i don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country but um it's not like they're gonna disappear all of a sudden um even if you do do a total ban on them uh-huh it's a real tough problem right i i don't know i don't know where i really come down on it i mean i i grew up my father was a hunter right and that's and that's sort of almost a separate issue i think we've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing right um-hum you know and but that's true i mean some people grew up with guns in the house we never had any in the house so to me the you know the first time i saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing uh-huh hm and i'm not sure that's good either yeah well we you know we i grew up with them i never really took to hunting i mean i did some of it but uh you know we didn't have any we never had any handguns or anything like that we had you know had shotguns for for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that um-hum and you know it was a whole different thing and and gun safety was taken very seriously and it was you know i mean before we go hunting we we took safety courses but it you know that's that seems to me just to be a whole another issue um you know the the thing that the i yeah i'm not certain that people are are are terribly concerned about other people um-hum  okay Cindy you there yeah okay what kind of dinner parties have you had yeah well i've had them uh where i've served up to twelve to sixteen people um and i had help with them um and um-hum part of them i did were like a buffet and uh it i had uh uh-huh just different uh side dishes and appetizers and one of them that that i'd remembered was uh some uh sausage hors d'oeuvres and uh anyhow uh you take uh a couple of uh cups of Bisquick and uh uh-huh sausage oh like a a Owens mild you can i guess you could use the hot if you wanted to yeah and uh you whatever you like huh yeah put that in and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese and put that in and a little bit of milk and um-hum make make it all doughy and then like i just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes and they are so good hm oh that sounds delicious yeah yeah it's making me hungry for them right now yeah you know i've made like little Swedish meatballs but they're just made out of the beef you know have you yeah and uh with spices and things in them but never anything mixed with Bisquick uh-huh i i've used that quite a bit and it and it seems to work real well um and uh um um-hum hm when i've had so many people uh to to feed like i'd try to do a ham an a turkey and and yeah that's my that's my parties mostly is at Christmas time and Thanksgiving time yeah you know i've uh i had an open house party here once when after we moved in here uh which i had uh things like that but i always cooked them ahead of time and then i just sliced them um-hum you know and had macaroni salad with uh shrimp in it have you ever had that no what get some fresh little fresh shrimp and it's in your macaroni salad that you make uh-huh the shrimp just gives it a really good flavor oh i'll bet yeah i don't like the can but the fresh you know yeah i'll have to try that yeah that was really good i like things that are easy and and uh nutritious yeah right right but uh at uh Christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner you know uh-huh which is kind of hard because you got so many people and then by time you pass everything around it seems like everything on your plate's cold i know i know well thank God for microwaves you know so but anyhow i yeah you can always take your plate and just heat it up you know yeah but uh other than that i i don't have too too many parties uh you know i have like maybe just a couple another couple over for dinner um-hum um-hum but uh other than than than that i don't have you know a whole bunch of people like except except at Christmas and i have my family yeah right well i don't anymore yeah it's been a few years and and uh i don't have you know over a couple either and and uh i try to um-hum uh have everything all ready and and it it just makes it a lot nicer where i don't spend spend all my time in the kitchen yeah right right and uh spaghetti and yeah that's easy i always like to have that too you know everybody seems to like that too yeah i know i don't think i've ever met anyone that didn't no everybody likes that yeah and then uh if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else all in there you know especially if a pork roast that's what i love oh yeah i like it too with my and um other than that in fact i'm just thinking of what goes next weekend when the Super Bowl's on i do too um-hum i've asked a couple people to come over and i just uh had been thinking what to have for that yeah well have you had any good ideas yet oh okay no not yet no and i you know i don't want to have to come away from the TV i want something that i can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the TV yeah you know so i'll think of something just that that we can munch on over there you know yeah and they can just fill fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down and that's the way to do it too yeah yeah i think it's you know what's i think is so nice is that in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen and and it makes an awful lot of difference doesn't it yeah preparing it right oh it sure does well well when i was brought up you know we didn't  um go ahead tell me what you think do we get our money's worth hey listen if i had my way i wouldn't pay my taxes not with the not with some of the things that i hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things yeah did you see Sixty Minutes last night no i did not i was well they did a thing on the the thirty five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need and uh well how does this grab you how does this grab you it's staggering um this i i mean i'm i'm a lady but this i heard this on a Christian program and it was uh about the NEA and that's the National Endowment for Arts and they fund they funded this thing this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money well there are a lot of things that people i think generally and then it just frosts me terribly well i think it's interesting to look at um where the money goes and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and i don't think generally i think what's interesting is absolutely that we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with i believe that's true yes and that what i think is gonna be really interesting is what we do about it i mean we are gonna have to change the people who represent us that's correct i mean and i think it's gonna be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh heavy involvement from the public yeah right that's your i think that's the only thing that's gonna change it and um-hum yeah heavy involvement from the public our our anger is gonna have to to give rise to to more activity on our part yeah um i've i've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active and in our society uh there's very little full employment most people in this country are getting worse off not better off absolutely eighty percent of the public according to Bill Moyer's uh recent uh piece for uh Public Broadcasting which by the way is a very good use of government money i think PBS is wonderful but this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes and thus standards of living decline and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve that's not a formula for a better society no it is not it's lopsided very much so and the government really plays a role in this uh-huh that's right they pull the strings i mean well well they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful interest right the yeah you know and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of of the voter revolting but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't and they think it's unfair and when they recognize it's their tax money they're gonna do more about it i think i'll tell you one quick uh one thing very interesting CBS after the State of the Union address is gonna open up a telephone line an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country they expect um-hum opening it for one hour that they'll get three hundred thousand telephone calls i'm sure they will and i've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to put create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government um-hum like one eight hundred capitol or something like that you know you just a number you could call from anywhere anytime i think that's coming and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change until then uh-huh i think you know it's gonna be really painful so the question is how soon are we gonna start to get our money's worth and as you said it's how soon we get involved and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look do it this way not that way or i like this or i don't like that or this is how i feel about your spending my money on art that i don't think is art yes i understand that but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it well that's the good thing about what is happening because i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it is telling us more you know about the problems so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country oh absolutely over a very long period of time right absolutely um and uh we only see the tip of the iceberg it's only you know there's so much right yeah of it going on that it would really you know uh set us into a deeper depression if we knew the whole picture well you may be right what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say it's it's a  how many children do you have um i have one child a little girl who's eighteen months old um okay we've got one he's uh thirteen weeks yesterday oh wow congratulations yeah um actually even though our daughter is a year and a half we just got her last July we adopted a little girl from Beijing oh okay from Beijing uh yeah my wife is also Chinese oh okay pardon my my wife is Chinese yeah and so we um traveled to Beijing and we adopted her and so we're she's just at a playful age right now we just do a lot of things play with her and take her to a park of course can't right now it's too cold to go out too much here it's been really cold yeah but um it's not not real toasty here either but i imagine it's a good deal colder in Iowa yeah uh although we were gone for most of our Christmas and we had a nice time in in California for our vacation visiting family yeah so um yeah is that where you're from originally no that's where my wife's from and we also visited Seattle where i'm from okay and so we just love mainly we we like to spend time playing games and um just she's sort of at a playful age teaching her new words things like that uh yeah right now uh our son's just uh dealing with grunts and squeaks and grinning and crying and yeah so yeah your your activities probably consist of staying up at night um actually no he sleeps real well at night really yeah that's good he'll he he generally sleeps through the night uh he'll go down about till well he don't doesn't go down till about ten ten thirty which is a little tough when you got a lot of studying to do but uh he'll uh he won't get up till like six o'clock uh somewhere between six and eight in the morning oh that's nice he'll be ravenously hungry by then uh-huh but he's truly a jolly little fellow and sleeps through the night too which is a real blessing uh it it took about the first four weeks before he started that which i don't think it was quite coincidental but he started sleeping through the night about the time we took him out of our bed and put him in a crib in in the next room uh-huh suddenly he started sleeping through the night almost consistently well we found that was important too for sleeping through the night um having um their their own room yeah yeah in fact it was almost trained out of our daughter during vacation where at our parents' house where it's just um one room for all of us our daughter and us um yeah the first few nights back she was terrified to be in the room by herself but now she's yeah sleeping through the night again so yeah that's good that's good um we pardon my wife um is we also other things we're trying trying to do um um is potty train our our girl a year and a half that's a little some people think that's a little bit early but um she was the foster parents our friends in China who had taken care of her before we could get her um um-hum have a Chinese generally potty train their children a little bit earlier earlier and um yeah so um we're having spend some time with that also yeah but and that's got to be a a lot of fun yeah well i'd she doesn't enjoy it that much but um she's learning slowly but surely yeah yeah uh uh it's you know we have a little book it talks about giving rewards and so it's a pleasant experience and things like that yeah yeah well they they the children are gonna to eventually training wind up training themselves but um they can be trained into it pretty early too so i remember some of the strange potty training experiences when i we were growing up amongst brothers and sisters so uh-huh and we're almost kind of not looking forward to that yeah but there's a lot of we we're just having lots of fun with with our little girl right now um she has lots of toys got little anyway yeah she especially likes the little telephone and the little tyke bike that she has yeah um and then reading she likes us to to go through the books you know and she could say a few word you know she could learning to say the names of you know a lot of simple animals and um and the you know the sounds that they make um like duck says quack yeah and doggy says ruff things like that so that's about her her stage right now and she's running around she she started yeah that's good when we first adopted her we she she wasn't walking yet but she was soon walking within a couple weeks after that and now she's running all yeah  what do you think about drug testing well unnecessary a necessary evil i guess yeah i think that it's appropriate in some job categories uh jobs that involve safety and you know that that performance of which really would have an effect on the the the lives and safety of other people you know health professionals and people who uh operate machinery and fly and or drive whatever i think that those are really important i'm not sure how i feel about about other jobs just uh for the purpose of determining whether or not an employee is drug free you know on on general principles well but i can really see the justification for the others yeah uh i guess i'm uh partly biased since we just recently our company's gone to the uh process of initiating drug testing on a random basis uh-huh for all job categories everybody uh in the corporation uh-huh so whether you're an executive behind a desk or you're operating a vehicle or whatever that's correct and and how do they how do they do that how often generally does random mean well it's uh other than they uh they insisted on the uh you know management and and supervision taking the uh being done within the first year which we've all been done you know uh seems to be so in the past month the past year oh since nineteen ninety one it started is that right uh right actually late in ninety it was uh-huh but you know they it's fairly infrequent it's just that it's there you know uh-huh uh-huh when you say infrequent is it maybe once a quarter or oh Lord no i don't think uh first of all in my group hardly a fourth of them have been tested you know how large is that group uh it's about uh twenty people uh-huh uh-huh so what do you see as the reasons that they chose to do that that the company chose to do that well was it insurance issue or that uh they want to you know social uh issues safety issue uh-huh so uh on a performance level there was actually a problem with abuse of substances and they wanted to make sure that they were reducing that or yeah i think that that was probably the prime motivation and insurance like you say to get uh uh-huh yeah what kind of a company is it Texas Instruments oh i guess i should have figured anybody i talk to in Texas is is probably from TI yeah interesting well they really i guess i shouldn't stray from the subject but they have some very interesting topics for for questions i often wonder who has created them yeah i guess there uh may have been just a committee throwing out suggestions was the response from the employees regarding drug testing favorable or it was uh it was received at our site here in Houston fairly easily however in Austin where they have a lot of engineers and uh i guess a younger set uh people they uh they were pretty uh a lot of people quit over it and uh quite a oh really quite a bit of furor yeah interesting quit on general principle i guess yeah there was some people that just actually quit because of the their uh objection to the policy being forced on them you know uh-huh uh-huh is there some concern that the tests may not be completely accurate that you might be taking some prescription medication and and uh i don't know how much of that there is i don't think it's that big of an issue because they've hired a national company and it's you know handled be interpreted correctly third party and there's supposed to be a lot of safe guards and all that uh-huh uh-huh do you know if anyone's been uh um disciplined or oh yes they've they've they've been people that have been uh the company has a you get a two step process the first time if you're caught you have to uh take a uh you know go into a program to even if you're not you know still have to go into a program even so even if it's you know one time yeah if you're if you're you're high you know if you fail the test whatever reason you have to go in into a program and uh course that can be very quickly taken care of if you're not a habitual user or whatever uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh then uh after that first time chance then the second time it's automatic termination so seems fair certainly if people are prepared for the fact that there's a chance they're going to be tested you think they'd be smart enough if they did have a problem to eliminate their use yeah well it's it's almost become a uh non topic anymore  okay you're probably uh more up on this subject than i am but the roles that women have played the last couple couple of year in our are couple of generations that right well they've entered the work force more uh you know since World War Two is when they started you bet and uh i think that that is you know very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women you bet you know where i've noticed it more i think is i'm a traveling salesperson and i have traveled most of my life and i know just especially in the last oh ten years and really since the in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling right you know as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers i sell sporting goods and even in our industry uh there was virtually really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell and even in the last five five or six years boy you see more and more women being involved and you know it's a it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things yeah the you see more of that you see more of them uh leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel too you bet you know i i go to a i have a club that i belong to Altrusa that you know one of the girls travels quite extensively and she said well my children have two parents you know why not you bet that's sort of neat so that that's a i think that's a change and i think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the in the future people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing sure i think uh it's the age age old thing every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on TV or something where the discussion comes out that you know women are paid less than men and they're and they're doing the same uh or carrying the same job responsibility and you know i that's a very true statement and it shouldn't uh it shouldn't be that way right no that that i think should change will change in the near future also it's been changing it's been evolving but there's still a an and i think so hope so and an unequality in the work force in certain jobs it's you know and you hear some people say you know well he's a man he he he needs that salary absolutely you know i've right yeah they forget also i think uh a good argument for that is in the area of politics you know if if a a woman Congressman i'm sure makes as much as a man Congressman as and the same as a senator or whatever right so they certainly uh they certainly deserve it all the way but i guess just the most significant thing change for me again as i mentioned it was just in traveling you see uh more and more ladies all ages with briefcases and uh and in their business suits and and going and going yeah um-hum and i expect you're right in regards to having two parents now that's a good a good statement and i think if in the future it's even gonna be uh more noticeable and more significant right yeah i i think it will be i think i well another another thing i read too the other day this is not just for working women but how much they're out there i guess is that car designers um are starting to design cars with women in mind um because in the past the male bought the cars but now they're showing that fifty five percent of women are actually making the new car purchases wow and that they are looking for um different things in the car the man is looking for the engine in the engine and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel you bet uh can her makeup come off the upholstery and if they're out there buying that many cars then there's that many out that are self sufficient and you know mobile and working good point right now i'm self employed and and my wife's always worked she's a schoolteacher but for she started working and then when i first started my bidness uh she was selling real estate at the time and hers was the only income we had for three or four months so right you know she certainly did her part in help getting me established in my business she still works everyday so yeah we all do you bet i'm just happen to be off today so i work too uh-oh enjoying enjoying it what kind of work do you do i'm a nurse well good and i work at Medical Treatment Center um which is at Garland uh Jupiter and Arapaho right married no yeah well well trying to think what else i can say in regards to this subject i don't know i'm kind of out of out of things you see the old uh cigarette ads you know about you've come a long way you've come a long way baby baby right and uh you think about this when you coming to a when it comes to a subject like that right it's really true women have come a long way and you know  why don't you tell me about your choir oh okay well we uh are a group of uh musicians that just kind of have you know formed out of a desire to sing and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they or just real talented i should say lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching uh others have there's one gal that's in the uh Plano Community Orchestra um-hum uh just you know different backgrounds it's been really kind of interesting great so um um i play the piano and uh i have a four year old who who has started to play the piano he does that uh musically listens and then he can play which is kind of interesting i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the since he was a baby oh yeah um-hum uh my husband and my other son who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here in in the community at Music Man oh they did yeah and it was lots of fun how did how did they get involved in that um basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions it was the Plano Repertory Theatre um-hum and so they went and tried out and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man and my son played one of the children in a band oh how fun so yeah it was really fun and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school and my daughter takes piano lessons too yeah um-hum but uh we just really like music it's a i i especially like it as an outlet when the TV goes off we get the TV off and and just have some nice quiet music um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah yeah that's nice you say have your four year old taking lessons already um-hum and uh who do you have her or him take it from um i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki uh-huh which is an auditory type learning experience you listen to the music and then learn to play it by learning by hearing the intervals and things like that um-hum i teach uh like what is traditionally taught you know you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano but he can't learn like that he's a delayed child he's only about i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things oh and uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it uh with his right hand we went wow we better have him do something do something you know educationally um-hum yeah yeah so that was really fun my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown though well because my pardon me so my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas um-hum um-hum well i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taken piano lessons since the started out at the age of just turning five because she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is um is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally she just oh i think that's great so i wasn't sure when to start her i didn't want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene that's really hard i think because especially if you start them and then they get pretty good and then they get close ten you know eleven or something and they go i don't want to do this anymore and you're like um-hum God i really want you to do it you know so sometimes it's hard to to know exactly when but yeah yeah i don't know if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it um-hum um-hum yeah i think she'd like to i just don't know if it's really knowing from what my daughter has gone through she's she learned a lot and it course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it it was something easily forgotten so uh-huh um i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight or or should i say seven i mean she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's gonna excel just naturally she does have to really work at it but um so yeah uh so i'm kind of you know just playing with it but at this point we're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but that's like me well it can get expensive that's for sure yeah yeah i my friend is is very generous in in letting us have my children uh do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out um-hum oh that's good yeah so it's been good for our family well as a piano teacher do you have any feelings from kids who come from a Suzuki method have you had any former Suzuki students i don't have any Suzuki students um something happening to me at Christmas time that that verified to me that i will always i was wondering how they  so you have a child yeah we have a two years old in child care right now two year old daughter in child care and we went through the process of searching for child care and uh finding what we consider to be real good child care at a uh um-hum pretty reasonable price we think how about you do you have any children uh yes our first and he just turned three months oh boy so we're just starting into hunting for child care right now both of us are students yeah are you where are you student uh uh University of Southern Mississippi no kidding um i was a professor in a university here in California for a while she's yeah yeah uh are you gonna uh put your son in child care in a a year or two uh probably um yeah actually spring semester a year from now he's gonna have to be in child care for uh five days a week more than likely uh depending on how my class schedule runs because my wife will be doing her internship that semester it'll be forty hour week not no eight to five type of thing yeah uh-huh yeah so depending on what my class schedule looks like he may spend four six anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care by that point right now we're trying to avoid it but we just a matter of fact just yesterday hired a a girl to uh watch him uh i get out of class at certain time and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class you know once a day this overlap happens where we can't one of us be home so for about twenty minutes twenty thirty minutes a day we got a babysitter comes in yeah yeah well that's a good experience i think and uh there are a lot of things to think about and the articles that are written on the topic are pretty good and they kind of boil down to uh any other important decision you really have to explore the alternatives and what we found um-hum um to be the best guide was our own instincts about people who were gonna be loving and uh that's more important than anything else we could have sent uh her to a fancier um-hum yeah um facility um she goes to a home this is a um um-hum a couple uh emigrated from China early in in their lives they've been here probably thirty forty years they've got three daughters um-hum yeah um and they have a loving home and uh they're both there and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon um-hum and our daughter is healthy happy well adjusted and enjoys going to see her friends so it's a good experience i think if it's good i think it's very good for the child yeah uh that makes a big difference yes and if it's a loving environment i think it's very good and and that's really what we've learned about it she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of a preschool in a year yeah but um we feel real fortunate and we were able to uh just uh choose in the marketplace i don't know what it's like around uh Hattiesburg there's a lot of child care available but invariably there's waiting lists uh-huh yeah and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list with the uh okay the university uh university's uh uh department of um uh well their Home Economics Department yeah i'll bet they're involved yeah um they uh they have a subbranch uh American Family Counseling and their people staff this this uh the child care center just off campus but uh they have a pretty good size waiting list so uh yeah well that's uh i know it's it's a real uh hard thing to do even for people in in uh university communities out here at Stanford they have a um-hum you know a a a real good facility and there uh is is quite a waiting list to get into that so it's uh yeah you know it's a it's a it's an important decision it's an industry that's still a cottage industry and i think that it it really is buyer beware yeah well it's best yeah a cottage industry's the best way to do it really because if you over well it is the best way to do it interestingly i think that um my own interest in in development human development leads me to believe that that's a good sign and that um um-hum private enterprise is the way to go and that it will lead to a fundamental change in the way we learn because i think what we're gonna go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market as a matter of fact my future is banked on that yeah yeah uh professionally because i believe that that there are uh pressing needs in the marketplace unmet by schools colleges universities for um-hum uh learning a lot of things that kids can learn watching Sesame Street and in child care primary skills which turn out to be the most important skills in life yes it's amazing how much good things like uh Sesame Street will do it's it's phenomenal it's phenomenal the the programming is uh the human operating system is my area  so Cathy what do you do in the way of lawn and garden work well we have Bermuda grass here do you have that there um i don't know exactly what that is it's a kind of grass that dies in the winter time um i don't do you live in an apartment or a house yeah i live in an apartment so you probably don't do any lawn care yeah that's that's actually correct oh okay well we used to have a service come in and fertilize and such but we ran in some into some money trouble so we do all of that ourselves now does the grass die there in Iowa in the winter time is everything brown um it turns brown yeah yeah guess it freezes and everything so yeah so right now we do nothing because it's brown and it doesn't grow until later on in the spring so does that mean you have to replant each year or but no huh-uh it just goes dormant and then it starts it's you know it rejuvenates itself in the springtime there are people that uh that reseed in the winter time and grow something called winter grass or something like that i can't remember exactly what it's called and so it's green in the winter but you have to seed over all of this other stuff that's there and it's kind of hard to grow it's kind of foolish as far as i'm concerned i see so did you grow up in Iowa no i'm actually from uh uh the Seattle area we lived outside outside of the city in the country and uh we have five acres of land up against a hillside where i grew up and so we did have a garden about a one a half acre garden big size oh yeah and grew standard things like corn beans and we had some trees apple trees fruit trees you know and apple trees and did your mom do any canning and that kind of stuff oh yeah huh did lots of canning and we even made an annual trip out to eastern Washington Yakima area to get uh peaches and things like that to can in addition to the the fruit we got out of our own garden huh huh we have a garden here but in Texas it's really hard to grow a garden because it's so hot and the sun is so intense that you know the uh-huh the tomatoes come on and they kind of fry right on the plant so it's real hard and the bugs you know if that doesn't kill it the bugs do so i have tried kind you know with just very little success to have a garden here did you enjoy it did you like to do it when you were there oh yeah i enjoyed um working in the garden um my dad was a big um fan of organic gardening huh and so when we um did our garbage and stuff we separated all the banana peels and egg shells and stuff that yeah you had a compost pile huh yeah yeah and always picked a different place in the garden to dump it out had our own rototiller and rough even though it was a large plot we used a rototiller for the whole thing and so that was it was quite a bit of work for all of us but we five kids and how many how many were in your family uh six kids altogether was it something that the kids mostly took care of actually dad did more than his share but uh we always had our our assignments to help out yeah yeah so and mom did very little of the gardening although she did most of the canning and other things yeah what was your favorite thing to eat um oh to eat oh um the our big crops were were green beans and corn and i guess i liked the corn uh-huh yeah and so now that i'm in Iowa i should be get be able to get lots of uh you'd think so corn on the cob huh so what took you to Iowa uh i just graduated i i'm working at the University of Iowa uh-huh um on a post doctoral fellowship i just graduated out west with a PhD in physics where did you graduate uh Brigham Young University i knew it i'm a member too that's why i was when you were talking about your garden and everything and your mom canning i thought this guy's got to be got to have roots there somewhere uh uh yes and uh so are you originally from Texas no i grew up in California i see did did your family have a farm or were you more in the city no it was more in the city but we did have a um a little garden out in the back because anything grows there you just stick it in the ground and it it grows uh-huh oh yeah yeah my wife is from southern California and their family has a an orange tree and a lemon tree out back yeah and they grow a few things they tried tomatoes and stuff but not they don't have very you know just a small small backyard so there's not too much else they could do there yeah do you have in in your apartment  do you um have a family budget or how do you work your budgeting well for many many years uh my wife and i did have a budget uh we were both working at the time and so forth and um that we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and and other big bills taken care of uh we have a a budget but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation um-hum yeah so it it's uh it's been helpful i mean yes having a budget is very very important and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and uh other major things were taken care of and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before so we're we don't have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did oh well we don't have a real strict budget um we have a a low budget to work on but we um you know for like groceries we saved up this much per week and then we we just spend about so much we don't sure uh-huh i i don't know of a a written figure of expenses that we you know keep to or anything but i know that when i go to the grocery store that we always stick within you know five dollars between here and there um-hum a certain amount i think i've i do that automatically myself i mean i unconsciously uh yeah you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i i have enough food already stored here that i don't have to make any large purchase at any one time all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there oh as the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that wow that's great yeah we have two freezers and course we had a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff and we freeze a lot of that so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal personal storage oh oh you guys sound pretty self sufficient well we we keep a little note pad on a on our wall when if anything is absolutely out make a note of it and then uh the next time i go to the store why i pick it up and fill it up so it's it's worked very well that way at least that way we you know if each of us finds something is missing hm uh we put it up uh the other person might not know about it yeah well that's a good idea that way we can keep up to date let's see the the other thing there the topic was talking about was if you if i don't all i can think of is if you don't keep a real real tight budget how do you control expenses but um one another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas well not fly back but somehow we get back there uh-huh and um this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive and well actually it's more interesting too if you've got the time huh oh yeah and um you know we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare yeah and so um we find that if we're careful with our you know just everyday things like grocery shopping and and gas and entertainment things like that then um somewhere in out in the wash it'll come out that we have enough to get back there you know sure well i think we unconsciously do the same thing excuse me my throat's not as clear today as it should be uh-huh that's right uh we are uh going to be traveling to Europe with a choral we sing with this so called Pennsylvania Choral and we make a two weeks uh-huh tour of of uh foreign countries and of course that costs money so we uh each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that that we gather together over a period a time enough money to to make this trip so that that is another way of uh budgeting uh-huh that's right and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it we uh just live a normal life but we don't throw any money away particularly we save it for this trip which is uh always very very nice yeah well whenever i don't know if this is part of the topic but whenever i find you know a dime or something on the ground i will i'll probably pick it up i do the same thing i have a whole pile of those things that i have found by parking meter uh-huh yeah i have a special little jar that i keep all the money i found in count it up at the end of the year something yeah yeah but yeah well let's face it then when we talking budget it is important to to have a budget and uh i i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking checking account and i have a money market account also uh-huh and uh i keep those levels up above a certain minimum and i'm always trying to  okay here we go so what's your favorite team so uh uh Cowboy fan die hard naturally huh yeah ever since i was last sixteen seventeen years well as long as i can remember yeah ever since seventy six but um yeah big time they are uh oh really everyone's jumping on the bandwagon now after the season they had what part of Patterson and that uh that California is that it's um like seventy five miles from Oakland and San Francisco oh okay so you're up it's in the valley okay okay so i guess you're uh well i used to be a Raider fan when they were there but now i'm a 49er fan yeah there you go there you go you know and the 49ers just went down down down this year yeah but if they would've made to the play-offs i mean they were they were the hottest team i thought at the end of the season it's just it's kind of yeah it's kind of bad that they miss out on the play-offs with a tie breaker or whatever but yeah yeah right right that so what what do you think's gonna happen Sunday uh i think it's um Buffalo i hope it's Buffalo i i really do i think it's their time to you know i'm really i'm everyone's picking Washington but i don't know i mean i think the AFC's been getting beat up every year you know lost a few Super Bowls that um-hum um-hum um-hum because they went last year they should have won it and you know missed that kick but yeah lost by what one point yeah pretty bad for the kicker but yeah i think they'll do it i mean naturally Redskins uh-huh and the Cowboys don't have a much like for each other but um well at least Dallas was in the play-offs you know yeah it's the the way they went out that didn't go over and it killed by Detroit but they're young team i mean they got all those draft picks next year i mean their future's yeah i mean they're one of the young i mean they got so many stars and with Jimmy Johnson i mean you never know what he's gonna do it's just that guy's a wizard drafting people um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum do you get to go to very many games i went to four games this year actually um uh-huh friends of mine have season tickets we've always it's always um each year we've taken turns in getting them and kind of switched around on them everything and i just graduated and i moved back so i got to see more games finally um-hum um-hum um-hum i went to school at Texas Tech out in Lubbock Texas for last four years i so saw the games on TV but i hadn't been to any since yeah Thanksgiving once i guess hm um-hum um-hum um-hum so you make any many 49er games no i've never been to a 49er game i used to go to all the Raider games when they were in Oakland and yeah i guess it still want them back in Oakland huh uh it would be nice yeah but uh i don't think that's ever gonna happen yeah i guess there's not many Al Davis fans out there you know um now i'm just waiting for something to come out out this way out in the valley uh you got just so many Sacramento still has a chance i guess of getting a team someday yeah there's so many teams out in California though i mean that's what the Rams the Raiders the um-hum um-hum uh uh that's just so you plan on uh watching the game Sunday yeah um going Super Bowl party actually so um um-hum um-hum i'll be out there for do it every year how about y'all well that'll be nice yeah that'll be nice yeah we're gonna have a little few people over to watch the game you know just serve hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that so we won't have to miss out on anything right and there you go so yeah i i just wish it would start a little bit earlier because i guess well out there it starts at four but starts at six here you know that's i don't i mean people you know that they're wondering why their ratings go down every year it's because people get don't like to i know it's too late huh yeah i mean but a time because lot of people you know they got to work the next day they don't wanna be sitting around at nine or ten at night and you know they start taking off but yeah i was wondering for sure what time it started i thought it was three or something but you say it's four out here huh yeah it's six it's six o'clock here like six eighteen so it'll be six o'clock your time huh that's terrible but it's one good thing about living out there daylight everything yeah yeah yeah but um well well i guess that ought to do it yeah um okay then it's been nice talking to you Brad all right bye-bye okay yeah all right thank you later bye  well are you in the market for a new car uh well yeah i am as a matter of fact well actually actually i'm looking for another car but uh uh new probably not oh what sort of requirements to you have for your car uh sports car uh usually either black or red uh-huh um and and electric windows and power locks no i see top of top of the line well uh not so much that as it is i've had so many times when uh uh you know i i'll have a friend next to me or i see somebody uh guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window oh it is just a real pain or you know if i'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and uh somebody that i know and you try to talk to them it's real difficult to drive reach reach over and try to roll down the window um-hum right right and uh so power locks and power windows are just just things that uh uh just really help a lot what about you um-hum um-hum well i guess i'm um more traditional in that i don't like power power windows or power locks because the people that i know have who have them always seem to have trouble with them oh and um so i don't i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work and then i want you know good uh gas mileage and i want an air bag and sure uh i guess a good have you ever had a car with an air bag no i haven't have you no somehow i just think you know i like the idea well it it seems sure seems to save lives and uh yeah i actually i like the antilock brakes right right that's a good idea and i've never had a chance to i have been in cars that have had them but i've never tromped on the brakes to see uh you know on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up um-hum um-hum but uh you think you'd buy uh an American car or a European or Japanese well i actually i don't know a lot about different brands i tend to have you know my requirements like the last time i bought a car i i guess i did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically you know good repair record good mileage um and i needed air-conditioning and um can't remember what my oh i wanted uh stickshift and so i didn't have a whole lot of choice there was one car in all of the the metropolitan area that i could find that you know was sort of a medium priced car with a stickshift in it it it turned out to be a a Chrysler um what was that Lancer huh stick shift huh did it have what a three speed or a four speed yeah no a five speed and it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it wow so i guess in this area at least you know if it's not automatic it doesn't move well actually i much prefer a stick shift and what i'm i'm curious i i know why i love a stick shift why do you why did you want one well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one and i thought it would be more reliable um-hum um it's hard to find stick shift cars anymore i found that out i mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when you went in to and they asked and said that was the requirement so huh yeah no i mean most of the sports cars are stick shift yeah well i'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area not that i was looking for sports cars but now the people i've talked to don't seem to have stick shift huh huh and so why do you like stick shift um i guess i i grew up on it and it's fun it's it's an enjoyable part of driving i do feel like i have uh more control um-hum over the car and it it to me it gives me more a lot more control in the snow and ice and slick conditions um-hum right right uh it it it does uh i don't know it it's really more fun than anything else as long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic it's fun um-hum right and actually it's probably safer on you know uh long trips because it keeps you more active yeah yeah so yeah uh of course i like gadgets and and uh fun things on on the cars which are all the things course the could  ready so what do you think do we spend too much on the space program or well i think they ought to spend uh i don't think they ought to spend overly spend on it but uh i don't see anything wrong with you know having a pretty good budget for it because uh do you heck i don't know i don't i think maybe one day they will uh find a good use for it you know maybe they haven't all that much yet uh other than the little things they've developed in this space shuttle uh-huh yeah the little experiments that they've done and so forth you know uh-huh in uh i know they asked the question uh would you go if you had the chance and i'd go tomorrow yeah we could oh really if i had a chance oh you're an adventurer huh yeah right what makes it what makes it so exciting for you well i don't know i just it would be something i've never experienced before weightlessness i'd love to experience weightlessness that's something i've always uh thought would be fascinating you know yeah that that'd be fun that'd be a lot of fun uh-huh that's true yeah i'd i'd have to i'd think once or twice but i think i'd probably do it just for the experience i guess but it'd be pretty interesting that's for sure yeah yeah i think so when they had the uh accident you know back the space shuttle accident and i thought well maybe i won't go you know but uh since then i thought well what the heck i'd go if it would be a one time once in lifetime experience i'd try it uh-huh oh yeah you couldn't couldn't pass it up that's for sure no i don't think so you think it'll ever happen where they'll let it'll be common or uh it might it it very well may uh i think it's sort a uh-huh had a setback because of that accident and uh and sometimes i get really disappointed because they have so many delays when they have a launch yeah yeah that's true and everything i think gee you know they'll never get this worked out it just seems like they they delay it more and more every time they have a launch uh-huh yeah so i don't know you know they seems like they sort of bog down they're not really progressing right now to me yeah i'm i'm kind of anxious to see what they do with this uh uh this space station they're talking about you know i think that'd be a step to where you know in the right direction but yeah yeah yeah yeah well i believe that uh they'll eventually make it to Mars you know maybe not in our lifetime but uh you know if this world is still here at that time i think they'll i think they'll eventually do that uh-huh yeah yeah i'd uh just the way we progress i i like i say i'd hate to see them cut out the the budget there's a lot of places you know that can use it but just you know simple things like Teflon stuff like that all came from the Apollo mission yeah things they developed right is that right i didn't realize that you know in that program you know i mean mean mean just common everyday things that we take for granted but uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh you know that's as an offshoot it's kind of like the military budget you know there's a lot of things we use because they put so much money in the military sure sure that we end up using just a you know everyday stuff but something like that Teflon something you take for granted you use it every day but yeah yeah yeah yeah if it hadn't of been for something like that you'd never you know really not have got it so yeah well that's true that's true and i guess they've got a lot of uh they've done a lot of medical tests uh-huh uh in space too and uh i mean i don't know what they've they've actually come up with uh-huh but uh i know that medicine is another area that they used that they've used in space a lot you know well they said yeah uh-huh they say in you know in weightlessness they're they're able to do a lot of different things with the chemicals and minerals that they can't do with the gravity so that's right right right there could be some valuable i guess there's a shuttle going up tomorrow as far as i is that no i don't even know about that yeah i think it's they've been a little concerned because it's kind of chilly it's cold you know like you say so they're worried about the oh yeah the the the ice same thing that happened to the Challenger but they are going up to do some tests with some organisms uh organisms and stuff and weightlessness to see how they uh right uh-huh how they react to that and everything but so i think i think you're right though they're getting little better and better sooner sooner you know sooner or later they're going to make some major breakthroughs right to the weightlessness yeah i think i think they'll work it out eventually yeah like you say it will be a major breakthrough right now they're sort of sort of sitting still but i think eventually it will uh they'll it will come to them uh-huh you know yeah it's just a matter of time i guess nothing ever comes without nothing ever comes without some effort so that's right well you know talking about the weightlessness i've uh i've uh noticed that they've talked about like these Russian astronauts stay up there for nearly a year uh-huh you know they have a lot of problems with the i'm not sure what it is with the the muscle muscle tone and so forth because they uh oh really they have been weightless so long and then they course they exercise but it's not the same as exercising with gravity and the i i'm not sure exactly oh really i hadn't heard that what the deal was but there were some problems with long term weightlessness uh-huh oh really yeah and they were trying to figure out how to solve that problem if they were planning on going to Mars because you know it would be a real long term talking about a couple of years i guess yeah huh so it was just that their muscles weren't as well toned as they started or i i'm not sure if it was tone or exactly what it was but i i remember they had a lot of problems with their uh when when they got back to Earth uh walking you know they walk they couldn't walk very well uh-huh uh-huh oh really huh when they finally made it back into gravity and uh i'm not sure exactly why that was you know i mean it was because of the weightlessness but i'm not sure physiologically what happened yeah  planned a family reunion recently the last family reunion i did not plan i only participated and enjoyed about two years ago how about you you know i really haven't and i know of friends who've done it recently and have really enjoyed um the the planning process but uh most of our family see each other fairly frequently so it's it's uh you know not a a major event to to try and plan it because we're all fairly close um it often depends how far you want to go back on on our particular family reunion they went back to my great-great-grandfather so that it was quite um spread out and there were many families um and there were many people we didn't know i think the total participation i don't know how many were invited but there were about two hundred and fifty people there that's wonderful and some of the families one of the cutest things that some of the the families families did was to get T-shirts that identified themselves as that branch of the family oh that's great it was fun so your great-grandfather was still living and everyone up to that point was invited actually he was not he has gone but they decided to go ahead and take the family reunion back that far so that it wouldn't just be people meeting third cousins but people meeting i guess whatever fifth and seventh cousins uh-huh wow and the other thing that i thought was particularly fun was uh the huge they had a huge family tree uh that was posted so you could sort of everybody could sort of see who married whom and uh-huh so that was fun that's wonderful two hundred people who organized it who was the one that instigated the the planning process you know in every family there's usually one person that is gifted to do these things i have a cousin who never marries who is a librarian sounds like a bad novel um and she did she was she's always been interested in genealogy and she's kind of kept track and so i was gonna ask next how she was familiar with where everyone was um i think she just started out writing to key people in the different branches of families and asking them to contact everyone and i really on the family tree there really was everyone except there was just some one group that had sort of gotten lost uh-huh uh-huh in Missouri but this is was in Indiana and it was a lot of the people had kind of stayed in one area uh-huh uh-huh so it wasn't like they were necessarily from all over the country but now given the size of the group were there people were most of the families fairly large is that what contributed to that we're a good Catholic German stock and so yes the original family that i eluded to my great-grandfather had twelve children and they had some pictures of that that was another thing they did that i thought was fun that's great sounds like the trelve twelve tribes of Israel or something that's wonderful i'm sure that was a wonderful experience for the kids too and even if they didn't appreciate it at the moment they'll probably really appreciate it later that's always true they remember most the games they had lots of games and competitions which were fun well are you planning a family reunion no uh uh oh do you how your relatives you're from San you're in San Francisco yeah my folks uh moved from Michigan to San Diego and that's where they raised the three of us my daughter my sisters and myself but uh sometimes when you've moved perhaps your family reunion if there ever one would would be back in Michigan i mean that would be where your roots would be i would expect yeah yeah and i know that my grandparents' families were fairly large but my father has just one brother and my mom has one brother so we've kept in touch those first cousins very pretty closely um i'm not quite sure how i'd even pursue finding the rest of the folks in Michigan this is a little office i think i think each of my grandparents had ten siblings that sounds so there's got to be a few of those second does that make second cousin or third cousin i'm not sure typical i never knew that i i always i thought the children like the children of your first cousins i always called those second cousins and my children and my cousins' children i called third cousins oh okay okay that's how i've always named it some people have this once removed stuff and i don't know what that means so perhaps my grandparents siblings would be my great great they'd just be your great-aunts great-aunt your grandparents' siblings would be your great aunts and uncles aunts and uncles right right and so but it it is interesting sometimes a little sad when families branch out quite so much but i don't know that's the American way did you find that you had a lot in common did people find out things about each other that they hadn't been aware i had two distant relatives who lived in the Dallas Fort Worth area that that i never had met and didn't know they were here and we we all laughed how it was funny to go back to Indiana to meet people who lived really ten miles from you so that was sort of funny in fact one of them it's like my father i don't remember how this was i guess it was actually just my father's cousin so it's not all that far away turns out he even goes to our church here in Dallas so uh-huh  hello hello yes do you have any pets i do i have a big dog oh what kind huh oh he's just a big bloodhound okay i had some rabbits and they were much easier to take care of than this big dog is i bet what happened to the rabbit well we got the bloodhound and the rabbits and the bloodhound didn't mix well so they were easier to get rid of than the big dog and my kids were anxious to have a have a puppy um-hum um-hum uh-huh okay well we have two dogs uh Chasta's the small one that we uh-huh kind of inherited and then we have Lady that Gene has been wanting for a long time it's a collie and she is a sweetheart yeah and we have two cats and one of them now Lady can go up the steps she goes up the steps really really slow and she kisses Nikki and they kind of you know look at each other and everything and then then Chasta uh Lady'll turn around and come back down stairs but she knows that if she moves fast that uh she's going to move you know yeah yeah huh yeah and um by the way my other big pet here said he's gonna call you tonight and okay well i've had some really interesting things happening with my dog let me tell you about this you have i have a dog that at nighttime when it wants to go in the garage because he's kind of spoiled he will bark and i have a neighbor next door who gets real mad at this so for the last three weeks he's turned us into the police and in to the uh the animal control and every time they come over of course he's very well behaved and he doesn't bark or anything and so oh you're kidding um-hum it's just really gotten out of hand i mean he has called and threatened my kids and to come over and kill the dog it's going it's just berserk oh he doesn't have any pets he does he has a dog himself out in the backyard that barks but for some reason this dog's bark just drives him up a wall and he's just um um-hum i don't know it's been really upsetting he keeps calling and oh you know it bothers me when the dog barks so as soon as he barks we put him in the garage but um um-hum um-hum i don't know what the problem is oh for crying out loud well he is an alcoholic so i think he's just found something to vent his anger on and it's he's decided that it's us but um-hum um-hum um-hum well we don't have that problem Lady hardly ever barks at all unless she's outside playing and uh Chasta only barks like when the paper boy delivers the mail she might bark for a little bit uh-huh see that's like this dog it only barks i mean the longest it ever barks is five or ten minutes um-hum hm but you know he's called over and said he's going to get the police to take Lee away and that we're idiots for having a dog like that and i'll be oh that's too bad it's just really been upsetting because they were real good neighbors up until this um-hum this time yeah that would that would really be upsetting with me too if my neighbors didn't like my dogs you know yeah and uh well of course two of two other neighbors have dogs you know and they get to come over and play well see everybody everybody all the way up has a dog that's what's so strange every house all you know all the way up from on five you know five houses up from me and five houses down have dogs um-hum hum um-hum um-hum um-hum well some people have dogs but they really don't like them i don't know why they even keep them yeah you know really some a lot of people have pets and yeah i figure why have them if you're not gonna take real good care of them oh yeah God mine are like my family but at night they sit out here by the door by the patio door and look in you know sit side by side yep that's how this one is so every night i think for two hours every night and then we let them in and they come in they just lay down but just i guess just the idea that they're in the house with us for a while you know huh yeah feel loved huh huh well i haven't i don't know what i you know i can't figure out how to solve the problem unless i get rid of Kahuna and uh you know uh-huh so i've got to live in this neighborhood so it's almost boiled down to do i well do i keep a pet that i love or do i live unhappily in a neighborhood paranoid of whether he's ever gonna bark or not well that's a shame you know and you can i know you can have their barker taken out but who'd want to do that that would be awful yeah yeah you know well that's too bad but anyhow we don't have that problem like i say well i'm thinking about going back to rabbits they were quiet mess free um-hum um-hum um-hum so well at least you can still get some right yeah we have a ample supply of rabbits well that's good well let's see boy well this is really a treat isn't it funny though i just wondered if someday this was going to happen yeah let's hope it happens again  what do you think have been the most significant changes uh mainly the fact that they let women in law now i think that had a lot to do with the way people thought about women so lawyers not just lawyers but police officers and judges and the whole legal profession in general yeah because it used to be strictly male and the views on it used to be strictly male yeah and now there's women in it and i think that affected a lot of things well i think that's a big contributor i think women have uh really um begun to penetrate a lot of fields that were dominated by men for centuries oh i can i can definitely agree with that i'm i'm in a field that most people say is strictly male oh yeah yeah mechanics uh-huh well i think um one of the best things that has happened in the twentieth century has been the uh penetration of a lot of these fields by women and i think it's gonna continue uh and even though it's pretty difficult now for some men and and a lot of women i think uh it's gonna bring very good things and uh we're going to be a lot better off as a society as it continues but it's a painful transition oh yeah very painful especially when you have certain women that take very dim views on mothers that actually work yeah i'm a mother of two and i still hold down a job and a lot of people say well you're not home with your kids all the time your kids are gonna turn out bad i don't think so yeah well i think there are a lot of attitudes that have to change and i guess that's the big thing you know as people change their attitudes that's gonna make the biggest difference women uh participating as equal partners in our society is one of the best things that will ever happen and history will record that but a lot of people really don't like that idea and uh some men but you'd believe you wouldn't believe how many women are against it no i i'm not look at what happened with the Anita Hill testimony before the Senate subcommittee and yeah uh now i'm not surprised by that at all we have uh we have a two year old my wife uh works out of the home um and uh uh i think just looking at how uh her uh views differ from those of her mother a generation before um-hum so it's it it's really changing attitudes and um the economic necessity and the political changes as you pointed out are going to make a big difference i think um it's a painful transition but a really important one and oh yeah and i think it's one of the biggest steps we or any other country in general could take yeah i think it's a big step for humankind and i think uh it's it's real progress but there are a lot of people with attitudes that have to change and i i guess in answering the question that's what i would say i'd say yeah that overall it's just the attitude of men and women toward equal participation and equal pay and equal political influence and all sorts of other things for women because yep that's really gonna be better for everybody but a lot of people are threatened by that as is reflected in what goes on yeah that's for sure and you know a lot of people think that the men are the ones that are fighting this but you'd be surprised the majority of the people that are against women going into the work force doing you know even jobs you know on an even keel with men a good percentage of them are the women that are fighting it and most people say well men try and keep women locked up that's not necessarily true yeah i i mean the women have these ideas that they got to be the little home makers and they have to stay at home or they're not doing good you know a good job and that's not necessarily so but everybody's blaming it on the guys saying well the guys don't let the women out that's not necessarily so it's just the women have to realize they can do both well i think i think both yeah both attitudes have to change and i think uh um it's it's evident evident to me as i look at all the television shows that now focus on the relationship between men and women uh watching Roseanne last night watching uh the show that preceded it Home Improvements all these television shows which reach the American people are beginning to reflect new attitudes and those yep and the fact that women are actually getting out and working and also keeping the home together well and not only i mean the the fact of the matter is that women have have carried more than their weight and are still doing that and um i see i think this is part of the problem for men as well as a guy i recognize that it's uh it's men who've suffered from this too because men need to learn to learn  um what have been some well i'll start out with some of my my vacations um okay um when i graduated from high school um my uh band my jazz band and we visited Europe i visited Germany and Austria um Italy uh Switzerland and that was pretty fun i also have visited South America and just this last summer one of my favorite vacations is i went to China oh boy you're a real world traveler here so uh i i we my wife and i when we went to China we visited the Great Wall and uh the Forbidden City um the Forbidden City is uh right there Tiananmen Square is right in front of it and so that's where all the killings occurred not too long couple years ago and uh also the Forbidden City if you saw what was that one movie that was really famous all right oh yeah um emperor or yeah uh The Last Emperor yeah that was filmed in the Forbidden City so we had to see that when we went anyway yeah that was a well my wife and i are right now saving for a trip to to England oh that sounds fun we would like to stay about a month uh you'll need to save for that unless you have some friends there you're going to stay with because well we do have some friends that we can stay at their place for a while or as long as we want actually but it's you know it's in the southern part so but we want us to go all over the countryside that's our next big vacation we've got planned and just a few days in the London itself is all we're interested in there but mostly to this date uh our vacations have been more like uh anywhere where there's not too many tourists uh-huh i hate resorts and things like that i like to go where you can get out by yourself in the mountains done a lot of camping in New Mexico and uh Colorado uh-huh and one time we even toured Iowa my wife is from Iowa but actually the southern part and uh she'd never really seen a lot of the different northern places and just the lot of the little towns and so we drove around went to the Humana Colonies things like that uh-huh yeah they're not too far from here we really i think she enjoyed it a a lot because she knew more of the history than course than i did of Iowa but it was uh it was interesting uh-huh here in Texas we live in the middle of Texas it's hard to get out of Texas on a driving trip yeah got to go a long ways uh yeah we also don't like to particularly go to tourist spots fact we usually choose to go places where we at least for part of our trip will be visiting someone and uh even when my wife is well and my graduate program that i was in we knew some people who were in Beijing and so uh we were able to stay with them for part of the time in fact they spoke English very well and and helped us around to see some of the places and even when we went to South America uh uh we knew there were people contacts we had there yeah so uh but most people that i that i uh met you know at the university and so uh it makes a big difference to us we like to go for go on a trip with someone who's from the area because i don't know i've i'm afraid especially if i don't know the language right we had had a we went to Mexico City once by ourselves uh mainly because it was just something we could afford to do and we heard it was interesting well we just had a real awful time because we didn't speak Spanish i don't think that would have helped us any anyway it was just a miserable vacation and we decided you know we'll never go anywhere where they don't speak English or somebody that can't help us uh-huh it was by the end of that week we felt like everybody was out to get us uh-huh and that sort of thing and we weren't having the fun we thought we would yeah it really makes a difference because i know even when we went to China when we crossed the border we went over to Hong Kong we were so relieved it was so fun to be uh you know it seemed like returning to civilization and where a lot of people spoke English and uh just the general living conditions were were somewhat higher also so it was uh yeah yeah our last major vacation was uh well we had to go to Iowa to see some relatives because sickness in the family so we took that in for a few days and then we went to a uh to a Shaker settlement in Kentucky and uh it's a it's been rebuilt and we stayed there for three days and it was just kind of neat because we really like Shaker things and we were able to take our dog with us and he stayed with us and it was just the thrill of our life to it was early fall and Kentucky was beautiful that time of the year anyway  well credit cards yeah i'll tell you what i i can't say a whole lot about credit cards because i uh tore mine up is that right i i know people i know some other people that have done that yeah uh i got in some problems with uh financial problems because of credit cards so i uh basically just got rid of all of them i i have a a couple i have a uh gas card that i that i use just for gas and um you know uh one that i use just for emergencies but uh-huh yeah i have i have we have some some friends that did the exactly the same thing they uh you know they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed and finally they realized that they were they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole and they just cut them all up except for for one they kept for emergencies and yeah they're still paying away to get out of debt i know it but no i did just the opposite i i guess i i sort of followed in my uh parents' footsteps i have quite a few of them i use them continually uh-huh but i uh i basically never charge anything i don't have the money in the bank to pay for and uh and i always pay them off totally every month yeah oh is that right that's a that's a good policy yeah and it you know i mean they they're just a convenience for me i don't have to get cash out of the bank and i don't have to to be writing checks and yeah yeah uh sometimes i wish i had them but in most cases i'm glad i don't because i you know unfortunately i uh-huh i i don't have the control you have i wish i did but but i don't uh and it you know it i just don't want to get into that situation again so we'll yeah uh-huh yeah i mean it it's easy i mean you don't have anything transferring just a little signature so what you know oh that's it see and that's even with my gas card you know i find that i'll go in to get some gas and i'll end up buying you know uh-huh candy and drinks and you know sweets and whatever and then at the end of the month i you know i get a bill and i'm thinking what did i get right surprising that costs so much yeah well you know but the i mean there are sort some inherent limits there you're not going to you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that right and yeah that that's true but i can i can understand certainly understand where now i with the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really you know uh not so much discipline i mean well i mean you have sort of a discipline in general about finances but but i hate their their rates so badly i mean their interest rates so badly you know oh yeah isn't it that's unbelievable how let me ask you this how how old are you that i i'm uh thirty three thirty three thirty two excuse me okay you'll be thirty three this year yeah you want to be thirty two as long as you can huh it's coming uh-huh yeah i i know what you mean about the interest rates it's uh it's unbelievable you know i just that just irritates me so much that that i refuse to pay them interest and and my wife recently uh decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off and she's from there and and uh didn't really have the money but you know she could pay it off and so i sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards but she's paying it and uh uh-huh i just won't do it i mean she's paying i don't know i don't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest and i just you know i just refuse to give it to them if i need to borrow that kind of money i'll go to the bank and uh oh jeez yeah and then you bet that's uh yeah i in fact i've i've even uh heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less uh rates oh yeah and have paid off their you know higher interest rate uh cards and just sent them back you know right right yeah and i i guess there's some there's uh uh some negotiating there too because i heard uh on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh call you know if you've got a pretty good rating uh credit rating you can call your in you know your your card wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know uh annual fees or i'll just go to somewhere else right huh well i might you know and if you've got if you've got a pretty good uh um uh history with them right they're more than willing to do that hum i might try that because i i have one card that i've had for about uh i don't know nine or ten years yeah in fact that's that's what this guy you know he wrote a book on it and he says that's you know he's tried it several with several of his cards and he's just told them you know i i can get this card from this bank uh-huh at this rate and yours is at you know eighteen or nineteen percent right it does not make sense for me to do that and if you won't drop my rates i'll just go ahead and send you back your card and i'll go somewhere else and get it yeah for me the big thing you know is the uh uh is the uh the annual fee and i just refuse i won't get any card now i've i've got a good rating and i've got you know and i'm not going i'm not going to pay an annual fee the only one i actually pay on is this one that i that the very first uh-huh  uh how how's the crime rate up there uh well we're right between uh Milwaukee and Chicago okay so there's there's just been a big Coke bust uh here because i think people pass through uh-huh you know on their way back and forth through the bigger cities yeah um it's it's okay i mean there's crime everywhere it it's probably not it's not you know the right best place to be but is it anywhere near Racine yeah it's right next to Racine really my uh old old girlfriend uh was from there oh really yeah uh actually i went i went and saw her about four years ago her parents had moved to Chicago and uh at this point they had moved out of Dallas and everything then they had moved back and she was going to school down here and i went and saw her one summer and uh we went up there uh i never been up there i just remember it's a different area from down here obviously but uh yeah oh yeah it's like ten minutes away from me uh so you're a cheese head huh yeah well we're i mean down here i mean Dallas i mean this crime rate's ridiculous i mean it's just no i'm getting ready to move actually in the probably the next year or so so i mean but really it's that bad the crime because of the crime it's it yeah i mean it isn't Washington DC but it's there's just so many uh i mean we've had like four or five uh since school started like uh in high school people uh incidents where kids shooting you know a teacher or you know since you know the school year and everything like New Year's Eve there were three people shot right away i mean like in the first ten minutes of the new year you know so wow it's just been it's ridiculous there's a lot of problems right now i mean the uh with the the police chief out here is the former assistant police chief uh Darryl Gates in LA so i mean he's not like you know beating up anybody but there's just it's a big city and it's what you know you get and there's there's just getting a lot it's getting overcrowded and there's a lot of uh immigrants from uh Mexico and stuff so oh yeah it's it's it's getting pretty ridiculous but uh i'm sure you know since you're near Chicago i'm sure you could it's not exactly a peaceful city either you know no it's not so it's the same situation really it so i'm actually in Richardson which is just north of Dallas it's a little suburb but yeah i mean it yeah it's gotten worse too nothing's getting better seems like it's always getting worse yeah i don't see how it can get better i mean it's got to totally i think it has to get worse first before it can get better yeah stricter laws or something that yeah uh they need something and it if i could solve problems i'd be a rich person but guess i can't i'm just it's one of those deals where i mean you know try to look at you know look at at other countries what they do but i mean we're not like barbarics uh i don't you know it's just too many problems with uh people getting paroled before uh you know early and coming out committing another crime while they're still on probation we've had a lot of problems out here with that course yeah i heard uh Dallas cops are really strict like well it's it's kind of yeah they shoot first then ask questions later you know that's that's their motto oh yeah whoa they're they're not uh you got to be careful if i mean i never had a problem i mean i'm not like hang just you just don't hang out in Dallas or you got to be you know where not to be at night and the you know just are certain places you don't even certain parts of town you just stay away from you know yeah same here certain parts of our city uh you just don't go by you just don't right and you just yeah you just leave it alone i mean because then you're asking for trouble oh yeah oh yeah how old are you twenty one twenty one yeah yep oh i'm twenty three twenty three yeah uh that's pretty wild right next to Racine huh yeah uh actually uh my sister lives in Racine really yeah God i never thought i would ever run into somebody look i'll read the paper every now and then and something Racine Wisconsin will pop out you know but yeah it's just kind of a little town um it's bigger than Kenosha by a little bit and their crime rate's crime rate's a lot worse than ours really yeah they just some guy uh couple months ago he got out a machete did you read about that and started just hacking people in the street with it with with the machete no i didn't hear about that yeah oh that was in Racine it's sad i mean you can't even drive or walk down the street at night or anything God well uh in Wheaton Illinois where her parents live and that's where that uh i've heard of that yeah it's just like forty five miles outside of Chicago and few years ago i guess there was some uh uh-huh i think it was some um some lady was like shot uh killed attacked some school children  so have you remodeled your house recently i haven't done too much uh i mostly get stuck doing repairs like broken replacing a broken window the neighbor threw a rock through the window with his lawn mower can you do that yourself or do you have it done i did that myself and it kind of surprised me i just paid attention to how i took it out and went to the hardware store and got a new one and put it back in and then you put putty around the edges yeah yeah that's all there was to it i'm i'm impressed that you did that though well the screen still has a hole in it so don't be too impressed we um live in our current house about three years and we've only done minor repairs like painting and we did put a new roof on but previously we had owned a eighty year old house in another city oh wow and that's where i got my real experience at repairs and so i've replaced many windows i'll bet you have but they had wooden they were wooden windows and um i don't know for some reason it the putty seemed easier or something because it blended in uh-huh yeah yeah what all did you do to your eighty year old home did you totally remodel it or had well uh we had a lot of it done i can't claim to have done much of it it had wood floors that we had refinished commercially so that they were all um even tiled what do you i forgot what you call that where you skim the top and then revarnish uh-huh oh yeah and we had it had real plaster walls so we had a lot of plasterwork done we bought when we bought the house uh most of the walls were covered in fabric and although it was sort of pretty when we went through it once that the previous owners had their furniture out it looked pretty bad so when then we took down the i'll bet yeah um fabric to find huge plaster cracks oh no not unexpected i suppose but so we repaired a lot of that and then um we didn't do any real major we moved just a couple walls right right and we put in new bathroom fixture not not we kept the fixtures but we put in like a new we did put in a new bathtub and then we sort of bought the antique looking you know the brass plumbing type thing although it was new oh the oh yeah uh-huh i like old houses but it is everyone talks about it it's true small bathrooms and small closets that that's right yes i lived for a while in Ohio and i was so impressed with the old homes there that the big old homes but i know people were constantly remodeling them and fixing them up uh-huh and plumbing you have to know a lot about plumbing that's right and those lovely old homes had no insulation whatsoever that's right you know we had we ran into an interesting complication um our house it had fifty six windows so we decided in order with an exorbitant heat bill we decided one way we would attack that we put storm windows on and then we put insulation in the attic a a lot of it because we didn't have very much the problem and we never anticipated it was in the summertime uh-huh the humidity it it would rise and in the stairwell at the top of the stairwell it literally would um the humidity would condense on the walls so that the walls would sort of sweat and when we had an engineer come out and talk he just said that we had over insulated our house so it quote couldn't breath and so the humidity when it would you know that the the highest point would go up there and then and then would condense and it was it was really a problem i'll bet it was did it damage the walls well not you could i don't know i'm sure over the long term it would and it would kind of cause sort of streaky pattern in the in the paint um we put in the first thing we tried we just put in a fan in that area so that we could circulate the air and hope that that would help um um-hum we actually took a screen uh door window off one of windows to try and allow a little ventilation in that area and then the truth is it then became uh-huh cooler weather and then we sold our house and i never i always hope that the owners didn't have the same problem next year it's all those things that you don't necessarily want to tell them i don't know i mean we weren't trying to be dishonest or anything you just well you gave it your best shot we gave it our best shot but it was kind of ironic that we thought we were being so energy conscious and you know it's yeah and overdid it perhaps we overdid it i'll bet that eighty year old house had a lot of pretty moldings its prettiest features it had beautiful wood molding high ceilings and it had beautiful cut glass french doors oh and um i suppose that was it's it's prettiest features but and the and the floors were beautiful uh-huh but it much like the Swiss Avenue area in Dallas uh-huh i don't i only have friends there i don't think i have the energy or the money for those sort of beautiful old homes now no i've just recently helped a friend put up crown molding in the in his guest bedroom up around the ceiling of course it was a ten foot ceiling in there and it was a rather small room to that's  uh creates some conversation anyway yeah yeah so what do you think do you think they're honest or they in for it themselves or oh no i i think uh i think they're honest i i you know there are some exceptions i think for the majority of them are honest and uh i just think in uh especially in the federal government the thing has just become bigger than uh-huh both of us all of us and it's just too big to handle and uh i think they look uh yeah they look a lot fairly incompetent at times and and i just think it's i think they mean well they have good intentions and i as you know as far as the topic goes we as far as i'm concerned they're basically honest people but uh uh-huh yeah well i was thinking if they were in for their for their own personal gain they're probably oh they what was that your other line or oh i don't know what that go ahead go yeah but they'd probably you know they'd stay in for ten or twelve years maybe but then get out and use those contacts they made and go work as a consultant for some of these private industries that let me get this other thing here hold on a second okay sure thing hello it's still me okay i don't know what that was uh no i just think the the uh federal government especially is just so huge i mean problems are so big and uh it's so uh-huh internationalized that uh i don't know it just i don't know what the solution is but uh i don't think they're in it for their own personal gain uh yeah yeah there's actually you know you think you know they get paid what a hundred and hundred and twenty five thousand that's really not all that much compared to right well what considering that they have to live up there i mean the living conditions up there i mean not the conditions but the private cost of living is atrocious and uh yeah yeah yeah uh i don't think a lot of them are making uh netting a whole lot of money once they leave up there no but uh oh and i think a lot of them go in with a you know pretty idealist approach that you know they can make some changes and stuff but i think they get in they all of a sudden find out what the real life is and uh-huh right and they're just one of uh five hundred and thirty five and you're just talking about the Congress and the House of Representatives and the Senate yeah exactly well you look at even the President you know he's got to fight against all you know the other five hundred thirty five to get anything through anyway so yeah well i think anytime you've got a a Republican administration and a uh oh a so-so senate as far as uh the split between the Democrats and the Republicans and then the democratic uh House uh whoever's in power uh-huh uh-huh is going to have their hands full and uh yeah it doesn't it's not really conducive to getting a lot done it sure seems like no but uh it's too bad uh but i think it's like a lot of things whether it's a company or an organization of some kind or the goverment federal government it's uh it gets to be too big and uh it controls uh uh-huh you don't have the proper controls in place well then it's going to get out of hand and people are going to look silly kind of foolish foolish and silly when they're uh trying to operate that thing exactly yeah and like you say it's you know the right hand doesn't know what the left hand's doing and the do you know even mouth sometimes are doing going the opposite direction so right i know our state government gets a lot of heck as well down here and uh i don't know about of course about states i don't pay a whole lot of attention to the state government uh we've got a uh-huh uh-huh a female governor and she ran against a real clown here a year or so ago and both of them neither there just wasn't a whole lot to pick from yeah yeah well there was that was a lot of that was public quite uh a public thing i mean we heard a lot about it on national news news that was that Richards wasn't that her name yeah right uh Richards uh Ann Richards is the governor she won then Clayton Williams was the guy that ran against her and he was a west Texas uh rancher and so forth gal that won yeah yeah uh-huh but uh they were both a couple of clowns seemed like there was more personal mud mud throwing than anything else if i if i remember the news reports and stuff but well they they had a good time it was serious business but i think they enjoyed themselves and a lot of people down here just uh-huh so are they doing any good is she doing any good or oh not really she i think uh they she's been in office just about a year now and uh uh-huh as far as her public uh public opinion surveys i think they give her about a fifty fifty rating she she hasn't uh destroyed the place but the economy down here is in pretty bad shape and she can't do much about that yeah yeah but uh she's she's done okay that who's to say how he would have done he he's a business man he's been successful i i uh-huh if i had voted i would have voted for him but she's done all right uh-huh yeah did we just uh we got our first woman mayor up here in Salt Lake uh just this past election and uh you know they made a big deal of that but she's a business woman and that's what she was really pushing was um business mindedness in uh you know in government and stuff and some of those in same business philosophies and it will be interesting to see how she does because uh-huh yeah you know she's kind of a self-made i don't know if she's a millionaire but she you know got her own businesses and stuff but that was her big thing that she was pushing so um uh-huh she a Republican uh no she's Democrat oh yeah which uh well you actually Salt Lake and the county around Salt Lake is quite a bit Democrat so it's not really surprising we've had a a a Democratic mayor for quite a few years um uh-huh uh the state as a whole is probably more definitely more Republican but is that right yeah it will be a lot it will be interesting to see how she does the you know there's she's already stepped on a few toes i think she's making the changes but uh-huh well she's going to have to do  well this is an unusual topic what do you think about it yeah i at first i it took eight times to find you you so i told my husband um you know what should i say and then he reminded me but um um his in his family uh what they usually do on his dad's side his mom or um the aunts will send out little postcards like two or three weeks before reminding everyone where the where to meet and you know just to bring anything and so they just notify everyone by mail and then they just meet at like a park or something to have like a a short um or a small um dinner type thing well that sounds great Ellen how far away do they come from right um they come from well they all meet in Portland and they come as far as oh Seattle and and sometimes we've gone and we were from we were living in Utah at the time oh okay and um but his his dad's family is all around the area and his mom's side of the family they all uh have their family reunions in southern Utah and people would come from Seattle to there and um let's see Nevada and in that area Washington and Nevada to southern Utah and they would um assign a different person each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody oh okay that makes sense nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once yeah yeah and the people who are down there like they'll assign one person in the Utah area one person in the Washington area and that person can call you know beforehand and just make sure everyone knows too um-hum and then they just sort of do like a little program or you know something like that so that everyone's sort of involved yeah that's interesting you sound like you've had a lot of experience with this then oh well that's my husband's side and my mom's my mom's or my family family uh we we all live in southern California so we just have to either call or give a formal invite and we're all there so southern California's still pretty large yeah well i mean LA Orange County area i mean everyone's you know mostly not farther than an hour away i see and yeah well my experience um has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family uh uh-huh years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side and uh they haven't had a reunion since then they just show up at funerals and weddings oh it was pretty serious and lot of yelling and all that but anyway my mother's side wow we had our our first real reunion that i've ever gone to last summer and they had people come in from out of town and they took some some rooms down at a Holiday Inn and uh they had some activity they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree and you know a lot of that sort of thing since it was the first one that we'd had the you you could do that once now next time we have one we'll have to think of something more creative to do well you know that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my uh husband's mother's side together is um they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time and everyone inevitably everyone is just very interested and and they always have you know two or three new ones to add to the list you know someone's been born or someone passed away or you know something like that and so everyone has to update their little oh well have have you do you have an interest in genealogy books or whatever um uh i do but not to very much compared to my mother-in-law not a passion huh um i suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy and i i suspect we will do more of it um i found out some about some of the relatives i didn't you know i i didn't even know their names some of the oh two or three generations back and some of the aunts and uncles and uh there's a lot of things there you have to stop they're really kind of fascinating i found out my grandmother was one of a twin and we don't even know where the twin oh we have virtually no no background on on her on the twin really is that your your grandma's own sibling and she uh my grandmother's uh sister who would be somewhere in in West Virginia i'm sure she's you know dead now because my grandmother died in about twenty years ago oh i see oh so i'm i'm quite a bit i'm probably a lot older than you are um well maybe um they just moved away and then just sort of lost contact and i don't know  so the question is how do we keep up with current events current events you take a newspaper as a matter of fact as you called i was uh taking a look at uh the San Francisco Examiner is that right is that how you usually keep up on the news yeah uh i watch the MacNeil Lehrer news hour fairly regularly and uh the network news less often uh-huh and will watch some of the talking heads programs on PBS yeah uh and that's pretty much about it we don't get Time or Newsweek um and uh as a matter of fact i don't get any of those sort of of magazines anymore yeah i don't either it's mostly by the news but mine is mostly mostly mostly just like the six o'clock news or eleven o'clock is usually about the time i'm ready to look at TV yeah do you watch the network news uh yeah some yeah out here they're moving it to a seven o'clock uh well they're moving the prime time schedule up from uh eight to eleven which used to be eight o'clock at night till eleven o'clock at night now to seven to ten oh and i guess the network news which has moved up in time out here um will move up on all three of the local network affiliates huh i was just reading as a matter of fact about the news coverage of the movie JFK have you have you seen yeah that's had a lot of publicity hasn't it yeah it's really interesting to listen to how different people uh approach different topics um it the i didn't realize this but uh Dan Rather at CBS was the first person to view this Zapruder film that was actually made of the assassination uh-huh and he had viewed it the day after and uh got it completely backwards in terms of what had happened that was significant because of the obvious contention that there were two gunmen at least and not one and uh it's really interesting and he Rather wrote later admitted that he'd gotten the key piece of uh uh evidence backwards that he'd argued like a lot of other people that Kennedy had lurched forward after the shot and he'd in fact been uh forced backward which lends credence to the two right uh to the two gunmen conspiracy theory have you seen the movie i haven't seen it i haven't either but it sure will be interesting to see how see it once i do figure out what all the controversy's about yeah it is uh you know i uh are you one of those people who believes that it was uh not a lone gunman that that we just never really got the full story yeah i don't think we got the full story but i don't you know i haven't seen the movie so i don't really have an opinion about what he had to say yet yeah i i haven't seen the movie either but i i think most of us in this country believe that it just doesn't make sense that it was one guy right and uh but who was involved that's i guess that's the story to tell huh well that's what Oliver Stone's seeking to do and i i think it's really interesting to look at this because i think it kind of gets at the question of how people get their news sometimes uh really important news comes to people through movies yeah just like this years later maybe through television yeah and and i think that's really interesting i know that um uh my wife and i were talking about how uh much uh attitudes toward women uh and and the relationships between men and women husband's and wives uh are changing and i think people get more of that information through television sitcoms than they do through reading the newspaper that's probably exactly right uh that was the topic of yesterday's T I conversation and and uh i think it's really interesting because i think all of those things wind up carrying the message and i think uh um it's gonna be real interesting to see where we go with all of the selective channels that people are going to be able to get via cable television and computer services right so much uh so much more than we can possibly consume in the way of news that's right that's right so what brought you to San Francisco have you um i came up here i was uh working for uh a unit of AT&T and was promoted i came out to California to go to graduate school and and was hired out of the PhD program um in southern California and went to work for a unit of AT&T and they promoted me and moved me up here and we liked it my my wife is from San Diego did did are you living right in San Francisco then live uh right out by the park right uh right off uh Lindley Meadow in Golden Gate Park oh well you're right in the middle of things then aren't you yeah yeah what took you to Texas a job yeah my brother lived out here and he and my dad owned a little trucking company and they asked my husband to come and run it oh yeah but we lived in Concord for several years before that and he grew up over there in San Mateo so we know that uh-huh and you grew up in Walnut Creek yeah how long have you been in Texas right so we um about nine years now that's do you like it i do i really like it that's a i i hear a lot of good things about Texas yeah i really like it it's big it's probably more affordable housing it's boy that's for sure you can't even uh i mean it's not even fathomable that yeah i well i the the we live yeah living here it's just it's  um Ashley um do you exercise regularly yes i do i uh go on long walks whenever i can and uh well when i when i can fit it into my schedule and the weather's right i like to walk uh oh three four miles a day uh-huh well that's pretty good i unfortunately uh am not um exercising regularly at the time um i we've recently made a move i used to be at the university where there's facilities there and my wife and i regularly played um racquetball uh-huh but um since we've moved to Iowa now um we don't have as many facilities like that um well that sort of same sort of thing happened to me i used to be a regular swimmer i i taught at a university and i you know could use the pool every day if i wanted and since moving away from the university environment i've uh now it's kind of difficult to find a pool that's convenient and affordable to swim in but uh what university were you at i was at Brigham Young University uh-huh um actually i am working at a university right now i just graduated with my PhD at Brigham Young and i'm working at the University of Iowa however we had all free benefits for faculty and staff and students at Brigham Young but um oh it's we the benefits here as far as um using the physical facilities are not free here so and plus they're not as convenient we're we're further away so it's not as convenient for like my wife to come in you know for doing things together did you say you're at the University of Iowa Iowa City huh uh-huh right uh-huh i went i visited visited there once quite a few years ago had a friend who was in the linguistics department there oh i'm in uh at the National Center for Voice and Speech which is part of the um Department of Speech Pathology uh-huh um well you would do you have contact with any of the uh people in linguistics well uh i just i haven't been here uh uh only for several months and uh i i'm sure that there must be some cooperation between the departments but uh i'm not aware of anything as yet yeah uh-huh um i well if you ever run into uh to Cathy Reagan say hi to her for me i think she's still there okay okay usually when the temperatures are warmer um i live about twenty minutes from school so um from the university so i often will walk in which i guess it's i'm not sure how far it is um actually it's twenty five minutes and it's probably about a mile i don't know long it's got to be maybe a um-hum well how briskly do you walk do you think how how fast do you walk do you think what oh i walk rather briskly but i don't i don't do it during these winter months it's just far too cold um uh-huh well a brisk walker can go maybe what four or five miles an hour so if it takes you a third of an hour to get in you're probably going oh i would say at least a mile and a half probably so yeah so anyway i could get a little bit of exercise that way um yeah the winter of course even here in uh in northern Texas we do get a little cold weather but most of the winter i can go walking just about anytime i want to uh-huh this winter though it's rained so much that uh there've been times where see my uh favorite uh area to walk is a a greenbelt they have right through Plano here and uh you know it's it surrounds a little stream over much much of its extent you can walk for miles there and never cross a street you you go under the streets uh-huh but uh when the uh when the water is too high uh you'd get washed away i mean they have signs up there warning people to stay away so oh we've had that uh a number of times recently not to mention the mud of course oh yeah well you can get you can do the other thing i do is uh i have a little exercise bike that uh wasn't too expensive i got a cheap one but you can really work up a sweat on it but yeah if i were to begin to begin exercise now i think it'd be something that i could do um indoors something that's convenient um you know it's like an exercise bike or something like that although i haven't purchased one purchased one yet sometimes i do i have this little trampoline yeah small type trampoline that i do indoor jogging on sometimes for exercise but i haven't really started been doing anything regular for the last several months since we've since we've moved to to Iowa yeah i i really prefer outdoor exercise i'm afraid that my favorite indoor exercise is eating apple pie a la mode and that doesn't help very much well outdoor exercise is uh more convenient however  so what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today well i'm think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the or a lot less of the time than they're yeah that's given by the court system but i don't know with the economy the way it is i think crime can't do much but go up no i have to i have to agree with you i had an occasion a couple years ago to hear the Richardson Chief of Police of Richardson Texas speak and you know it's a shame a a criminal today not a murderer but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and you know he does this and he does this for a couple of years hides all the stash and works off of it and then when he gets caught he'll be sentenced something like five to seven years but he gets five days credit for every day he serves i mean it's like a bonus to go to jail so subsequently a five year sentence means he's going be out in uh a year right on probation i mean what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to a stash stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate and uh when he uses spends uses up all that and spends all that money then he uh starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing well there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina the average serves six weeks now see that's a you talk about that's a crime right there well we see we don't have any room in our prisons so well we don't either in Texas they shuttle they shuttle them in and shuttle them out and they get them get them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks and then they're they're paroled uh to make room for the newest criminals and it just it it's just really absurd well it it certainly is and uh that would be a huge concern you know i don't think the general public really realizes this as far what goes on with our criminal system our judiciary judiciary system and everything else it's just uh it's terrible the way it is right now i think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now so many different things coming in so many different directions that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there's absolutely or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it yeah as far as steps to reduce crime if it's uh crimes like we're just been discussing obviously we we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to uh take them off the streets but i don't think that's gonna happen because just like you said and uh yeah our state's a good example your state's a good example and it's just not gonna happen as far as the murderers and people that commit rape and things like that i'm not sure what's right but i know that it's it's not right to put him in there and let let him live for years and years and leers years before you do execute him or whatever because it's has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him and you know to yep i'm sure he gets to watch a lot of TV and i'm sure they have uh exercise facilities and movies and and everything else you know they can have a good time in well i don't know what the answer is but i know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working so no it really isn't it's a big it's a big problem and hopefully something will come out of it so i don't know i hope so i don't i'm uh i'm pretty much of a hard person uh i believe in capital punishment i mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone i mean you know if it's just downright outright oh i definitely believe in capital punishment oh you bet i mean that's the only way to it's when they it's when they're in on death row for nineteen years that i don't i'm kind of curious curious about what oh yeah and you spend thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to uh take care of them and all you know it's just unbelievable yeah you can appeal now in North Carolina for almost almost a period of twenty years can you really yeah you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you i think the i think it's uh the average is eight to ten years to get it to the North Carolina Supreme Court gosh and then uh after that it goes to the Supreme Court of the United States and that usually takes another four to six years so it's oh i know see meanwhile you're living in a country club situation perhaps you know they're hoping i guess they're what they're hoping they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did but it just uh yes we have a serious problem in we have so many problems in this state right now and and the the thing is the the fundamental the drug problems that's another one fundamental problem is the legal is  you been doing in your house uh well since Christmas we painted a bedroom and did some wallpapering in there i had to do most of it since uh my wife was working yeah great where do you live uh Austin yeah and getting getting ready around here to do some uh major yard work as soon as the weather turns a little bit nicer Austin okay great well we yeah as soon as soon as it stops raining a little bit huh yeah well actually the past couple days has made me want to get out there and get started but i figure i'd just be wasting my time yeah yeah great have you done much uh much in the way of home repairs uh i've always maintained our homes as far as repairs and things like that except maybe i don't do heaters and air conditioners but oh yeah i usually do everything else right up to replacing dishwashers and things great how old a house do you have uh this house is was built in probably the mid seventies uh it's kind of a brick ranch not a whole lot needs to be done to it we've only we only moved here about a year ago um-hum oh yeah yeah great what about you what kind of house you live in oh well right now we're not we're living in a travel trailer but uh we've we we've just moved here to Dallas uh recently and we're living in that until we can find a place but uh we lived in a brick homes in uh in Louisiana before this and did some uh various kinds of things uh made some storm windows to put up and uh uh really did a major rejob on the inside of the house uh put up some walls and uh put in a bathroom and stuff like that uh about two years ago we bought a house out at Smithville which is like forty miles east of Austin over toward Houston uh little old stucco house built in nineteen twenty one and uh um-hum oh yeah we bought it to for to get for a weekend getaway and it needed a lot of work but we saw it when we first looked at it we can do this and uh sure enough uh it's oh nineteen months later we sold it for twenty six and we bought it for sixteen five wow that's pretty good yeah and we did things like paint uh inside and outside and basically repaired the garages we put in expensive ceiling fans which was kind of dumb on my part but it was something i thought the place needed because it had real high ceilings and uh just and just in general did everything we uh put in a hot water heater a new toilet and things like that kind of remodeled the kitchen cabinets oh yeah um-hum do you think it was worth uh the ceiling fans on your resale well we weren't think talking about reselling it when we started doing it we were looking for something to do on weekends um-hum and it because my wife loves to pick out paint and experiment and if it doesn't work try another color things like that so but when the offer came to us it was from a neighbor and they wanted their mother close to them and we thought well you know we're not we hadn't been out here but what once in three months and and we had just bought this house in Austin so we thought well what the heck let's make a little money on it oh yeah sure well sounds good you think you'll do it again some time yeah i'd like to uh we have bought new homes in the past and and we'll never do that again because it was just boring for after about a week hum is that right yeah yeah so uh out in New Mexico one time we bought a really run down oh terribly run down home and uh it took us a year and a half to turn it around and make almost forty five thousand in profit on it and that was just oh it sounds like you've got a good bit of experience in that yeah uh it's just we you know we map out what we want to do and we go for it uh um-hum whoever's got time to do it and course you get the major things done like your you know have the floors redone or have carpet put in whatever but the rest of it we usually do ourselves sure we're thinking about possibly building a house now we aren't real sure whether we're gonna be able to do that or not but we just talked to a builder today as a matter of fact you know just uh beginning to think about sketching out some plans and talked about some of the different uh ways to go on you know different things yeah i uh i think about that from time to time because we've never actually you know built one that we wanted you know the way we wanted it and things like that but i'm not sure that our interest is that piqued in it to do something like that yeah it sounds like you're uh really into uh remodeling what you get yeah renovation renovation is kind of where we're at like our our favorite TV program is This Old House has been for many years yeah okay and we would like to get ahold of something really old and redo it uh um-hum there again we might go back out to Smithville and buy another home and because they're so it's a town that time has passed by so there are a lot of old big homes and they're fairly inexpensive oh yeah um-hum how far away from Austin is it so it's forty miles uh it's on the it's on the river and it's a quite nice little town they've been able to keep out a lot of businesses and things i mean there's no KMarts or anything like that around so oh yeah oh yeah makes it kind of nice ever are you um looking to get  hello how you doing i'm Lee with uh uh i'm over here in Plano Texas hello fine okay let me ask you something can i run a minute and shut my radio off okay oh sure oh okay where are you calling from or where are you at Arlington Arlington Texas yes Arlington well there's a lot of stuff going on in Arlington these days yes not all good stuff are you involved in any of that no no no i'm not not personally well uh what benefits uh do now do you work i'm going to school right now i can tell you about my last job or whatever you want to talk about that or my husband's or what i think i've got a lot of oh you are okay yeah because i i work for myself and so uh uh-huh uh there's a lot that i that i guess i do miss uh a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation i miss uh insurance and uh the steady paychecks that come but uh yes right yes yes i've been in my own business Mary Kay in fact i'm selling it out now to go to school for a turn and i enjoyed the freedom of having oh is that right that you know go to work when i wanted to and not but you know the benefits weren't there so uh-huh yeah i uh i own part of a roofing company oh do you yeah in the in the Dallas Fort Worth area uh-huh and uh you you know unfortunately we we were part of a of a bigger bigger company and they uh you know we we had all the benefits there and and i do miss that you know but uh on the other hand i uh-huh yeah i uh i enjoy having the the time that i have with my family and right yep um-hum being able to you know work when i want and i think today the thing that i uh would appreciate the most uh because my husband gets his medical through his company but we have to pay for mine uh-huh and we're the only one that i'm the only one that's being insured oh is that right and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children have i mean so it's kind of and i would i really and the way medical expenses are yeah it's a i think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to have you need to have yeah it really probably it yeah i'll tell you what that is the single most uh benefit that i that i right enjoyed and i do miss because i looked into picking up some uh medical insurance for my just for my family you know just and it is unbelievable how much you have to pay for it it's out of sight right it's out of sight and uh yeah even at a group rate i couldn't believe how much is our oh yeah even at a group rate uh it's it's unbelievable and uh the amount that you have to pay for you know for kids and and if you want to add dental to it i mean that's right it goes up right that eats even more so yeah i guess what the other benefits that uh that i uh that i miss i guess is uh you know some of the bonuses and stuff that that goes on with just being involved with a big company you know and course these days you can't count on that because um-hum right uh you know i feel bad for the people that are involved in that uh GM deal there in in Arlington and i'm i'm sure it'll be you know quite a few people are affected by that so right right it's going to hurt the city although uh i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank and i would see the GM people come in when they were they would shut down to retool uh-huh they were paid that whole time and i don't know if you're aware of this right yes oh really they come in there just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and every Friday and go to the safety deposit box and i'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know and they had all these great i i really believe they have done this to themselves is that right in a way because of the unions being so strong the Union yeah and right now anybody that's laid off from GM will have a full year's paycheck i just read this in the paper the other day plus probably an additional six months through the the worker's stuff that they have at is that right at uh through the company so i'm sorry you know i'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt but i don't feel as sorry for them if my husband were laid off tomorrow we'd get one more check and that would be it yeah well really the yeah really the ones it's gonna hurt is is actually the the businesses around in that area you know that's the ones that that that's going to hurt because they depend on that uh yes oh yeah that's already hurting yeah but i think there's a case where benefits have gotten they voted them in and they got so good i mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know oh yeah yeah and it made the prices of cars go up and um-hum and you know the i we i believe in unions but they went too far well i tell you i i've had my fill of unions i use i mean i can't make eighteen dollars an hour i mean i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour oh yeah  okay uh yeah Middle East and yeah uh well you know it's really ironic because it's just about a year ago today we were involved you know actively in that war that was going on at this time and uh yeah i guess last week was the uh anniversary of everything but uh uh-huh yeah yeah uh-huh that's that's one of those messed up areas i mean it's just uh-huh i i i think that the whole operation you know the idea of peace ever being achieved over there is just kind of a i don't know i mean that we're going to have peace you can have maybe some little more stability that what they have right now but um uh-huh it's just that's pure hatred between the Israelis and the uh Arabs i mean it's just i just don't think they can coexist i mean because they're not ever going to you know it's just too many problems that yeah well it it it certainly is not a an easy situation to deal with but uh i uh i i remember last year when the war was going on that i actually was uh if one can be in any way relieved when a war is going on but at least Israel listened to the uh admonitions of the United States about not retaliating uh when those missiles were dropped on them right and amazingly we we had those weapons that would counteract those missiles so that they would do a minimal of damage uh the whole thing was very amazing to me i don't think any any of it is right i mean we should be doing any of that stuff oh it's such an misuse of what we are as people but under the circumstances i could not help thinking that probably uh you know five or ten years ago i don't i don't even think that same kind of uh respect uh sufficiently for the United States would have been there that Israel wouldn't have just gone ahead you know uh like that uh Arafat and the and the the P L O and everything would just you know be so rambunctious as to just to retaliate and even even cause worse damage i oh it was a very terrible thing but uh it's uh uh-huh yeah i'm i'm amazed uh Israel didn't even uh uh-huh they did retaliate that that that's one of the most surprising things yeah yeah well i guess you know so long as our uh missile systems were holding out to counteract what was being thrown in and things seemed to be working i guess it's i'm uh but it's really worth trying for peace or at least coexistence like you said uh and they have actually gone to peace talks uh since the time of that war to try to hit some kind of a a common ground for coexistence uh yeah in fact Baker was uh a speech yesterday trying to get them back they're supposed to be going back to tables pretty soon the next week or two i guess but yeah uh-huh uh they'll you know they'll work out some type of an agreement and something will pop up in about five years and oh sure the fact that we never got uh Hussein out hopefully that will fall apart on its own in the next year or so but uh-huh i mean if he ever gets any type of military power back i mean for that area that's just going to be same situation again and uh-huh i don't know Bush um i just think should have gone in and just take take him out that would have that was a major problem yeah well it amazes me that the guy is still there yeah yeah is not around just him being just he's powerless but still the fact that he's still in power it's over there that's a symbol of very strange uh-huh he stood up to the evil force of the western world and i mean that's just completely different mode of thinking and you know yeah to them what they view view as reality is just simply opposite of what we view but yeah um so i it's i just i don't know the only thing that keeps us there is the oil and i guess the only good thing that came out of it is we would be paying twice as much more now for gas but oh well that's hopefully not the essential issue to mankind but uh i mean well it is for the money makers out there i guess but yeah uh-huh i don't know it's it's kind of hard for me to really yeah imagine i mean i've never even been over in that part of the world i had a friend of mine that got back and oh really yeah he's sort of there and he's just said that he just really he couldn't stand the the uh Saudis at all because he said they just didn't have any respect for them at all just mentality like oh really yeah they didn't he just really had a hard time you know oh i look at it as a he looked at it as a job he wasn't like uh-huh because he didn't like the people and no one did he said they just didn't they didn't want them over there the people they didn't like them and um you know they had all these rules you couldn't bring any type of religious artifacts in or oh that's right that's right any type of alcohol anything like that he's just yeah oh that that's in Arabia and they they have like this they look down at the soldiers the American soldiers and he said it's just um you have a hard time you know fighting for their cause yeah and to me to it's i don't know it's just it's just totally backward everything you know black is white and yeah white is black to them i mean that doesn't make sense but yeah well it makes you wonder how how  well why don't you tell me about your lawn and gardening oh let's see it hurts um i don't know i do quite a bit of it do you do you have a large lawn um pretty fairly fairly fair amount yeah yeah we switch plants here and there do you like to garden uh-huh well i like the yard to look nice but i can't say i really enjoy it oh really yeah no i've i've got other things that i like to do and that's that's not my favorite i don't know sweating out there sweating in the sun you know and pulling weeds and those stuff oh no no i don't like that no yeah no not that part just the pretty part yeah and i won't mow the lawn either and you know watering the lawn is a pain in the butt because we don't have a an electric system so yeah right right or sprinkler system i should say so yeah i like to get out in the morning yeah and that's it well what do you like to do when you garden oh mostly i like to keep a little garden oh so you actually grow vegetables right right right just like um salad salad vegetables that kind of thing well that's nice uh-huh and um that's about it just you know and shrubbery and everything and to keep the weeds down and stuff put mulch around it so you don't have to weed them yeah yeah you know i i find that gardening for me is just uh it it's expensive it really is you know you get into buying as many plants that you need to make it look good and you know you can't just buy two or three you've got to buy a dozen for one small area right right right you know so so it doesn't look it looks skimpy if you don't exactly and i know we've got this spring we've got to push pull a bunch of stumps out because they're they kicked the bucket so oh heaven well that means we'll just have to put something else and so but you know we haven't we hadn't had any freeze damage this year of course because it hasn't been that cold i guess it's been about the same with you all really right right i think it's only frozen um we've had a freeze twice yeah and i and it wasn't very bad and the rain is unbelievable i mean it's just right right did you get any snow we got a few a few flakes last week oh you're kidding really just enough to make it look you know i mean it didn't even of course settle you know on the ground but it looked pretty while it was coming down right well that's nice yeah what about you no none none not none whatsoever so some of the plants are still kind of growing along yeah uh-huh so that makes it nice that's true that's true ours are well they're they're kind of dormant they're pretty mellow right now yeah but soon it'll be time to go out and put some bulbs i get enthusiastic in the spring and then it kind of dies down yeah a little while later when you have to take care of everything in fact i just had a garden company come by and give me a well you know one of those places that fertilizes your lawn give me an estimate because i just don't want to go out and buy all the chemicals and stuff because because i don't know what you need for this weed versus this weed versus this weed right right right so i just let them treat all my weeds and i won't have to deal with you know buying this stuff and having it sit in the garage wow that's not bad well yeah it's better for us because we don't we have a pretty small lawn right so and and you know the cost i think per time is a little less than thirty bucks so do they get get rid of the ants and stuff like that i don't think they do the ants i think they're just dealing with the weeds oh oh not bad not bad at all though no because we've got a real problem they're overtaking everything so but i mean we got some good grass but it's getting you know um to the point where the weeds are taking over the grass exactly it's getting choked out oh my well i think we covered it don't you do you know anything else you want to talk about about gardening oh let's see i still have onions growing in the garden you you still have onions growing well they'll in Texas they'll go all year around oh and then if you want green onions you just go out there and grab some so so do you go uh give them away that you have so many no you use them pretty much yourself yeah well that's good yeah if you put them in all times of the year you can go out and take them you know for a green onion here and there and then if you have some left over they'll go to a a regular bulb onion and then you can have that the next um uh-huh the next time next next year yeah so the green onions the green onions grow into the the bigger onions yeah huh yeah they will if you let them alone and then you can put them anywhere sometimes i'll put mix them in with plants wow uh-huh just have a bunch of green here and there well you sound like somebody that needs to come to my house and do a little work but and then oh let's see and then um i put rye grass or my husband did put rye grass out this winter to make it look green uh-huh um right you put it around September November to make it look green uh-huh and that stuff fades away though right right when it starts getting hot um uh-huh it'll start dying down and your regular grass will come back in uh-huh so it doesn't cover i mean it it it doesn't compete with the regular grass or anything in the no no no no huh-uh it has real shallow roots everything but you got to get out and mow it it looks nice for a while and then it goes away and it kind of fertilizes the grass that's there all the time uh-huh  so uh do you work outside the home um i did until my company went bankrupt oh poor baby yeah now right now i haven't been able to locate a job down here in Patterson uh-huh it's kind of a small city so i've been going to Modesto which is larger but it's not like being in the Bay area where i came from uh-huh yeah you know uh-huh but anyhow when i did work in the winter time i wore uh my wool skirts and sweaters and boots um-hum because the Bay area gets kind of chilly in the winter time oh yeah and um then in the summer time i just wore you know the polyester blouses and usually usually pants and just uh heels you know um-hum yeah so uh where do you work at i work for a bank and uh i have to dress somewhat more formally oh okay right so i i look like the little old lady preppie you do you i don't suppose you can wear pants uh no i i guess i could but i don't oh because i never see anybody in the banks out here it seems like i never see them with pants on no no we don't wear pants uh i i wear suits uh-huh um-hum uh almost exclusively um-hum have you ever had a uh a color analysis no no i haven't uh well it's a very interesting process uh according to the lady that did mine she called them summer and winter uh-huh and uh spring and fall and the summer she said you could call them A B C D or one two three four or whatever uh-huh but there are people that look better in the cool colors than than the other people look better in the earth and warm colors uh-huh and uh most people are summers or winters and uh uh it's really an interesting process and i found out i was a summer so i look much better in the the blues pinks uh the the winters uh wear stronger colors but basically the same types of colors but as a summer i'm not supposed to wear uh black or stark white oh uh the winters just winters wear black and white and the summer uh the spring and and fall colors wear well i have a daughter in law that uh uh this the the camouflage colors the khakis and olive drab green uh-huh uh-huh just make her eyes light up like crazy yeah and then i i also have a daughter in law who has auburn hair oh really isn't that uh-huh so she wears the earth colors uh the oranges and the olive drab greens and the khakis and and uh they're most becoming to her so it it it really is an interesting uh-huh hum analysis yeah that would be interesting to do um i worked for a trucking company so we didn't really even have to dress up at all if we didn't want to we could wear pants all the time you know uh-huh but uh i just in the winter time i just like to wear boots and you know the wool skirts and the sweaters and everything yeah uh-huh but uh i've never gone to and had a you know uh-huh anything like that done to tell me exactly what color i would look best in yeah uh i know i don't look good in yellow but i like pink and blue you know and red uh-huh uh yeah uh-huh but uh i just look in the mirror and yeah well reds uh i i have to have a red that leans towards the the blue uh in other words it leans toward the maroon um-hum but the reds that lead lean toward the orange don't do a thing for me um-hum um-hum so i have to be careful about reds uh-huh huh very interesting so do you have your do you like do you in Dallas do you wear wool in the winter time or oh yeah oh yeah uh we have thirty nine an average of thirty nine days when it gets down below freezing and as a general rule at least oh uh-huh um-hum oh two or three days at a time during the winter we'll either have uh ice covered streets or two or three inches of snow um so uh i i wear woolens quite a bit um-hum and naturally it gets real hot in the summertime i suppose yeah oh yeah oh yeah it gets very warm in the summertime yeah yeah it gets hot here in Patterson in the summer time more so than it did in the Bay area you know um like here yeah yeah uh-huh are are you over toward Fresno uh like um a hundred and twenty six miles from Fresno uh south but in the valley north oh north oh i see i have not been i have not been north of of uh right uh what is it uh Interstate Eighty that goes from Sacramento to San Francisco right uh-huh i have not been north of that highway oh i see uh-huh so you have came to California though do you have family yes uh-huh  in dollars and lives and the long term effects uh-huh well uh you ready i i'll hit it if you're ready to start okay oh i'm ready yeah sure my name's Karen by the way what what's your name Karen my name's John Benyak where do you live San Francisco oh i live in Dallas oh nice to meet you just outside of Dallas nice talking to you what's that mean we're ready to go ready to go okay well it uh the way it turned out it wasn't worth anything really i just don't think i've always thought that uh it just wasn't carried on the way it should have been it wasn't carried on like a war i mean if we were in there to fight a war regardless of the reason we were there it should have been fought like a war it just uh what would that how would that have been different if it had been fought like a war we well i think we'd uh we'd uh beat them i don't think uh i don't know what would have happened twenty years later down the road with the country within and with us but uh i think if we'd uh had allowed the military people to conduct it like a war instead of letting the politicians and the and the peace and people like that dictate the terms of the way we fought i think things would have turned out a lot differently you you think it was a winnable war then oh yes yeah i mean it was just a two bit country always was and always will be and uh or at least it is now and there's no way that if we'd uh been able to take uh use the capacity that we had the potential we had to fight a war against a country like that we would have uh what would have lost it as a war the long term effects well uh-huh uh i don't know that's that's a little tougher to answer i think uh depends i guess on who's in office but uh i think Bush used that uh last year in the Persian Gulf uh by taking some stronger stronger measures and when the war started you mean the effects of of Vietnam being to encourage him to to be more defensive in his posture and go for be more or be more offensive well once the war started once they decided i meant offensive i'm sorry uh-huh once they decided to fight the thing we take a take a much uh run in there and do it as quickly as possible rather than let the thing drag on i guess what happened back in Vietnam is that uh they we escalated and uh just you know on a gradual basis and gave the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong time to adjust to our uh increases in uh personnel and so forth they just didn't go in there if they'd a sent five hundred thousand troops in there at one time initially uh i think things would have been would have been differently but different but it they went from having the advisors uh up to that four hundred to five hundred thousand troops over a period of time a long a long number of years and as i said i think the uh uh-huh the enemy just gradually adjusted to that um and they didn't uh the people the country the people here didn't want the war the way it turned out they didn't want it i do think one of the effects was that the uh people involved in that kind of an um activity were surprised at the power that the media had on um intervening and probably uh-huh set the tone for medias involved then in future whether it was a war activity or right something along those lines that are going to involve a number of people really right well there are everything changed after that in terms of media well there were every every night you'd come home from work and uh or school or whatever and see it on the uh the news i imagine that wasn't the case during World War Two or any of the other wars uh people just didn't feel like they had the involvement in it and there were a lot of uh-huh a lot of well you remember in the Gulf War they made a specific effort not to repeat the mistakes that the media they felt the media made in uh-huh Vietnam war they weren't about to have people in there reporting right right yeah but uh i just uh i i guess i was in my let's see my twenties during during most of that war and i i never did think that they were were doing it right i'm just not a uh a fan of Jane Fonda and people like her i mean that she'd go around speaking on different campuses and uh-huh getting people uh aroused about the whole thing and of course uh they always talked about the vocal minority and i guess that's what it was the solid majority and the vocal minority um people were listening to to her and i guess politicians were too but i just felt i was in the service at that time i wasn't over there but i just felt that they fought the thing i mean they just didn't fight it like they should have and it's a war whether a war is right or wrong you i mean if you're over there and uh-huh people or young people men or women are dying they ought to fight it as a war and either win or lose based on the fact that it's a war and not just uh uh mealy mouth their their way through the thing and try to get the other side to give up on the basis of what they thought we had in terms of power and so forth that approach probably would have shortened the time that we were over there too at least oh yeah it would sure shorten the time and reduce the number of casualties and so forth we might have lost i i i just don't think we could have lost uh-huh uh-huh  well how you doing i'm fine i want to know where you're from um i from um Plano Texas where how about you oh are you i i am too oh okay are you at the Christ United pardon are you in Christ United Methodist no um i i work for TI oh okay so that's how well okay well um anyway um i'm with a a choir and and we've been doing this as a fund raiser i wasn't sure if they were still doing it or not but i know that's not what we're supposed to talk about uh-huh okay i'm having dinner right now and and on the subject of food so just continue and you tell me something you'd like to tell me about food well are you are you having a Super Bowl party uh no i'm not actually i wish i were well i was thinking now that would be a good place to exchange a recipe maybe um uh-huh we're not having one this year either but um i'm going to one and this year it's pretty simple all i have to take is cheese so i know i don't even have to make anything but oh that's going to be easy oh well i guess my my favorite recipe that i've seen this week was fried green tomatoes did you see that in the paper no i didn't uh uh it's probably in reference to the movie i'm sure right right um i know my husband has heard about that and thought that that sounded really good are they i don't even i've never had fried tomatoes well you know i don't guess i have i mean i'm from Mississippi originally and surely you know i don't even know that i've ever seen it offered to tell you the truth and but this this evidently is a Southern delicacy that i didn't know about huh i didn't know about it either now we i have had um marinated green tomatoes you know where you marinate them with onions and cucumbers but i don't i've never had fried uh-huh uh-huh right well i tell you if you see that movie it'll make you want them fried green ones oh really oh yeah it just they just really make it look good now i love things like fried okra uh-huh and i try not to ever have fried things but still you know if i i think uh that the fried green tomatoes would be something like that are they pretty does it look like it's a pretty easy thing to make probably you probably bread them and and uh you know like with corn meal and that kind of thing and then uh-huh now i did i did go to a dinner this past weekend that was um fry them in grease at our church we had a church auction last fall and a lot of the things that were auctioned off were um services like a dinner for eight and then if you bought if you bought it uh-huh there were two couples that two or three couples that might cater the dinner uh-huh and one couple in our church had lived in the Philippines um years oh eight years ago and so they um auctioned off a Filipino dinner ooh nice and um so it was really fun one of the things that we had were was fried um bananas but but not fried bananas i don't know what they're called but it's a it's kind of looks like the dough that they use for egg rolls uh-huh i don't know what it's called but they put bananas in there and with cinnamon and i don't know what else and sugar and stuff and then they deep fry it and they use green bananas you know so that the bananas kind of stay together and i have fixed fried bananas before oh as a um Cuban or Spanish dish uh-huh you know and they're really really good but um when you were talking about fried tomatoes it reminded me of this the fried bananas that oh i bet that was good i know i would like that you know yeah it was really a fun a fun thing to do a fun way to raise money do you work um in any particular what particular what area do you work in i'm up at Spring Creek at Spring Creek in what what area uh-huh um manufacturing manufacturing because my husband is works for TI also oh really huh uh-huh he's at he's at Spring Creek but he's manager of what are you manager of honey telecommunications okay okay so he's in a different group uh-huh always it it's so funny you know his job is so complicated that i to me it's complicated that i never can exactly describe this to anybody yeah yeah i never can either i i mean i never can describe mine to my family or anything try to um i try to talk real real basic level when i get down to them uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well um now back to Fried Green Tomatoes you be sure and see that movie we saw it last Saturday and it was wonderful okay was it oh it really was is it a girl movie i mean is it is it something my husband would enjoy uh-huh well it's either one yeah uh-huh it it has it's a story that would appeal to both men and women uh Dave liked it a lot huh because he doesn't like going to see girly movies like like um Steel Magnolias he didn't want you know oh no now but my husband liked Steel Magnolias but it was more like this is more like Driving Miss Daisy did you see that and um and this probably is even a little more yeah yeah yeah masculine than than Driving Miss Daisy even but it's that kind of movie that has just a universal appeal okay yeah i mean like i have to rent Beaches and you know some of those other movies uh-huh  let's see um have you heard anything in particular about the universal health care system uh health insurance program that they're talking about well i haven't heard any of the specific details of uh what they have planned but uh basically the noise around Washington is that uh they're concerned that uh there's not enough health care insurance provided that uh very few families have uh health care insurance or any kind of uh coverage where they're employed yeah uh i'm not sure that there's any real plan afoot to uh bring a health care plan on line that requires everybody to kick in like uh Social Security yeah but uh one of the plan that's been circulated about is a requirement that employers provide uh health care insurance for their employees and kick in something like eighty percent of the cost of that insurance and uh if they don't do that then they have to pay into a federal fund that provides the uh health care insurance and it'd probably be cheaper to go ahead and pay a percentage of the local plan yeah uh-huh yeah especially for major corporations i tell you one thing that uh we were discussing this evening here that discourages me a little bit and worries me about the health care system uh i know that certainly in this region uh that the number of students graduating from dental school has been quite large yeah and a lot of the foreign students that uh came and stayed in this country didn't go back home yes so there's been a kind of dentists are kind of glut on the market and they're having a lot of trouble competing and making ends meet and uh physicians i think may be facing the same situation except they apparently have a very strong well organization and they are actually preventing students from entering medical college oh yeah they keep uh the AMA you've got to go through the AMA to get accepted into medical school yeah and they keep a tight rein on how many people get in uh-huh but uh now dental school that's yeah if they've got a glut on the market of dentists um i i i don't mean to be ugly about it but uh costs of dental work are pretty high yeah and if there's something i don't necessarily think it needs to be driven down again but to keep it from shooting up of course dentistry i don't think has near the problem with like malpractice insurance and such yeah that's probably the worst thing about health care right now is the unlimited capacity for suing for malpractice and uh-huh it seems to be the burden of proof that on the doctor that he didn't do something wrong rather than proving that he did and if he doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he did everything just right then suddenly he's got you know two or three years wages down the toilet but uh well i think that's sort of happened universally to all our industries i think our light plane industry went out of business because the uh cost of uh manufacturers' product liability was too high yeah uh but i think on the other side of the coin that uh maybe the AMA is being a little bit too protective of some of their physicians uh uh-huh yeah there are physicians getting away with murder yeah i've i've got my own set of war stories uh my daughter uh turns out she's allergic to gnats yeah and the first time i went in to have it treated it cost two thousand five hundred dollars and the second time i went to a different doctor and the doctor said oh she's allergic to gnats give her some Benadryl that was a two dollar and forty five cent treatment for it yeah and so uh you know four days in the hospital the children's ward on IV penicillin uh was a lot less effective than a couple of teaspoons full of Benadryl yeah and i have other friends that uh have really been misdiagnosed yes and i think it's probably a shame that there isn't more competition among doctors and there isn't a little more policing yeah uh of the results yeah uh from what i've seen the better physicians are quick to ask you to go ahead and get a second opinion yeah they're not feeling you know insulted they're it's like that's a little you know sweat off my brow simply because i mean you know they're they're covering their own tail legally and you know a second opinion  well have you taken any vacations that you enjoyed lately yes took one in October and uh drove flew into Los Angeles and drove up the coast to uh through Monterey and San Francisco and over to Lake Tahoe and flew out of Reno okay so you went up like the Coast Highway for a way and then then went inland there yeah uh-huh was really great is is that was that a new area for you to visit most of it was because i had uh seen parts of northern California and i'd been to San Francisco but never along the Coast Road yeah it was quite exciting yeah my husband said he didn't know whether he wanted to ever drive it again though it's the have you been it's scenic i guess i i've i've been to a part of that on a trip to San Francisco i i went up just a short ways up the coast to i believe it was Point Raid uh National Seashore i think it was um i don't remember that and i only had about a day so it was just a short drive up from San Francisco and back when i was out out for business oh well we went uh we liked Monterey very much and uh it was just kind of a relaxed pleasant town with a lot of things to see and do and and then uh the Muir Woods on the other side of San Francisco um that's another really bad drive but it's it's worth going to uh the the Redwood forest there yes what part of the country are you from originally from Texas i was raised up in Dalhart so uh anything that doesn't look like flat plains is uh like i told someone once i always thought Dallas was real green because it was the greenest place i'd ever been are you currently living in Texas oh yes live in Dallas okay see i'm in Texas too but where are you from where do you live in Richardson okay well you're just a a suburb of Dallas that's right well we uh my family and i moved here about three years ago we lived in Colorado and oh oh my uh and that's a good vacation spot too but it was nice living there yes yes well we uh when our children were young we used to go to Estes Park yes i i didn't live too far from there in fact i bicycled from my house to there a time or two uh oh how fortunate you were uh from Boulder i lived in Boulder Colorado yeah uh-huh that's that is one beautiful place uh i i uh didn't probably take advantage of it as much as i probably would if i moved back you kind of take it for granted when you live there but no yeah i did enjoy the skiing and and the and the winter sports that that was available there um well i've never skied my husband keeps saying we need to go but uh we have never done it yet but uh everyone who does says it's great yeah it's enjoyable if you do it more than once or twice so you get past the learning stage so you can start enjoying it it's a little bit frustrating when you're falling a lot but after after you get past that it's a lot of fun uh-huh you have to enjoy the cold snow in your face huh well it sometimes can be yeah it it uh you can get some nice days skiing as well though if if you're not falling you can stay pretty dry and uh-huh yeah and uh it can be pretty nice the dry climate doesn't feel near as cold as as it does here in the winter time to me yeah well i think that uh no the dampness course our humidity is sort of medium compared uh well where i was raised is extremely dry yeah but my brother lives in Houston and it's the the other extreme yeah so we're kind of in-between but uh my mother always said that Dallas was extremely humid to her yeah it's i i agree with you it's sort of in between yeah after having lived in Colorado a lot that was a little dryer than was probably comfortable it's a bit little too dry and uh-huh and this is actually a pretty good climate humidity wise in in the Dallas area uh-huh have you gone on any vacations lately last uh uh summer we uh we went uh and took the family to Cancun in Mexico and uh we really enjoyed that trip oh yeah have they uh we were we were there when it one of the first times it was open they were just building the hotels and well it's pretty built up now i was afraid it had become so commercialized yeah it probably was more enjoyable when you went before it was too too built it's it's a real strip hotel strip now out out on that island uh-huh did you go over to the Isle Mujeres uh yes we we took a sailboat uh catamaran ride over to Isle Mujeres and they took us around let us shop a little while and then took us to some snorkeling uh um yeah oh did you get to go out to that reef spot  well if you're from Iowa you must be very artsy-craftsy everyone i've ever known from the Midwest can do everything with their hands okay oh well actually i'm from California and before then i was from Utah so i didn't know anyone ever moved from California to Kansas Iowa well i grew up in California and then i went to school in Utah and i got married there and we stayed there for a while and then now we're in Utah Iowa i'm teasing only because i'm from Indiana i really liked i like the Midwest oh really oh but i married a Texan and they have a way of dragging you back home anyway we're supposed to be talking about crafts do you um do you have any hobbies that that you do things with your hands like knitting or um well i crochet and i do water color and i um sew and i do fabric painting oh you do a lot then do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching um i've done some cross stitching i haven't tried any needlepoint yet how about you um actually i i'm pretty untalented i used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting um oh right but i i don't know somehow i i don't have the time anymore but i have all these friends that wherever you go they they sit down and the next thing you know they pull out of their um bags some their most recent uh needle craft oh really and in December everyone was doing stockings you know these gorgeous detailed minute tiny stitch stockings uh-huh oh God oh yeah well those take a lot of time i only can do things that are pretty fast because yes we just um got our baby last year and i just don't have the patience to just you know be some uh-huh is this your first baby have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets um i crocheted an afghan for our bed that's the only thing and and i did a quilt let's see i've done a quilt for our baby and i've done a quilt for our bed but i mean did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself or um how how did you make a quilt um our baby's quilt it was a pre like the design i just went around the design in the quilt i didn't piece it or anything like that uh-huh but uh but you actually hand quilted it yourself uh-huh and just did did you need a loom or were you able was it small enough that you could just hold it um i put it on the frame the quilting frame have you are you familiar with that yeah okay uh-huh but um my again my mother back in Indiana we had a quilting frame in our basement and she would she would quilt whole quilts by herself oh my God um yes which i was always amazed i have one of them um but uh you know to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it's a tremendous amount of work well i haven't done tons of them but um i used to do more before um before i had before we got our baby but have you think children you can um use crafts to make wonderful things for children uh-huh i think when babies i think afghans and and the crocheted little sweaters and are are wonderful and and they'll wear them once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear your yeah exactly well one thing that i like about this fabric painting thing is i can just make a T-shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then um cut out a little pattern from the material from some material like flowers or something and make um a design or you know a little arrangement or something on the shirt and you know fuse it on with Heat and Bond or whatever and then paint around it and i usually sew sew around the flower whatever first and then i paint around it so you can't see the stitching as much does does that make sense to you oh yes i think it's very clever it's uh funny that you said for Christmas my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for ours a beautiful Christmas design and they were matching and they were lovely so oh but when i washed them although i took the precaution of turning them inside out i really didn't do anything else and truly everything fell off or most of it so i had i went and bought just some oh sure uh-huh oh really cloth glue and glued it all back and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges and and it was salvageable and i oh but it's so i'm familiar with that but i think you're very clever to um sew around the edges i think gluing alone certainly if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges well yeah someone told me that that it that they had done it both ways and i've always after hearing that i always sewed it on even even with the uh a loose zigzag even helps and um  hey Larry what is the last home repair job you did yes sir well uh you mean that i did or had done had the either one either one well actually um this whole past summer i've had my old outside of my house repainted and a lot of the little minor wood things corrected um-hum you and just prior to that i had a a bathroom totally remodeled and rebuilt and uh so i've i'm bringing my house up-to-date really how old is your house we built the house in nineteen sixty well that's not that old of a house but things do change from time to time don't they no that's right they they they do change and and the bathrooms you know if you have any water leakage anywhere can uh slowly deteriorate things and so you got to plug those leaks up y'all have basements in Pennsylvania don't you um-hum we don't have basements in Texas unless it's an unusual a very unusual situation is that right well is the water level high there uh no we build them on pier and beams as they up for few years back and then what's popular now is just called a slab um-hum and we don't have snow to speak of oh well we just got about a an inch inch and a half last night if it snows in Dallas we won't we don't go to work and wait for it to melt and at lunch we have the day off you know it i'm serious we just we don't have any snow plows oh i see i declare uh the last home project i guess well a year and a half ago we bought a house that had laid vacant for about two years and had been well sad situation estate thing and we've kind of put the whole thing back together uh the biggest thing i did was uh refenced and redecked in the back um-hum oh i see are you doing this yourself are you kidding i'd rather sell an extra insurance policy than use a hammer and a nail it wouldn't be straight anyway i declare oh well uh let's see and we we found a part time fireman and policeman and in their so so called spare time they moonlight um-hum uh-huh and we get a lot better price than trying to use a professional yellow page advertised uh that's true these lot of fellows uh uh really really want to work pretty hard so they willing to come at little bit more reasonable prices i'm sure of that i just had some guttering also replaced on my home personnel um-hum uh i actually replaced all the other guttering last year and and the piece that i did this year seemed all right at the time so i left it alone have you heard of that continuous guttering they have now that's what i put up this last time it's one solid piece about thirty feet long no kidding were you were you happy did they make it right there on your property no it was uh brought out on a truck oh okay so i i it was it i have seen these things done they uh they come on great big large wheels i think of material and they roll it off i haven't seen it done when we moved into the uh the house we we got guttering bids we finally repaired briefly what we've got for less than a hundred bucks those guys were gonna sell me a three thousand go ahead and uh they talked about bringing a machine out and just making it right there in the front yard and putting it up as they make it so i've never seen one yeah well this as i say this was already uh they had come out and measured it and brought out the two pieces at the correct length and all they had to do is mount them and then uh seal one joint where the two ends came together i just thought of a project i did my wife wanted an island in the kitchen um-hum well we the house isn't that new so i built a uh a uh a table um-hum from the local hardware store we have a outfit called Home Depot which is probably local down here but i ordered a Formica top with rounded corners um-hum uh-huh and then they have premade and bevelled uh legs and braces and so i simply took my counter top and put legs on it and braces and and uh put it together and uh worked all right huh for and it worked just fine it was premeasured the legs were premeasured exactly the same length so it's level hold it i have to put two business cards underneath it that's pretty damn close for an amateur that's very very close i uh as they say down south you done good yeah had somebody come through and he said my gosh if you had bought that at a store it'd been seven hundred and fifty dollars and i got out for about a hundred and forty five i think yeah well that sounds great so i was happy yeah well i've got this uh the we were talking earlier about my house i've got one more bathroom to rebuild and uh um-hum we also have a a a porch that extends out from our master bedroom that we want to rebuild it's uh taken a beating over the years and um now we're a little afraid to walk out on it because some of the wood is deteriorating how nice are y'all in the mountains uh we're in between the mountains we're we're in uh what we're called Nitny Valley at Penn State i  um Lee what advice do you have for someone choosing a college well uh as a former uh professor in a university and having been through college uh and graduate school myself i guess my own um advice would be to first try to assess the needs of the the kid um some kids do very well in large universities and other kids do very well in junior colleges and other kids do very well in residential college environments um and i think it really depends upon the individual the safest bet for most people who want uh uh a good quality experience is a private college where they're gonna get an opportunity to have more personal contact and uh where they're going to be forced by the circumstances to learn more than might be the case in a big university uh-huh did you go to a private college for your undergraduate no i went to a big university i went um i went to Pitt as an undergraduate and i looked at small colleges and frankly um i think i had this sense that it would have been more difficult at small colleges and i think it would would have been definitely i mean i i graduated Phi Beta Kappa summa cum laude and went on to do a PhD and i think that uh had i gone to a small college i might have learned a lot more but i don't think my grades would have been nearly as good uh-huh i think you can get away with more in a big uh a big university uh what what kind of experience have you had in this regard well um i went to a private university although it was a large private university it was Bringham Young University in Utah and that's uh has about twenty seven thousand students uh-huh that's big yeah so it's it's pretty big but i enjoyed my experience there one thing i was thinking about this topic is um i would try and get a lot of input from from other students who had gone to the college in the particular program and see how they liked it for example i made well i had a bad experience in graduate school and i think i would never have gone to the place had i have went and visited the place and talked to some of the students who were currently in the program for example i um started graduate school um oh yeah in well i don't know if i should give specific names but uh it was well that's all right go ahead um it was just in a physics program back east and um well it happened to be in Pittsburgh it was the University it was Carnegie Melon University and uh-huh the teaching assistantship situation just was not very good it turned out that um there were six new teaching assistants from the US who went we all quit after our first year of graduate school um no kidding it turned out that the undergraduates had thrown a big fit the several years before that they weren't learning from the foreign TAs and they had six new students from foreign TAs TAs also but the foreign TAs could not teach the classes and so there was a huge teaching burden on us the US um um-hum right TAs and so it's we were really bogged down and yeah what i think is one of the problems with with a kid going to a large university generally and this happens at Stanford at Cal out here i i think that the the residential college experience is generally the best for most kids some kids are particularly pardon me you mean community college type or you mean by residential college do you mean well i mean uh let me let me give you an example of a college that would fit that description um i would say that uh some of the best colleges in the country are small residential colleges like Swarthmore College like um Amherst Wesleyan Williams College oh i see oh um those are places that that in academia are generally regarded as the best places to get liberal arts educations on the other hand you can go to a big university and do very well and some big universities i don't know whether Bringham Young is like this but some have a small college feel to them you don't get a lot of foreign TAs you i mean in other words that the people who teach really know how to teach oh yeah and i think that's what important for a lot of kids uh in my case i went through uh between sixty eight and seventy two in college and it was just this big uh grade game for me and i learned some things and i just luckily stumbled in the right area um but i was years out of graduate school i had worked in industry before i ever came back and wanted to use my training as a scientist to um you know to get anything done and as matter of fact i'm i'm working on a book and a theory uh which has its foundations ultimately in theoretical physics and i'd never would have imagined myself wanting to do something like that i had such a negative  our topic today uh yeah something about the school system here right and now i'm sort of don't know if this an advantage or disadvantage my wife's a school teacher so well then i'll uh i'll walk softly no you go right ahead because i have a lot of strong opinions on it too my wife teaches seventh grade and you know there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system i think the i don't think the teachers get enough support quite honestly but uh yeah for example my wife she has kids that are on drugs and course like everyone she has kids that get pregnant even even in the seventh grade what school system does she teach in Plano School System but but to give you an example uh oh wow you know one of her kids will come in and he's you could tell he's just bombed out on drugs and uh she sends him to the principal's office and the principal sends him right back or her right back and says hey your problem you take care of it you're not allowed to send them home you know if you do that then your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever your you you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day and just it's it's a numbers game i don't think that's right if they're especially if they're interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning well i think it's more of a there's a bigger problem here than uh than discipline in the schools i think it gets back to the uh parental uh participation into the program yes um to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District and it's a public system however you'd think that it was a private school because they've taken it the best teachers and the best students they've taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district and uh put them in this academy system and to get into the system's very difficult but once you're in uh they have they have self-paced programs and so you have students that wanna learn and uh you have teachers that wanna teach and you have parents that are really interested in the children and basically uh there's probably some discrimination if you wanna say that uh because most of the people that are in the academy system sure uh are Caucasian and because you have to test into the system sure and most of that's not all true but i'm saying a large percentage of them are and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about of these kids uh have college degrees at least one parent does and so there's i think that uh that's my justification for saying that the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they don't know what their children are learning they're they're saying do your homework let me see it don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you oh yeah my son had such a tough time in uh the school he went to but there was through it wasn't all the school's fault it was his fault also but we put him in a private school in Richardson and that that cost more that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters that was more than his college tuition was yeah but uh had to be done at least it took care of him and uh threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and uh want to learn something but i'll tell you what there's a there there are a few faults to say the least in the school systems today yeah i think what we've done is um um especially looking at um the South Dallas area is that we're trying to bring the education level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed yeah i think we have that problem dealing in most areas which is unfortunate and um that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you're not don't have the proper education uh including uh exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do you bet database management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job uh you can't function you bet you know so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world and the business world then says we're not going to pay you well it's different unless you have the education and then education and then then we what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself sure well teachers you know they have a a tough row to hoe so to speak they just are always fighting the system i don't know if it's better than any you know we came down to Texas from the uh New York area we were only there for a short time but my wife is from New York and she was born and raised there and educated there college and everything and i think you know the schools in the east are really a lot better than the schools in the south i don't care where you're from and they they i don't know if they learn more but they certainly uh they have a tendency to learn more and in that part of the country there is all nationalities  uh what kind of lawn and garden work do you wind up doing i have um we own a house that we rent out um-hum okay and i i rent the house that i live in okay and the house that i'm renting the house that i live in had the landlord provides the yard work okay the house that we own i provide the yard work okay this sounds kind of like slightly jumbled situation there i know well the the one that i live in is not nearly so nice as the one i rent out though uh that good income huh i wanna preserve the the the value of the house by making sure the yard is taken care of yes okay so i i go over to my other house and mow the yard and plant bulbs and flowers and yes do do you enjoy gardening i adore it yeah it's real relaxation um-hum uh my father ran a service station for thirty nine years and his um-hum i mean when when i was a kid i didn't realize how true it was but he always said that that was the best way he knew of to wind to wind down after a hard day at work was to come home and put in a hard day in the garden yeah and especially you know just hoeing just hoeing up the weeds it was therapy to him um-hum and i guess it still is but uh and i didn't seem that way when i was like ten years old but did you mow the yard when you were younger or do stuff like that oh yeah yeah um we had about a quarter of an acre worth of lawn between our my my parents' house and our next door neighbor ooh um-hum they were a rather elderly couple so we cut their lawn for them but uh there's about a half acre worth of garden we kept so when the kids and dad we we kept it worked up pretty well it was a lot of fun as long as you know your heart was in it at least least to some extent or another do you still do yard work well uh since i moved away from home i got to live in a place that had a yard oh so i not really do you do anything anything like um uh house plants or yes we've actually gotten to the point where uh for a while i couldn't seem to keep anything alive um-hum i couldn't even grow weeds in the house but about three years ago my wife and i somehow another seemed to have turned into green thumbs we got we pinched off a uh a couple couple of a twigs from a house plant of her mother's um-hum oh gosh and wrapped them in a wet paper towel and brought them home with us uh-huh and put them in a jar of Miracle Grow and water and these this thing took off and we planted them and now it's a plant uh plant we pinched them off of was kind of full and leafy but it was only about uh-huh eight inches high off the top of the pot this thing's about five feet tall now uh-huh ooh what is it and i don't know it it's this you know some little broad leaf something or other we but uh it's it's got real thick thick stalks to it that like i say it's the couple of those stalks over five feet tall but uh they're just growing like mad once we got that thing going we wound up with about five or six other house plants that are all doing real well some people gave us some aloe vera and it oh um-hum it's doing well i mean it's had it's bad spots but i killed an aloe vera uh it's had its rough times but yeah but it's it's doing real well now um um-hum i brought her a uh a couple of i don't even know what they're called looks like overly large lawn grass but it just a broad leaf type of along net kind of like a a leaf on a stalk of corn but greener it's um-hum um-hum oh yeah um corn plants those are called corn plants or or Dracaena or they're some kind of Dracaena but common name's corn plants i think short house plant pardon yeah well it doesn't get a stalk the the leaves all come out of the center it doesn't really resemble corn other than the shape of the leaf itself it is about like the shape of a leaf a leaf on a stalk of corn but it's not on a oh oh huh um-hum stalk it's just all out of the center huh that's i don't i know i have one of those that's not doing very well but i think i know what you're talking about yeah and uh it doesn't seem to flower any and let's see we've got a little somebody gave us a Fichus and uh uh when we first got it no well we came close we got really close you you haven't killed it um when we first got it she kept moving it back and forth from our own front porch to the uh inside and she never could quite decide where she wanted it inside um-hum um-hum and it had shed almost all its leaves it looked really scraggly and rough and when somebody finally told us the only way to treat those things is to put them some place and leave them um-hum  do you think do we spend enough on that or uh probably not from what i've been hearing i mean there's not enough getting done oh yeah uh-huh yeah i just kind of wonder uh you know i've been thinking i don't know how much they spend on cancer and how much they spend on AIDS and some of those other things but it seems like uh you know it needs to be somewhat equitable i guess as far as the number of people that are affected uh cancer seems to affect a lot more people and you'd think they need to spend more on that but yeah well you think this AIDS thing has been around since about nineteen eighty and yeah i would have thought by now they'd have been a lot more advances yeah in treatment and then again i guess there is i mean there's some drugs that they didn't have and uh-huh i'm sure that didn't come cheap yeah that's true it's uh i don't know it's kind of interesting issue you wonder now it's gotten so out of hand that you know it's not just that the homosexual population and stuff like that uh you know it's affected everybody just even if you go to a hospital it's kind of hard to know what to do and yeah you really i don't even think they really a decent idea of how many people really have it i it's pretty uh i would imagine a lot more people have it than they think and yeah i keep thinking that myself it's kind of a scary i i was last year when the war thing was going on and it was over and they said it costed you know like seventy billion or something uh-huh and they said if they had that much money for AIDS research they could have found found a cure uh-huh so i kind of wondered about that yeah wait whether amongst to me that's an astronomical amount of money and uh yeah seventy and uh but it suddenly comes from somewhere i don't know where it comes from but yeah and you just wonder i you know i look at kind of now too where we're getting all this people asking us for aid outside the country you know or to support the Soviet Union this that and the other and you know i sometimes wonder if it's not time we started you know maybe turning some of that stuff back towards home and helping some of those problems and you know AIDS being one of them to yeah i think didn't the President put i don't know if it was a billion or so more dollars or something in the budget this well i guess it was in ninety one to try and find a cure for it or there again that doesn't seem like a whole lot of money uh-huh you know if to do something like that with yeah uh but i i kind of agree with you we should spend more in this country for not only AIDS but a lot of other things before we start helping other countries yeah yeah it's kind of kind of ironic ourselves we're on the down trend and here we are trying to still pick other people up and yeah seems like that's all we ever do and it comes back to haunt us in the long run yeah but i mean in in in your own financial budget if if you're not doing well you're not going to help out anyone else yeah yeah that's true i mean that you might that you want to try and be charitable but yet you got to take care of your own house and put your own house in order before you start dishing out to everybody else and but but that's not the way this country is or ever been i think we've always yeah i they had reasons for it i think i heard one just the other day that because of all the money he was you know giving away right now uh the president was i think his wife said something with well we've got to keep these countries in a democratic mode and uh-huh uh-huh uh sometimes i don't think it matters no and and yeah i i i agree that just and and like i say what do we really get out of it a lot of times you know i guess if we didn't help the Soviet Union there could be just total chaos and go back to the old order but you know we're either paying for it in weapons and arms or we're paying we're giving it to them for nothing you know yeah and then we you know at least we have jobs when we're making all the weapons and stuff it seemed like and now we don't even have those because we cut back so much and then we give it away and you just wonder what we really get out of it my wife and i used to work at a research laboratory for the government uh-huh and i know things go slow yeah an incredible amount of money is spent to achieve little or nothing sometimes uh-huh so i understand you know where the money gets ate up at and but there really should just be more more money spent and now that yeah and now that they're you know the weapon spending is going down uh-huh but we could put some of these laboratories even like the one we worked at at Los Alamos put them onto you know more AIDS things uh-huh yeah well uh do you know that much about i mean have you ever met anybody that has AIDS or not that i know of yeah i've never met anybody myself but i think that where we used to live we had a neighbor down the street and i heard a rumor that one of them died with AIDS uh-huh uh-huh but i never knew for sure i met them once or twice because they used to sell plants in the yard but uh-huh i never really considered that i knew them so yeah just more passing but yeah yeah i just i haven't had anything strike home so it really hasn't hit me as bad as some you know you tend to sometimes wonder well hey you know you kind of brought it on yourself but like i say now it's getting so much more in into society that people that you know have no intention of doing anything you know kind of end up with it and you know little kids and stuff like that that yeah that is it's and i say i don't have any idea how much and there ought to be probably a lot more spent to to find out i just i just hope they kind of keep things in perspective and remember there's a bunch of other you know type diseases out there it seems you hear a lot more about the AIDS activists than you do these other people with these other diseases and actually  all right i guess this is a great time to talk about fitness with everybody and their New Year's resolutions and going out and getting their recor regular exercise program um do you recor exercise regularly yeah uh uh yes i do uh and tell me about that if you would well unfortunately i have a cholesterol problem and uh i for a long time i did aerobics uh-huh yes but a couple of years ago my uh doctor says no don't do aerobics any more ride the stationary bicycle so that that's what i do for thirty minutes a day i average six days a week wow well that's great that's fantastic do you have that set up where you can uh listen to some music or read a book or you just uh go yeah oh definitely oh definitely uh it's it's boring well good so you're good you're using it yes because you don't see a whole lot on a stationary bike no no uh and i i also belong to uh the Texas Club and uh so some days i uh i go over there and i work out with the the Nautilus weights yeah oh okay um-hum well uh my goal is uh three days a week but usually it boils down to about one day a week yes yes uh do you have a regular regimen well you've got me at a disadvantage i do not have a regular regiment i do exercise periodically but it's whenever i have the time i uh i have a problem in that i don't make the time and i i understand the importance of it and in fact when i was in high school and college i was um-hum um-hum on all sorts of athletic teams and and regular programs but since i've gotten into a new job and into my uh career um-hum and into a young family time seems to escape me right now but uh one thing that i really enjoy um yeah is that uh i have bicycles and i have two older boys that they like to ride bicycles with me and we ride as a family um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah oh that's wonderful and you know uh i actually live in Plano but i'm working here in Dallas and they have some excellent bike paths um where you can go and ride for miles and miles and days and days and not see the same scenery twice which is really fun um um-hum oh yeah and uh one thing that i've been doing also is that mind you it's not regularly but uh i like to go out and go jogging and i do that and the boys get on their bikes and uh we we um-hum um-hum they ride along and i jog along and it's a nice time to spend some some time with the boys too so i'm trying to coordinate um-hum you know my family time in conjunction with my exercise time exercise program and uh we really seem to enjoy that oh yeah that's extremely important and uh there there's a couple of reasons for that is my boys are very sports minded even at their young age and uh one of them 's in soccer and the other one just loves to do it um-hum um-hum um-hum and so we get out and and do this and it i found out that it's very helpful to them also in my oldest boy's soccer league that uh he doesn't seem to run out of breath as much as the other boys do and um-hum he can stay in longer oh yeah and uh and uh so i i don't have a a regular one but i i really would like to set my priorities straight i guess and and set aside time to do that um-hum i thought of different things i thought about going at the same time every day in the morning if i am generally uh getting up and heading off to work around six or six thirty um-hum which means i'd have to get up way early in the morning in the wee hours of the morning to do that and uh i've also tried to set aside time in the afternoon or evening yeah but uh things generally pop up that precru preclude me from from doing that so i just need to get into a habit um-hum yeah there's a a program on in the afternoons on channel two at four o'clock do you have a VCR um-hum uh yes i do uh you might record it and play it later now it's just uh oh stretch and tone it's not aerobics um-hum oh okay uh but it's called body electric and it's a a lady broadcasting from Florida and uh it's for thirty minutes it comes on uh um-hum five days a week and uh it it it's a really good supplement to your bike riding well great um-hum uh it helps with flexibility and uh for uh for some of the exercises she uses three pound weights oh okay but uh she's not a a a great weight person but uh sometimes for the uh upper arms and deltoids and well uh back muscles she uses these three pound weights um-hum um-hum so well that's that's good that's one thing that i'd and the weights i'd kind of like to get away from because in high school and college i lifted an awful lot of weights and that immediately uh-huh  well what do you think about your everyday occurrences that are that are an invasion of your privacy uh well the uh what i really i don't like is the call the constant calls people selling things people telling me i won things oh right you know people trying to solicit for different you know organizations now that's what i really yeah i think that that's the only thing i wrote down also because that's just a it's terrible today i mean my wife and i it seems like i get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing and and it rings up until ten and eleven o'clock sometimes never stops ringing right that's right well you know the the great uh things of that its a is is an answering machine i mean this is this is the one of the best inventions ever you know you just switch that thing on and uh yes i know that's true yeah that's true yeah but you know people it's like your name must be on a list or something because i know at my office i get calls i mean i must get at least i probably average at least a call a day and and a lot a days i'll get to and three calls from hum even in an office from people selling insurance you know to the small business man uh-huh right and uh you know i think Dunn and Bradstreet puts your according to what i've understand Dunn and Bradstreet puts your names your name out to people also as far as brokers all i get calls from brokers in New York and uh um-hum California always trying to sell something oil oil investments or stock investments or whatever right right and now i getting the same calls at at the house um-hum i know and they get your and they get your name from Dunn and Bradstreet and uh credit card companies they sell your name oh yeah uh well you know these people they sell your names i mean you know i that's also an invasion of privacy i think if the whole thing is a i know yes American Express does that by the way oh they do yeah i understand they sell their you know they sell names because it's quite profitable to them well sure it is and uh that is an invasion of privacy you're right that's right well you know if you've ever gotten anything you know in your life your your name is somewhere i mean one magazine and boom they got your name forever i know that's true exactly magazine companies uh from from subscriptions do the same thing it's the way they make additional money um-hum that's right but it's uh you know i guess it uh you have to be a certain income holder to uh have an American Express card so your name is valuable to i guess X amount of solicitors calling yeah that's right so i don't know but where where do you where you from oh i'm from Texas oh okay well so yeah we live in the Dallas area Richardson oh well we're in Plano okay laughter well you know the only call i really got that well was out of state i got one from Oklahoma City and one from California did you and that was uh California i was thrilled to death because that's the you know the furthest i'd gotten any call from you know and um yeah i've got i talked to people in Utah people in New York and a lot of times i'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning and i'll get people you know from out of the uh out of the state oh really oh yeah see well that's uh that there was another call on Saturday Saturday that was also from uh that was the one from California i don't know why i guess people on the weekends from out of state will uh i don't know you know but i'll be darn where you from not from Texas uh originally from New Jersey New Jersey right yeah my wife's from New Jersey yeah oh really what part yeah from Saddle River oh that's nice over there yeah we're from more uh from sort of towards the shore central New Jersey you know we're like uh she okay well that's nice too yeah oh yeah it was beautiful that's why i i really miss it i i don't really like it here at all really yes my wife's been away since we've been married twenty five years so she she's been away for quite a while uh-huh her dad was from Little Rock Arkansas and her mother was from New York so they just yeah so their they officed over there in New Jersey yeah so but anyway yeah this topic is it's a good topic as far as invasion of your privacy but that's the the biggest one i can think of is just all the solicitors calling well yeah i mean yeah yeah and i know of course they call and you know before i got the answering machine it was ridiculous you know i said this is absurd i the you know i the the minute i get home the phone would be ringing uh i know that's a that's a good suggestion i might start using the answering machine more because you know it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings oh it's great i mean well you know in fact i've been missing calls from the TI switchboard because i i always have it on you know and i'll get that that that message that says uh uh to to uh um right uh you uh know end this call press three and i assumed i you know was from the switchboard you know yeah it is because one day i listened you know and it was sure you yeah you're probably right you know but um i i just got totally disgusted and and you know people asking for for money for everything you know i mean it i understand i mean i it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriff's association and exactly and you know the policeman's association and i know they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival carnival or circus and then oh i used to do that yeah i used to do that i'd say or three kids to the movies or something right there's always a different and i my my pat answer now is well you just called me the other night  i assume most of the books you're reading these days since you're a student have to do with studies yeah yeah that's about all i get a chance for between that and um uh Bible study as often as i can that's about the bulk of it the uh not a whole lot of chances otherwise what year are you in in computer science okay um officially a junior right now um yeah and so the course work you're doing is what well right now i'm taking a a uh my fourth semester of of electronics dealing mostly with uh uh MOSFET and JFET transistors i thought you said computer science was your major and well okay they they're are gonna uh computer engineering oh computer engineering okay that's yeah okay okay i am getting some programming right right now i'm taking my first semester in in well no no i actually i'm an engineer by training and uh i it is my impression that's easier for an engineer to learn about computers than it is for a computer science person to learn about computers yeah yeah well with this well they classify it as computer engineering technology so i'm getting a fair amount of programming as well as electronics yeah um-hum right so who's books do you use for programming uh it depends on which language they're working with um well tell me what language we're taking these days right now i'm taking C i've got three semesters in Pascal behind me taking C okay is that just standard C or C plus plus uh that we're working with what what they called standard uh ANSI C yes right um-hum um i'm not real sure what the difference is gonna be between C and C well C plus plus is object oriented and there is uh quite a bit of difference and it quite often has you need a book up front to tell you about uh precompiling and that sort of thing and then it normally does a little shuffle up front yeah um-hum and then runs on ANSI C or some other similar dialect of C so it does uh some preprocessing to begin with who's book do you use in Pascal okay well what we're working with is uh i don't remember the author's name well how we going to talk about books well maybe we better switch to pleasure then uh what do you read for pleasure used to be i read a good deal of uh science fiction so Isaac Asimov for example um Asimov um Clark uh yeah Arthur Clark there's uh the big one was Asimov his he's his stuff was easiest to find yeah yeah what got me started in the first place was uh my brother-in-law gave me a set the uh um Foundation Trilogy oh yeah that's fantastic back junior a year and a when i was a in in junior high school he gave it to me oh yeah it's hard to put down those oh yeah and he's come up with what three more books have you ever read Asimov's I Robot uh parts of it i got three parts of it i tell you that that is hilarious some parts of that you know the the one i yeah yeah wait a minute matter of fact i did read i i Robot i have actually gone back and is is long enough that was the first science fiction book i ever read was I Robot I Robot yeah that's pretty light reading for science fiction those kind of things and it and it was so good i went back and read it again because Asimov knows how to string things together you know yes he does well the uh Foundation Trilogy is directly connected to I Robot yeah oh yeah right as a matter of fact his last book Foundation and Earth um-hum um-hum they made the finally made the connection uh that uh um leader robot whatever his i don't remember his name now i can't remember the name either but anyway he's still going in the Foundation at the uh in Foundation and Earth they meet up with him uh huh i'll be darned he's on a base on the moon and somehow or another earth has been so utterly polluted with uh uh uh radioactive fallout that it's utterly inhabitable uninhabitable even though it's been several million years right oh yeah uh several hundred thousand years anyway yeah so it's it's utterly uninhabitable well while i was working i got enough i read on the job a lot of course just like a student does because you're learning all the time in research so i read oh yeah yeah i uh started uh long enough ago that uh vacuum tubes were still in business when i was a young engineer you know so i had to continually upgrade my education and yeah that was really good for me because that's what i'd like to do anyway i'd like to be a permanent student you know so uh yeah yeah yeah well i i got started on student late i was thirty three when i started to college for the first time yeah so you knew what you wanted to do yeah yeah oh yeah yeah i'd i'd been an auto mechanic for twenty years right started about twelve years old for my father but uh decided you know i i had a pretty good idea that wasn't what i wanted to do any more yeah yeah have you been in the military at all no didn't go through military um oh so probably so probably the things that i enjoy reading relative to military you would enjoy The Web Web Griffin stuff uh which uh has to do with the military and other right wing things uh uh not familiar with it  okay i pushed it okay so what do you do in your lawn do you do it yourself or do you hire someone to do it uh no we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time uh find that it's really a little more economical and we have or i found that i have the time and i kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas i used to live in Arizona and it was very confusing very frustrating because i didn't have the watering system and it was it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment but over here we get enough water automatically you know naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers and so it's a lot more rewarding uh-huh um-hum yeah right uh-huh uh-huh so well we do our own out here of there you know mow it ourselves and everything but um our water supply right now is bad we need rain badly oh that's right uh we can water here and Patterson i can water on Tuesdays Thursdays Saturday and Sunday four days a week um-hum is is that enough during the hotter times of the year so it was this last summer yeah um-hum uh now if it we don't get some rain they might limit it to not even four times you know yeah yeah but um yeah we do our lawn our you know mowing ourselves and everything and i do our planting of bulbs and things for i can have some spring flowers um-hum and uh yeah i i find that i've been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before and um-hum and it's been real enjoyable although i didn't do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold um they'd freeze down and by the time they the flowers would um-hum come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting oh so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of uh more of a problem than it was rewarding so um-hum um-hum um i'm gonna try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that yeah yeah we have quite a few roses i just uh we in fact we just pruned them uh way down and i uh just uh uh had to replace on of them so i just bought that yesterday and uh probably go outside today and plant that you know feels um-hum but um i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long yeah those are enjoyable i even had uh roses on my table for Christmas dinner oh did you which was really pretty you know but um other than the roses i don't have too many flowers i plant gladiolas um-hum um those are nice and those are always pretty but they get so tall and they they bend over so fast uh-huh you know yeah yeah i haven't done much in in bulbs in fact i received as a Christmas present a a a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water at any time and and after it started to sprout put in sunny window and it's it just grew like crazy but i don't have any flowers on it i don't know how long that takes or if there's anything i need to differently but um-hum hum it's just nice and green right now um-hum well is it that one of those Amaryllis uh no i'm thinking white narcissus or something like a paper white paper flower or something no huh oh okay uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and uh so i don't know do you have a big yard no not really and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas uh they have just the the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard we have a pool in our backyard and we did plan it to where we have um-hum some some play yard last over but it's it's um you know very small but most of the houses here if you have a pool you don't have anything else in the backyard that's that's about the size of most of them um-hum yeah right right um-hum um-hum so um i guess we're kind of fortunate everyone looks at that with our yard at our yard with kind of a sense of awe like wow you really got you know some grass back there um um-hum um-hum um-hum well that makes it nice and yeah well it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool but we don't have one um-hum you know but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know but we just we just have yeah yeah dogs and um and grass and uh you know the cement work and a little place that we made for a garden uh-huh uh yeah yeah um-hum so we do have a garden you know oh do you it's just a small one you know but we had a lots of tomatoes and uh zucchini oh uh it's amazing it's amazing what you can get out of a little uh-huh you know it's probably about twenty by i don't know twenty by six something like that and it's amazing what you can you know how many plants you can plant in there yeah yeah but it was nice a few cucumbers that's one part of gardening i haven't tried yet and i don't think this yard is a very um-hum um-hum  never did worked for a lot of computer companies in my life but not that not TI um okay uh subject is credit cards and how we use them credit cards yeah okay sounds like a good you ready to get started i guess so okay now what's been your experience with credit cards i stay away from them no uh i keep two i keep uh i got a Visa and it keeps a little balance on it not much and American Express is the one i use predominantly so i know i have to pay it every month yeah i know when i was younger twenty years ago or so i i got into quite a bit of hassle with them charging to the limit like to never caught them up well i i uh i belonged to American Express many years ago and uh they had a reputation or at least they touted that uh don't go don't leave home without it type attitude that it was good in Europe and everywhere and i went on traveled in Europe and i was just absolutely appalled at uh the they it was useless yeah and uh i think uh being overseas for about five weeks there was three occasions i got to use the card uh one little hotel out in the middle of nowhere in Scotland one little restaurant in Denmark and things like that yeah and uh later i uh well i get in a scrap with uh American Express because they made some mistakes in my account and it just took too many letters to get it straightened out i've had oh one time i had an erroneous charge show up on it from some credit card protection company or something and that took me a few months to get that reimbursed and uh find out what was going on there they had authorized they had paid somebody without my authorization yeah and i think the final letter was they were sorry that happened well i yeah well it was something i don't remember the exact details so long ago uh they tried to sell me some kind of a special card you know gold card or super card or diamond card and so to do that they had to change my account and so some bills came in under the old account after they transferred all the money out and rather than credit you know move the bills to the new account and pay them off as they should they sent me this statement showing this huge interest charge on uh boy on the account yeah i've never gotten into an interest and it took took me a while to get that straightened out never gotten into an interest charge with American Express i know they have it but i just you know if you get it paid within the next thirty days or something you don't have one so yeah well i tried writing letters to get it straightened out but it uh it took about eight months and i finally said cancel the account and yeah after about four months they quit sending me letters uh and now i only carry one really uh my wife insisted that i get another credit card and uh so i do have a Visa card yeah it's kind of hard to get by without one you know it's i rent a lot of videos you got to have one there and different places and so you just about got to have a major credit card my favorites though are department store credit cards uh you can just stop in and shop when you want and don't have to worry about your check book or having cash yeah and i found out with at least the two department stores we've done business with for years they treat you much nicer uh when you have a balance you pay it and there's never a problem with anything you want or anything uh and our give give the cards to my sons say here go get what you want uh-huh that sort of thing so those kind of particular credit cards i've always liked yeah well i have another credit card our company when you travel uh because of the tax regulations they don't like to make cash advances uh because there's uh they're concerned with the tax liability there so uh rather than make a uh cash advance they issue a credit card and you just charge as you go yeah and uh send your paper work in and by the time the credit card bill comes in presumably you have your check from the company the when i work that's the way we uh i had a corporate card with American Express with my company and everything was put on that they didn't care what was put on there just and i i usually i think one time in all those years i had a situation where my refund check you know my reimbursement checks hadn't gotten here in time to make you know a payment of five or six thousand i had every month too and i mean just one time  um what things are you looking for in a car what kind of car would you buy well right now i have a uh small Toyota Tercel for your next purchase uh-huh and i think next time i want something just a little bit bigger uh perhaps mid size i really don't don't like the the real big cars i'm thinking about maybe a Volvo uh-huh well it's funny because i currently also have a Toyota Tercel you do um when i first got married my my father gave me and my wife a a a used Toyota um Corolla uh-huh and we used that until we until it's about run into the ground and then we um bought a used um Toyota Tercel i was still a student at the time and um so um-hum um you bought what we could afford right and i think definitely um now we would also get a a larger car um-hum how did your uh Corolla hold up oh very well um for real it um did very well i mean um-hum do you remember how many miles you had on it in the at the end uh yeah it was about a hundred and fifty thousand and it may have gone further but um it was very reliable though for us though um-hum my my Tercel now has a hundred and forty six thousand miles on it um uh-huh and i really haven't had any trouble out of it except the alternator went out at about a hundred and twenty six thousand miles i think oh that's to be expected i would think right right hopefully hopefully it just doesn't happen at a a bad time i mean when you're far away from anything or something right and um it's really been great i have had no problems with it you know except little little minor things like you know belts and course you know uh-huh did you buy it new actually i didn't i bought it from um Hertz Rent A Car and it had like twenty six thousand miles on it when i bought it uh-huh i see but well sounds like it's been a good deal for you um-hum um another thing i may consider the main thing i look for in a car is reliability right and um i just go by what my dad says he's a mechanic and i remember growing up and and but he's always never wanted to spend a lot on a car because i grew up in a fairly large family six kids and we just didn't have a lot of money to spend on cars um-hum yeah so um i remember growing up and having like Ramblers and stuff like that and think they're the most unreliable cars that ever existed i mean ours broke down all the time luckily my dad was mechanic and he could fix them but i remember he said he said he would never buy um a foreign car but then in nineteen eighty he bought a used Toyota Corolla uh-huh and i mean didn't even spend very much money for it i don't think he spent more than five hundred dollars for it but he said it was the most reliable car he ever had purchased wow right and he has bought nothing but Toyota Corolla since that time uh wow and so um but i don't know my feeling is that American cars to keep up at all are becoming more reliable also so i may consider buying um an American made car yeah i'm trying to consider that uh that could do to the plight of General Motors and all of that my next my next purchase i'm really trying trying to consider but i don't know i i i don't want to have to spend a lot of money for car repairs that's true i have a cousin yeah one of my cousins is trying to tell convince me that um the American made cars are becoming reliable reliable but uh i'm not i'm not sure i just i know for example that both my Corolla and Tercel have been very good um and reliable that that i've i've used have you heard that uh or do you know anything about the foreign cars being easier to steal than the uh the American cars oh because there's a lot of of um car theft going going on in Dallas right now i don't know about in your area i'm in Iowa City Iowa very small town and i don't i don't know if there's even uh more than a one or two a month i mean um that's that that's not a big consideration here and i just moved from Utah where i that's where i was going to school before and um um-hum yeah also there um there's i've never had that concern um so i'm not really i'm not really sure  okay so what are your favorite shows um i like watching Colombo and um Matlock and oh really Quantum Leap yeah Quantum Leap uh-huh did you see it the other night um uh-huh that was a that was pretty good yeah that one was what is that when he with the psychic and everything uh-huh yeah okay yeah i like uh i like Northern Exposure and uh Home Improvement oh i well i haven't seen either of those you've never seen Northern Exposure huh-uh oh it's a great show um i also like to watch Star Trek but it's on so late here that i don't always get to see it really yeah we like it too have you seen the movie uh i haven't seen any of the movies because i just barely just like in the last year or so got interested in it and they're you know already out with number six by now but so i haven't seen any of the movies yet but i oh you haven't seen any of them no oh well they're good they're real good they're uh they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though uh-huh which ones are you watching the new ones yeah i've seen uh quite a few of the older ones i haven't seen really the new generation that much oh okay yeah is there one you prefer better the older one or the younger the newer one well they're they're a lot different but i like i like the older ones because at that time you know they were really futuristic you know oh yeah and the newer ones are i guess the newer ones are real futuristic too but i like i like both of them yeah i do too i have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot i mean he almost hates the new ones yeah because he he thinks the newer one is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something but really whatever no it's not really it's not really like a soap opera but oh i think yeah but it's but that's true i mean you you learn more about the the characters and stuff but that's the way all shows are now yeah sure well let's see um i like to watch Colombo because it's like a mystery thing yeah and that's sort of how Matlock is but Colombo is way tricky i mean he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them yeah uh did you see the one well the it seems they always show Colombo the same ones over and over though you know what i'm saying like that one where he goes to college um did or those is there a series on um yeah there's like one on well we see it Thursdays at seven and okay it was this last time it was about this um movie director did you happen did you see that one yeah i saw that one see that was a rerun really oh i guess i've never yeah i'm wondering if that's huh see i don't know if that's the the movie of the week or or what but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones and then and they keep showing them over and over oh i guess i've i haven't seen it before he was a movie director and he had that gal killed yeah okay yeah on the set or something that was pretty good though yeah it was but i yeah i like Colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things um-hum but um there's no never anything good on Saturdays though no kidding i don't think so well Star Trek's on at five but i'm never home so what is it that there's something i watch something i watch on Saturdays and i can't remember what it is now i used to watch Twin Peaks oh you never saw that i've heard of it a lot i've heard of a lot of people somehow or something they'll say so and so from Twin Peaks or something you know yeah yeah that was a definite soap opera oh but it was it was a different type of show uh-huh i didn't like the way it ended though oh did they end the whole series yeah oh yeah they didn't they only did it for i think two years oh but it's all over now oh another show i like to watch is MASH  okay Ron welcome to the net and uh what did you do about your last auto repair oh and might you say what kind of cars you have and so forth okay well Larry my last one unfortunately was a an expensive one because i had a brand new Lincoln Town Car and and um a couple of ladies ran a stop light the lights weren't working properly it wasn't their fault but we they didn't run it we both had green and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car so my goodness gracious that's that was a huge repair bill well that's still not enough for a total is it i know i hated that to get it's a very expensive automobile so it wasn't enough to total it but that's my that's been my most uh expensive repair probably in the last year with the except of just service work because i buy a new car every two years and oh and do you buy one every two years well i travel a lot so you know uh this last one i leased so i don't know and i leased it on a twenty four month program it's the first time i've ever done that but i'll probably go back to buying them because i don't care to lease them uh-huh did this car have one of these expanding balloons or just are there normal safety belts in it that you had no it has the expanding balloons did that help you uh it they didn't go off they didn't go off no i guess we weren't going that sort of upset me we weren't going fast enough according when i called the dealership about it and called Ford Motor about it but no sir didn't go off uh we were it was a bad rainy dark dreary day and well what and the street lights but you were hit in the side weren't you yes that may be the problem you you might you may need to be hit from something the leaning towards the forward to uh activate it yes took off my whole front fender and hood and everything i tell you just my goodness took it all off it was uh uh my my doors were okay front and back and um-hum but it did uh right eleven thousand dollars in damage it was a expensive then i get it back and two weeks after that i'm driving it in front of the local high school and some young man just wasn't paying any attention and runs in the back of me that's another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage so my goodness so i'm gonna get rid my twenty four months is up on this car i'm getting rid of this car i would think so that doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one my golly how about you Larry well i'm relatively fortunate about that uh here we somehow don't have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season uh students move into town who are from big cities and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks then they finally settle down and realize that they don't have to drive that way here and uh that takes the strain out off of everyone that uh is driving a vehicle i understand and i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to uh take care of us in the winter time i understand uh i have a sixty nine Cougar and a seventy seven Pontiac so forth and i have to uh and i drive a Honda most of the time and i have to make sure that uh salt and so forth are kept off of it and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it's rusted away sure well i understand that because i'm from West Virginia and we had the same thing up there continuously continuously salting the roads for snow uh-huh well i just i did i had this Cougar totally uh the body of it totally rebuilt uh to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders sure uh done and then it all repainted and then winter got here and so i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off so i haven't had a chance to drive it very much but anyhow uh uh now are you gonna buy this next car or you going rent it a lease again no i'm gonna i'm gonna buy it Larry i don't like the rental i think i'm getting ready to retire myself and i'm going to i'm going to be you know driving a car for longer so i usually drive a car are you for three years and and anyway and um-hum so but last couple cars i've only driven for two years so i'd leased this one for two years so i'll probably go back and buy one and uh this next car will probably be my retirement car well that's an awfully big one that uh that one that you had the Lincoln uh isn't it too large for normal town driving finding parking places and getting in and out the doors well no sir not really not really uh uh-huh no problem at all my wife and daughter we have uh two Toyotas in the family one Nissan and we have the Lincoln and uh the not really no problem there at all as finding as far as finding parking places it's it's convenient in that in that regard ah yeah well well that certainly would be a wonderful comfortable machine to take on long trips yes it is and i'm and i travel i'm like a traveling salesman don't travel a lot any more but uh when i do take it it is very comfortable to drive i'm i'm very much aware of that um-hum yes i'm sure it is because that's the way that i enjoy this Pontiac that i have it only has thirty eight thousand miles on it but it's very quiet and very smooth riding machine yes is that right well my wife's Toyota is soon to be four years old it only has doesn't even have thirty miles thirty thousand miles on it so gosh been much in such good shape that'll probably be an eight or ten year car um-hum do you do you feel that uh  i have trouble uh coming up with things that actually i've considered invasion of privacy and perhaps it's because i've become so accustomed to the fact that that's the way technology works life is yeah well you know there's something that um i really find kind of maybe it's not an invasion of privacy but it's kind of annoying what's that um you know phone calls uh automated oh gosh yes yes you know i mean i i find that really offencing or offensive i suppose that it's an invasion in that they know where you are and and yeah and they don't stop i mean they you know you call and it it could be any time of the day and and what happens is is they'll call especially especially those computer ones uh-huh uh-huh they'll call and and they don't you can't get them off the line you'll hang up and you pick it up a minute later and they'll still be on there oh seriously i've never had that experience yes i just had you know that just happened a couple day of i guess it's kind of fresh in my mind because this happened a couple of days ago i'd picked up the phone and it's you know they started talking giving me all this spiel and then you know you try to hang up because there's there's nobody to talk to there's only just um that seems unusual and you hang up and then you pick up to make a phone they're still on there you know that almost seems dangerous because what if you picked up the phone to call nine one one or something and you i know i know that is i wonder if that was a problem in their system that doesn't seem like it should work that way yeah but uh as far as privacy uh invasion of privacy i there really you know i guess i'm kind of like you i don't really find it haunting you there isn't a whole lot that i feel like it's a invasion of privacy of privacy um i used to be concerned that everyone no matter what the creditor always wanted to know your social security number but then i figured well they're oh i know they all have to link it back to some number that that only you have and so yeah everyone in the world that i've you know dealt with on a commercial basis probably has that number and that's just the way it is yeah well the i guess you know there's um they have access to all your records i i guess i don't think about that very often because it it has become the norm you know um um-hum um-hum if you wanna use credit you have to pay the price and that's yeah and you they find everything i mean they find out everything about you they want to know your you know where you live what you do what you know and some of the questions yeah and some of the um-hum that's probably why you have gotten those calls because they know that you're one of those people who um are in a i don't know income bracket or something but who has disposable income that's why they're after you uh-huh yes you know sometimes that does happen you know sometimes they they would you know somebody would call on the phone and and uh you know you think it's just uh regular type questions but really they are kind of prying into your to your life you know you um-hum they wanna know uh where you live how long you been living there do you own do you rent do you own do you rent you know what time of the days they're usually home what uh you know and sometimes you know you just kind of go through the routine of giving it out and then you think about it afterwards uh-huh why do they need all that you know yeah i generally don't you know when you buy a new product how the um warranty card always asks your level of income yes and it usually says optional so i i rarely fill it i i don't think i ever fill it out frankly but uh they they wanna know they would like to come back and uh-huh right oh yeah oh yeah see whether or not you're gonna buy another product yep interesting but um that's how marketing works today i think i guess it is i'm i'm in that area so it's uh are you well i'm yeah i'm in sales so i uh-huh you always kind of uh you know it i know that when we when i sell a product to a new customer that's always the first thing that i ask you know is about their credit and you know would they have to fill out a little credit application with with us and and sometimes i feel very uncomfortable in in doing that um-hum um-hum really huh um you know but i know that in order for our company to survive we can't you know uh oh yeah you don't wanna take risks don't wanna take the risks so um-hum um i i suppose some of those uh do you personally look at those credit uh references or is there someone else who does that you know that's that's the funniest thing is be rare i mean maybe one out of ten do we check on it yeah you know but it's kind of a routine type thing where you just do it and and you file it away and uh someone else in your company does that um-hum you know at random we'll we'll go ahead and check on it but um it's not um-hum oh really so there isn't someone who every time does it just not you no huh-uh hm so you know i just gather the information and and somebody else uh you know at their leisure time uh will check on those credit references but but most of them are checked on routinely just by someone else yeah most of them are yeah most of them are but they're not all you know they're not all done at the same time uh-huh uh-huh that makes sense and um you know i i wonder about credit uh  do you use credit cards convenience uh it i i use them for just uh everything mostly i confine my credit card to just one MasterCard do you but um i i carry it with me and clutch it tightly to my bosom at all times fortunately um uh i have a credit card well i have a two MasterCards one uh has a twenty dollar it's a gold MasterCard and it uh have to pay a twenty dollar annual fee but as long as i i pay off every month uh-huh there's no interest charge i see but and we never carry over we pay off every month what is the advantage then of a gold card because um you don't pay any interest if you have a regular MasterCard or Visa well one thing is whenever we rent a car we don't have to pay um any extra insurance so that we uh my husband's uh family lives in New Hampshire and uh it's about ninety miles from Hartford and ninety miles to Boston so uh as a general rule when he goes up there he rents a car so the times of the year that he rents a car more than pays the twenty dollar annual fee for having a gold card i see i see we used to get the American Express card and stuff like that and then we just kind of got back to plain old MasterCard and Visa uh because we never really had any um benefit that we thought was worth the the price of the special card so um-hum uh it may change you know if we do a lot of car rental which we don't do um-hum or other types of services i'm sure there're some things that come along with the gold cards that are appealing and and uh i've just wondered what they were they haven't been appealing to us so far no uh unless there's some no i there's no uh unless there's some advantage there's not any point there's there's no prestige factor involved yeah that you know i think that was my original appeal uh i was i was in my twenties and the American Express card really appeals to people on that basis of of you know you've arrived you've got this card uh-huh and uh you know it got to what fifty five dollars a year or something like that and my wife said well this is ridiculous why are we doing this and uh oh dear yeah so we stopped doing it and we refused to pay i don't know whether you know this but my wife discovered this we started to refuse to pay our banks uh an annual fee for the that for the Visa Visa and MasterCard and they said fine we'll give it to you anyway um-hum yeah uh-huh and we said you know yeah we're uh we're not interested in your card anymore and they said well wait a minute is is it the price and we said yeah so well we won't charge anymore you know and they used to charge what eighteen dollars a year or something like that twelve dollars something like that yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh so they're wonderful i mean i think credit cards are great we use it to get cash uh you know you can use it now in the Safeway out here in San Francisco and um it's wonderful in that respect and we're glad to have them we we can can you buy groceries with it yeah uh-huh yeah it's great you know and it eventually what we're gonna go to is nothing but these kinds of cards and it'll be MasterCard Visa and and American Express i don't think the Discover card's gonna make it in the long term um-hum um-hum um you know we don't need too many cards and and the American Express will probably survive but it'll have to become more like these other ones and become cheaper i think because the price will come down yeah i think so too i don't think it's worth fifty five bucks a year no it's not when you can use the the Visa or the MasterCard everywhere in the world and they're pitching that in all their commercials i notice yeah you really can and uh also um we travel abroad some and um it um you get MasterCard's accepted everywhere and and you get the yeah a a good rate you get a better rate than you do uh cashing in traveler's checks of course there are yeah well now now that's interesting i can see why because then they get some sort of advantage in terms of the conversion fee probably yeah and and even uh converting your traveler's checks at a bank they still charge you a fee right and uh well it it's gonna come that way and the reason it's nice is because basically what it does is put you electronically in touch with your financial resources anywhere in the world and that's where we're headed the technology supports that nicely and uh it makes more sense than than that because you have a card and if you have insurance which we have had on the card you uh can have you can lose it stolen um-hum and you don't get uh anything charged to you and that's great it's just insurance we're very responsible with our cards but nonetheless if we lost them yeah um-hum um-hum yeah it'd be great to know we didn't have to pay five hundred dollars or whatever yeah um on the cards we look for the low rate we have USAA cards uh you know USAA yeah we do too yeah but but USAA is Dallas based and uh that's a great thing for  yeah i pushed in okay so how do you use your credit cards oh we use them for paying our gas for paying uh just about anything because um we don't like to pay for our checks so we use it quite a bit um-hum but we we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we always we never get the the credit cards if there's a monthly or a yearly charge we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free so we never have to pay anything extra yeah that's me i won't use one that i have to pay an annual fee yeah we just don't think it's worth it you know and um i'm uh like you i i use it so well to buy my gas with my Shell my Shell credit card i use that and then like my Emporium card and uh uh-huh Weinstocks card i use that but i'm like you i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill why i don't just write a check i don't know see well you i don't do it either you know it's just really weird but i i don't carry a lot of cash with me because i'm always afraid that someone's going to steal my purse yeah yes exactly that's how i feel i mean it's a rare day when i even have seventy five cents in my purse yeah you know enough for a phone call and that's about all yeah but uh other than that that's the that's the way i use them i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got they can't they can't charge any more you know and i think that's terrible yeah because it's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something oh yeah yeah because if anything ever happens that you do need to you know you have excellent credit why it really does help yeah and i think it's more convenient too in a lot of cases like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our our Visa or our MasterCard or whatever and then um you know we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later yeah uh-huh uh-huh and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it we come out a little even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah well i think it's better to use credit cards too like i say because you there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket oh yeah they're going to hit you over the head yeah even if it's five bucks even i know it just uh you know it just seems like they're somebody's always watching so i just don't i don't carry money i'd just soon use my credit cards and just pay them off you know yeah and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it's twenty four hours you can report it in and i he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt right you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it and then yeah you know you can have your card back with yeah right pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever yeah right and you know some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything i know you know i don't know why they don't unless you have to spend a certain amount i don't know but i notice that some of them don't even look you know they just slide it in there and pass it back to you yeah exactly you know so i don't think that's right i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches you know yeah sure i mean it's just a precaution for everybody uh-huh uh-huh yeah so well let's see what else can i say about credit cards um um oh i also use like to use Discover when i can because uh you know they give you some money back every year yeah i don't i don't uh that that that's that Sears Discovery Card is that what that yeah yeah yeah now i don't have that one you know well we just started doing that and uh-huh you know what it comes in handy is for when you're buying things like um tickets for the train or um airplanes uh-huh because they'll give you some money back you know and it's only a little bit but i mean it's still something we got two fifty last year uh-huh uh-huh and so it's you know it helps out here and there so oh you mean uh for for you using your credit card you get like a rebate or something yeah they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing but when you you know when you add up everything you've you've charged up on the Discover card for a year uh-huh and they give you a half percent of that and that adds up to you know two fifty or something oh i see and so that's what and i know we're going to get back more this year because they you know we spent a little bit more uh-huh probably and they do it for how long you've been a member i think too um i see and they increase the percentage a little bit yeah well i'll  what experience have you had with family reunions well actually uh oh the last eight or ten years i have an aunt and i i should say have like done our family reunion and uh oh you know we send out letters to everybody and we rent a place in this uh savings and loan in a in a little town uh-huh and uh then everybody brings a covered dish and that sort of thing and uh it's real nice because my mother uh had seven brothers and sisters and if we didn't do this like the cousins would never see each other the aunts and uncles that's the type family reunion we've had there you know so uh you know if we found you know the years we don't do that nobody nobody sees each other because everybody lives in different places you know huh that's really good yeah my mom my mom's family is all my family is really scattered out so if we didn't have family reunions we simply would never see each other for example um my my parents live in Seattle Washington oh however all of my mom's and relatives and family are from Utah uh-huh and all of my dad's uh relatives and family are from Oregon so we we usually have family reunions once a year and we'll go to Utah and uh go to Oregon um my mom puts a big deal into the family reunion when they go to Utah um and um she sometimes plans them and and sometimes helps in planning them usually um Southern Utah is so hot that um we pick there's the they rent out this cabin that's up on a mountain i mean you have to go up into the hills to get some cooler temperatures and have a enjoyable time oh uh-huh and that's what we usually do and then have of course the food is one of the highlights also uh-huh yeah everybody fixes their specialty or whatever uh yeah yeah well it really in your case and mine too uh i guess in most everybody's as far as especially more distant relatives you know uh cousins aunts and uncles and so on you just wouldn't see them if you didn't do something like that well my immediate family like on my side uh has gotten large because there's four of us and now we've all had children and now we all have grandchildren so that makes just my immediate family like thirty people so we do a separate reunion and we have a lake house uh about seventy miles from here so we we've done it once we all get together down there and um that works out real well because there's a lot well lot of things everybody can do they can fish or they can you know swim or things like that yeah i know at the the family reunions on my dad's side that we go to in Oregon um we usually um have it at a park and so you know swimming is always part of one of the activities so uh-huh uh-huh well it really doesn't much matter where where or how you do it as long as you manage to do it every how often did like your families up there have them oh there's a there's a family reunion reunion um once a year um for for each for my father's side and for my mother's side i know and my wife also um so they try when they have family reunions they don't have them as regularly but when they do they try and make big deal out of it and usually have you know something like a talent show or yeah um each family um does something um yeah yeah we have taken like old home movies from you know twenty five thirty years ago and and shown them at the family reunion yeah my mom my grandma also has some we haven't particularly shown those at the reunions but my grandma has some home movies and we ever whenever we go to her house we like to see those those are you know nice for memories uh-huh we finally put ours on tape a few years ago there's places now that do that and uh it really is nice when you when because you can get on one tape you can get about thirty or forty old reels you know uh-huh on there and it and then you can skip around and find what you want and all that it really has uh worked out good uh-huh so uh so how did you get on the TI thing  what are you cooking for supper oh boy that's a good question i haven't figured that one out yet personally i'm thinking of making a goulash that sounds pretty good but i'm publishing a cookbook right now so or getting it ready to go to the publisher what type of food all types yeah different nationalities there's going to be a different section for each nationality it ranges anywhere from Midwestern cooking to Japanese there's some Scottish there's some Scottish in it some Scottish dishes that i know some Russian some for babies you know how to make baby food instead of buying it because it's so bloody expensive yeah yeah well i'm kind of a house husband and and i cook everyday that's about the only thing i'm a housewife huh i'm a housewife yeah everyday too and i've got two little boys today i made a banana cream pie my wife gets testy if i don't have some sort of dessert in the house yeah i made banana bread two days ago and it's gone everything i make disappears real quick so i guess people like it yeah sometimes i i make things and they don't work so i kind of throw them away before anybody sees them but i'm a i i don't know i live out of cookbooks other than stuff that i've cooked over and over and over yeah well see a lot of people do live by cookbooks not just house husbands but like bachelors and stuff they don't know how to cook anything you know unless they have a recipe to follow yeah that's why i'm publishing this cookbook because it's simple recipes it's nothing that's hard yeah it's just everything in it is really simple you are sometimes i like to get a hold of a very hard book uh and hard recipes especially some of the French dishes and where i've got to read it reread it and then keep it out while i'm cooking yeah and you know something new not something i'm going to fix every day or something just something for a special occasion right but i guess i know for like twenty years i my wife and i both been fixing a a chicken dish from the Philippines and it's really really strong with garlic and black pepper and we've always thought nobody would like it and uh we recently served it to some guests we had and and uh they all had to have the recipe oh really yeah and i didn't go easy on anything that must have made you good yeah it's it's delicious it's like when it when it's like birthday time and you say well what do you want to eat we always say Chicken Adobo and yeah it's just it's very pungent thing and and we just didn't think anybody would like it but they all went nuts about it and i've already heard that two of them have already fixed it at home so huh well my husband went to chef school before we got married and he can cook all kinds of fancy dishes and i can because i went to cooking school too but i maybe i favor the Midwestern kind of cooking because i grew up country so that's what i like to yeah where did you grow up in the Midwest well i grew up in Arizona okay on a ranch on a ranch and it was a horse ranch and we cooked country style you know i mean you don't peel your potatoes when you cook them in the country you just cut them up and there you go right i think a lot of the lot of the things that i cook and that my wife cooks they're they're from Midwest from Iowa from her background yeah because that's where we picked up the recipes and we have a lot of regional cookbooks from that area so it's especially when we're baking something boy we just go to those little city cookbooks and we know they've been tried and tested and and everything so yep well my mom published a cookbook when she was married to my dad which was about ten years ago but um and she published hers so now it's my turn i'm trying my luck uh we lived in New Mexico northern New Mexico for eight years and anywhere near Alamogordo uh no we lived up at Los Alamos oh so and then up in the mountains but we picked up a lot of uh Santa Fe type dishes and uh yeah that's usually what we'll fix if company's coming because they uh they expect it there's some really good food that comes out of there i'll tell you yeah we don't even like to go out to the Mexican restaurants around here there is none around here that's really Mexican they're all fake yeah well you know and when you taste the food you know it there's just a difference in this part of the world there's you know there's a lot and there's some from the interior of Mexico and country Mexican cooking and things like that so oh really you can get into some unusual things but i still find that you know especially even when we go back to Santa Fe that i'd rather have the food from there they just use more cheese and more beans and yeah well i live in San Diego and it's right near the border yeah but you'd be surprised how fake the restaurants are out here they knowing how close we are to the border i mean you only have to drive five minutes to get to the border you'd think that there'd be good Mexican cooking here  why don't you start because i'm sure you've seen more movies than i have i don't know um let's see have you seen John F Kennedy no have you no i wanted to go see that one i was hoping my roommate went and saw it and she liked it what about um Hand That Rocks the Cradle no and i like i heard some bad reviews on that it's supposed to be kind of scary well let's yeah yeah have you seen any lately what about videos no well i mean um let's see well actually i have seen one i'm trying to think of the name of it um it's got Bruce Willis in it and um is it a new one with him yeah but i can't think of who's in it but it was real good it wasn't Hudson Hawk was it no huh-uh that was horrible oh i haven't see that one um it's the guy that's from In Living Color oh even i mean Keenan Winey yeah i guess so Ivory is his last name i yeah well you you know who i'm talking about i'm trying to well i can't think of it but that was it was really i thought i liked it because it was funny and they had so many it was i mean it was really action packed and it was bloody but they had a lot of um uh-huh like one liners and stuff but i cannot think of the name i'm so bad with names of movies uh-huh well i had a little more time to think while they were trying to find somebody and you know i haven't seen i haven't seen um any current releases my husband and i just don't get out to the movies that much oh really do you have children um no but we we're lazy we like to rent and watch them and be able to rewind them and say what he say oh i hear you well Leslie there's um a ton we saw well we saw Flatliners i like that a lot gosh that's been out a long time yeah and um let's see Awakenings did you see that now what was that like oh it was great it was real good it was kind of and it's a true story or so they say yeah about these people that that uh like oh really near comatose i guess you'd say and they uh with medication they're able to wake them up after after like twenty thirty years and i mean it's not a real action packed movie but it was pretty neat um-hum i remember the name of it's called The Last Boy Scout it was with Bruce Willis and i can't think of the other name the guy's name but yeah it was good ooh and did you like that one you did okay and i'm trying to think well uh what about City Slickers since you watch um you know i've been wanting to i every time i go to the movie store to rent that it's all rented that's the same with same with me yeah i mean i've been at least three or four times just to get that movie and every time i go i guess i must be going at the wrong times okay well um let's see i did see Beauty and the Beast it's beautiful well i want to go see that one but i'll probably wait for it till it comes out on video because i don't think i can get any my date to take me yeah just go to a matinee there's so many kids there nobody will notice notice that you're not you know with a kid i said there's there's so many people you won't notice you're not they won't notice you're not with anybody well that's why i'm doing it well yeah that's true well um what about did you see Dances with Wolves yes i saw that two or three times and then what's the other one Kevin Costner was in hm yeah i saw that one too did you like that one Robin Hood okay yeah i've i've probably seen it about three times um-hum did you that was pretty long one yeah but i like Kevin Costner how many times did you see Dances with Wolves i only watched that once you did yeah and i cried uh i did too it was so sweet uh i could probably tell you more that i wanna see than i have seen what about um Fried Green Tomatoes yeah i wanna see that one too my husband kind of went hm yeah well so he wasn't real excited about going to see that one have may have to go with my mom well a friend of mine went to see is it what's the name of it Father of the Bride with Steve Martin and she said that was real cute um-hum oh really yeah i'll probably wait for that one to came up on video it has to be real good for me to spend the money what about the one with um Arnold Schwarzenegger whatever which one Terminator 2 oh i haven't seen that one either well that's good i cried at that one too you cried in Terminator 2 yeah at the at the end i won't tell you but i'll miss that okay let's see have uh did you say you'd seen Flatliners yeah okay what about let's see Edward Scissorhands yeah that i saw for the first time uh uh probably about two weeks ago i just loved that movie that was so sweet um-hum that's cute then there're some what are some other ones i wonder i haven't really seen that many new ones because oh no i haven't either my in in fact we're supposed to get out to movies tonight but i don't know what we're gonna go see now it's too late now yeah well we might be going to a late one yeah no well um trying to think what else i've seen that's even i guess if i see them it's because they come on HBO or whatever yeah see we've got HBO and you they have to be pretty old to get on there oh really well i think so i think they have a lot of the same ones run over and over again well see now Edward Scissorhands been on there like every week now yeah that's what i hate is they overdo it when you know when they get a major release i'm trying and then well what about the one with Tom Cruise in it that's an old one Days of Thunder yeah i haven't even bothered watching that one really yeah is it good it it it's okay probably have to be a Tom Cruise fan is it yeah well my dad is if you can believe that but i'm not a real Tom Cruise fan oh really nah he's okay but i don't think i don't see uh what i guess all the young girls see in him  all right uh yeah not as much as i used to be i i grew up in Pittsburgh and you say you a Steeler fan so did i no kidding did you yeah i left there i went to school out that way that about forty miles east of Pittsburgh and then uh i left in the mid sixties and right after i left well a few years later they started having some good teams yeah Chuck Knoll as a matter of fact uh did the coin flip in uh yesterday's Super Bowl yeah yeah he's looking good he's sixty i think and he just you know he looks real good he certainly had a an unfortunate uh end to a brilliant career yeah for considering yeah they just uh i don't know what happened they just weren't getting any draft picks and weren't i guess they just weren't picking the right guy weren't right people well that's what i think i think the the the sad thing about the Steelers is that they stuck with the crew a little too long and i think that's the the biggest problem for dynasties is that you just really have to cycle people um-hum right um-hum um yeah they uh he was loyal to a lot of those guys that helped uh helped him win those Super Bowls in the seventies and uh stuck with him too long and then i think the the draft uh picks did fall on hard times and they just never were able to get back to where they were yeah but uh uh we've lived here in Dallas for about nineteen years and i've never become a Cowboys fan in fact i don't i just don't like them at all but no yeah i how about Houston uh Oilers any more appealing to you oh i like them better than the Cowboys i don't i just uh other than the Steelers i don't have a real a real favorite uh like the Eagles i like the Redskins but uh usually like the teams that the Cowboys are playing for the most part you're a Forty Niner fan yeah well i had you know i was a Steeler fan and a Forty Niner fan um they've certainly built themselves a you know a great team as a matter of fact if they hadn't lost so many games early in the season i think they might have been a contender might have given Washington a game um-hum hum yeah yeah they had but uh they lost uh so many games early that they that their comeback made little difference at the end yeah they weren't the same without Montana well Montana made a difference but as the analysts analysts have said over and over again the game is won and lost at the line of scrimmage a smart quarterback makes a big difference and i really think for example yesterday Buffalo might very well have been in it until the end had Kelley been uh a smarter quarterback i i frankly am surprised that um-hum um Marv Levy would allow him to call all those plays oh was he calling the plays i didn't even yeah and i think that's just too tough in a on a uh uh you know a guy i mean you got to be real real savvy to do that and i don't see Kelley as being that savvy i don't i think that's one of the weaknesses in the Buffalo offense myself yeah yeah yeah yeah he had a because they certainly have a heck of a defense although it was picked apart a little bit i mean Washington just looked phenomenal um-hum right yeah well couple of those passes a couple of those receivers for Buffalo dropped some important uh passes too they it would have made might have made a little bit of a difference not much but uh and uh yeah yeah i don't i i just looked in the paper this this evening and trying to figure out when the last time the AFC won a game guess it was eighty four Raiders it it's it's nine years ago Raiders beat uh the Redskins i think as a matter of fact but boy it's yeah it's been been a while i was thinking maybe they uh ought to just AFC ought to just give it up and uh when uh it comes time for the Super Bowl the NFC champ plays an all star team of the AFC teams that might be a little more interesting because i'm getting a little tired of watching the blowouts in the uh well it is it is a little disappointing and there's some it it's very interesting to see you know what's what's behind this is it is it the uh i mean you would think theoretically that the draft picks would uh you know random and then free agency also makes a big difference right uh i don't understand it i mean they just uh they they Denver you know went a few times and they didn't do anything uh Cincinnati they didn't do anything now uh Buffalo yeah um-hum yeah well Buffalo twice well they did get close last year they could have won last Buffalo could have won last year against the Giants but uh just seems like there's a big gap in talent between the or maybe in coaching between the AFC and the NFC because it's like i said it's been nine years or eight years since they uh since AFCs won a game yeah but uh i guess they're gonna somebody was saying uh somebody i was watching the game with some people they were saying that instant replay may be on its way out i guess they have enough votes to uh or not enough votes to keep it going well you know i think that's sad in a way because i think if you look for example there were a couple of calls yesterday that were appallingly bad um-hum yeah i mean i just it's it's it's shameful and and i think that that once Pandora's out of the box you know yeah so i don't know i i i i think it can complicate things i recognize that but i sure think it's it's reversed some some calls that were bad calls although yesterday it didn't reverse one that was a very bad call what yeah well um yeah i just don't like it it it delays the game it delays uh i don't know it it just kind of interrupts interrupts the flow of things and uh i well there yeah there is that problem and and but uh i guess that that the real the real interesting thing is in the age of television you're going to get so much analysis of it that a that a game really for example yesterday when when Andre Reid um-hum  had to uh face up to the issue of putting parents in a retirement home well it's a topic that um my husband and i often discuss because um i don't have any grandparents and my mother is deceased so um we think about that often times with my father but there's plenty of other siblings to help out however on my husband's side um he has one sibling who is mentally retarded and um and then his parents and so we wonder you know how we're going to make ends meet once they're gone uh-huh um you know my mother-in-law constantly says things like well you know well i wish if one of us goes i wish we'd all go like in a car accident so that nobody would help nobody would have to worry about it but uh yeah um it's a scary issue i think well i've been very fortunate uh my father uh was very careful in laying plans for his uh latter years uh-huh and he was very concerned that uh mother be provided for so he went through a process over a period of about five years deciding where he wanted to be and he made arrangements to sell his house and farm and uh invested in a uh nursing home in Central Virginia um and uh moved in there and uh he made that decision on his own and uh he made a good choice he found one that had uh pleasant conditions for for him and mother living together and it had a uh nursing home attached to it um and everything sort of worked out very fortuitously because uh they moved into the uh to the retirement home in August and he died in September just just before his uh uh eightieth birthday wow wow wow and uh it was fortunate that uh uh he had made those provisions because at that point uh mother had uh Alzheimer's disease um and her mental faculties were going very rapidly and that's that's something that's very stressful to handle yes i know so uh we were very fortunate in having her in the right spot one um i think that's kind of the ideal situation is to have a combination retirement home nursing home and even you know if they need special care um my husband's grandmother is in a nursing home and i don't think they've termed what she has as Alzheimer's but it's you know she reverts a lot back to her childhood and she doesn't know who you are often times often times she does the one thing that she retains as far as her memory is concerned is um hymns uh-huh you know religious hymns she can sing them um and remember all the verses but when you talk to her she doesn't know who you are but the home that she is in uh it seems like a nice home but there are a lot of people there that are really bad badly off and they have them all combined together uh-huh and so her roommate um is um a person who entered herself into the home because she has really bad arthritis but mentally she is completely there so you know i don't know about that type of situation where you know you have a mixture but there is a home here in Dallas that um it's a Methodist home um for the elderly and uh they have that kind of situation it seems like what you were talking about with your parents retirement home and a nursing home uh-huh you know and even a hospital somewhat attached you know for those who need you know really special care and i think that would what be what i would desire if if i had to one of those um that's about yeah my uh i have uh an aunt who's in a uh home in Charlotte North Carolina and they they had planned on that for a number of years and actually uh made the payment on the condominium or the apartment uh oh fifteen years before they moved in oh really and uh so when my aunt finally got to the point her eyesight deteriorated and she could no longer drive and it was getting awkward to get to the store for groceries and things like that um and uh she moved in it was only about it's walking distance to where she lived so she retained all her old friends and uh they they look after her and they serve pretty good meals yeah um it's kind of amazing the disparity that exists between some  uh oh are you still there yes i'm still here oh i know what it was the answering machine must have run out of i i heard something click and i was like oh no it disconnected us well that no i think i think it's on i'm i'm so glad i got hold of you i want um something came up at work the other day people are wondering how to choose a college uh-huh and i was wondering how what did your parents do to help you choose a college well to be honest they didn't really do a lot i mean my dad sat me down i guess in junior high and said um that i guess they had called him from the school and you know when they start giving you all those standardized tests and everything and you know Dad said well you know you're a smart kid so you're going to college and you're going to graduate school so decide now what do you want to be here here are your choices you can be a doctor a lawyer an architect uh he gave me a list of choices all you know the different professions and i was kind of like i didn't even know you know i had no clues so i said dad well i can't stand the sight of blood so a doctor is out and uh i'm not i can't do math so a lot of stuff is out um i didn't think i'd be a very good architect because i like to draw but not that way so i said well i guess i'll be a lawyer because i think they help people boy was i stupid so Dad said okay fine you're going to be a lawyer so then when it got time to you know get close to you know you start getting college brochures and stuff my dad kind of said well uh what's the best law school in the country and all his friends told him Harvard and he goes okay well i think you should go there for undergraduate too so i was like okay fine so i like uh send them the uh you know do the what do you call it you know send for the things you fill out and filled out the forms and um they interview you they always have one of their alums interview you and at the time i applied you had to do it through Radcliff because oh used to Harvard was for the boys and Radcliff was for the girls oh yeah and even though they were combined you know even though they had to let women in Harvard you still had to apply through Radcliff so i did all this and uh a Radcliff alum here in Dallas did my interview and basically Harvard has a recognized and constitutionally upheld quota system and they told me that i was provisionally accepted but that if that they got a black person or Hispanic person or something that was qualified from this area that i would be bumped because i'm just a basic you know wasp type person so i'm not really oh you know they had this minority recruitment thing hum so and sure enough about two weeks before school started i found out that they had taken uh they uh found a black girl and uh took her instead so the only thing i could do was i had to go somewhere that you could pretty much register and start the next day so University of Texas was where my dad went to school and luckily it's kind of that way so i went down there and late registered and basically started classes the day after i registered so you got to choose a college twice yeah by myself good grief i mean my parents didn't really you know my dad was the first well my mom they were the first people in their families that had been to college which i know like people from the east coast colleges are all around you you know yeah and so everybody goes to college or it's more normal i think because a lot of my friends that are from the east coast you know everybody in their family's been to college but out here you know in fact my mother hasn't really been to college college they had a junior college yeah that was fairly close by and and so she that's all she ever did was go to junior college um just you know two year college and and got her degree but you know then my dad went back to school and finished school and went to professional school yeah but that was after my brother and i were already little kids so nobody in my family really knew how to advise me that was the same way in in my family of course my parents were divorced so it was just mother and my grandparents but one of the key things then was what could we afford to do oh yeah and i got a a co-op deal at one of the schools in New Mexico and i was there for a couple of years before i flunked out well where did you go to school in New Mexico New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and that choice i bet that was neat yeah it was but men out women numbered the women about twenty or thirty to one wow but uh it was just a very small school about three hundred students but the big the reason for choosing it was because of the financial aid that was available yeah and it that is really critical these days i think yeah yeah but then i my next choice in college was hey i move back with home with mom and i i went to the local university to get my grade point back up oh yeah so a decent school would let me in  good so what common hobbies do do you have Cathy and oh i do um cross stitch and some needle point cross-stitch and uh needle point uh-huh and needle needle point and i also crochet and you do crocheting yes my goodness i ought to have my wife here talking to you i think uh what kind what kind of hobbies do you have well i don't whether we can call it a hobby or not and uh many years ago music was a hobby to me oh yeah but as i have gotten older i found out that music has taken over about half of my time and uh now that i'm i retired about uh not quite a month ago that'll be uh i guess most of my efforts what kind of music do you do do you do you perform or do you well i i yes i play uh violin in um three different symphony orchestras local a local one here in State College and then one in Altoona which is oh forty five miles away and wow um-hum and another one at the Lockhaven University which is about forty five fifty miles away uh-huh and uh i formed what is called a State College Municipal Band oh about ten fifteen years ago i play trumpet in that and conduct occasionally once in a while oh uh-huh um-hum so i'm pretty busy in keeping that band going and trying to keep my violin playing up to uh an acceptable level of these other orchestras oh it sounds like you are busy that's almost an occupation now it does does take a lot of work and then when i have spare time i uh also am an amateur radio operator oh uh-huh but i don't for uh for ham radios um-hum i have so little opportunity i am hopefully the next year or so going to uh rebuild my station and uh get back on the air a little bit more consistently um-hum i do have the equipment but as the antennas blew down the last few years i just went off the air and that uh that was the end of that oh yeah i've always thought that was interesting i've never know anyone or or used a ham radio but i always thought that the concept was really interesting it is it's it's a very interesting thing to talk to people all over the world it's what it amounts to um-hum i didn't know how far of a of a distance i guess depending on what kind of aerial that you use depends upon the frequency and how good of an antenna you have and how conditions are about every eleven or twelve years conditions change yeah so that uh you're signals get into different parts of the world oh uh-huh man i have at one time or another talked almost not every country in the world but in all areas of the world wow i oh i have when i was really active i had well over a hundred different countries that i had talked to uh-huh regularly yeah um-hum fairly consistently yeah well tell me about this work that you do and uh do you display display these sell them or uh how do uh that's exciting oh uh well actually yeah i've i've done some original work not very much in cross stitch um-hum but i i did do one for my husband's mother and unfortunately she passed away the day i finished the day after i finished it you know that sounds exactly like things that Pat does but and uh she never saw it she never knew anything about it hum that is a shame it is and it's kind of spooky the the thing that i did i did the twenty third psalm the last verse um-hum and it was i presume you're familiar with that yeah and this is something that you would make into one square and hang on the wall is the way you do it uh-huh and uh yeah it's it's in uh it's one picture and it is hanging on the wall and i entered it in the State Fair of Texas under original art work and i won fourth place with it um-hum um-hum but i do pictures all around i've done some pictures oh i've done polar bears and sayings and i've done um uh sunsets and quite a few wedding and baby announcements where do you get the information to that enables you to do these different pictures uh are they already worked out so that you know most of them are already worked out i have worked up some but not many of them and the ones that i haven't worked out there's magazines everywhere um-hum yeah and there's uh craft books and there's several designers that once you've you've been with a particular craft like this you get to know the designers and you end up having some favorites in the designers hum well that is a very interesting thing it it is awfully nice to have something to do that that you enjoy so much that you can put you soul into it so to speak well well i do well and you can easily uh there's parts of me sometimes there's even a little bit of blood in some of my art work from needles yeah i can imagine from needles yeah yeah but i've got uh a little baby he's there he goes he's seventeen months and uh my cross stitch time has yeah i can hear him  that's that's a timely kind of a question isn't it well it was yes what do you think about the uh former Soviet Union i really don't think that i would consider them a threat any longer and i suppose that's primarily because their economy really won't allow them to uh expend a lot of resources on on war um if that were their primary concern yeah and it'll be a while before they're an economic threat for sure it seems that way sometimes you wonder if um an economic threat isn't gonna drive people to do things that would be more drastic than if uh they were a little bit more peaceful you know um-hum um-hum but i think it would probably not be a a threat to the United States if that was the case but probably to Europe other other areas of Europe there do you think that if their economy were in a better condition that they would be a threat uh that given their political changes they would still be a threat or well that's what it seemed like even before they uh dissolved the Union was that it was becoming less and less of a of a threat to the United States uh more and more of an attempted um-hum um-hum uh you know relating on more or less normal bases right are you involved in there there've been such drastic changes in their political orientation that it's hard to predict what it will look like in fifty years but certainly so far what we've seen is a turn around from where things were fifty years ago oh that's right that's for sure are you involved in any kind of uh political analysis or anything no no and yourself no not really we're involved in some of our company work in the Soviet Union in different places but not in really uh any area of uh endeavor that would be of any interest to you know militarily or anything like that uh-huh personal interests or business uh linguistics primarily uh-huh and so it's interesting to see uh how things are going there and and their the people that are there are facing the same kind of uh economic deprivation that uh you know the Russian citizens are but not it doesn't relate to much to the military uh situation yes yes yeah their problems are definitely at this point economic it it seems that the whole infrastructure is focused on you know organizational um skimming off the top you know especially the government but um it's gonna be awhile before the people adopt the philosophy that yes if you work harder you can also benefit personally and that yeah i read an interesting an article in a recent uh Wall Street Journal uh interview with a family there and you know we think of uh how great it is to go to a you know free market uh sort of thing and and they're saying facing uh something that most people are not even aware you know familiar with they wouldn't they don't know how to deal with it and uh how do you um-hum um-hum how do you compete when you you're whole you know life has been built on uh working for the state and everything you know things like that and and almost um the philosophy has been put in as little as you can because you know that the same results will will be there at the end so why spend the extra energy yeah right you face the same uh uh bureaucratic uh headaches whether you work or don't work so and so now they've you know so really it must be uh really traumatic time for the people as well as the uh uh-huh yeah lack of supplies or anything like that adjusting to the new way of thinking about things i wonder too if their thinking hasn't been so influenced over the years that the Western way is bad that um-hum it would it's hard for them to look at some of the Western market place strategies as being good because they've been yeah right taught to understand that's right yeah propagandized the other direction for so long well perhaps the uh if we give aid of some sort you know maybe it'll turn them around if it's done done correctly you know economically i think that they're one economy that i feel that that's worth the investment you know there are some um places in the world where i'm not sure that the money that the United States is putting in is really getting the kind of return that that's gonna benefit both parties but um it seems that there's such an effort to make it work there that what they really do need is is the loans and the uh strategic assistance from other countries i'll i'll be curious to see what happens in this elections because it doesn't seem as though that's forth coming right now um sure that you mean in in our country or in yeah i think well i was watching something the other day a news program that that indicated um the concern on Bush's part is that if he puts great interest in that area now he's gonna be accused of not spending enough time on the domestic issues you know certainly foreign issues are his strength so it's a catch twenty two sure yeah you can't that's right and well i hope you know just hope we don't wait too long and and uh you know  any pets yes i have one Chihuahua that's fourteen years old wow do you i have two cats oh uh-huh there's been a time when we had as many as like four pets when our children were growing up and everything you know but they died off one by one and that's it uh-huh yeah i bet you're attached to your Chihuahua yeah yeah cause they're just they are kind of like a baby you know they're yeah they are so little and cute you have to carry them around you know they can't do a lot yeah they are so little and cute right uh but well our cat died two years ago and she was eighteen years old well i am telling you this because you have cats wow yeah eighteen so she lived a long time was it an inside or outside cat well uh kind of both uh that's what mine are she had always been almost an entirely outdoor cat except we have a little door you know where she could come in uh-huh uh-huh but then as she got real old then she went out less and less and then not at all you know the last year or so right right right so uh huh yeah mine are two characters they're only what do your cats look like oh i have one that is a calico and she is not very friendly and i have one that is uh uh yellow and white long hair uh-huh and in the summer time we have to get him shaved and it's the funniest looking thing you have ever seen oh yeah to you to have him skin i mean his hair his fur shaved because he he mats up so bad oh oh and he doesn't lick his coat he doesn't and he gets great big old knots all over him and then when you go pick him up he looks so funny it looks like a cat going out for aerobics oh my goodness cause they don't shave you know their legs oh yeah i don't think i have ever seen a cat sheared like that no it's real strange they call it a lion cut they shave it all the way to the collar it's really funny he's real friendly he acts like a dog oh my i bet yeah do your cats get along well no they don't like each other at all they really don't that is really strange oh now we do a lot uh we our daughters are like in their late twenties and one of them has a Shelty uh-huh uh-huh and uh so any time she is traveling or she is working a lot or whatever all kinds of reasons her dog is here a lot you know uh-huh and uh its a very pretty dog you know looks like a little miniature collie right oh really uh-huh that looks just like Lassie except in miniature oh neat but uh it is a real pretty little dog but uh i don't know if all of them are that way or not its a real shy dog it really only likes like my daughter and us you know yeah and uh otherwise it'll go hide yeah well that is what my cats do when company comes they hide yeah well uh i uh now cats it is more usual i think to do that i don't think i have ever known a dog that would this i mean she is so shy yeah shy or what roommates she has had and all if the dog comes out and sees it is not my daughter she goes back under the bed she won't even come out that's why we have to keep her so much because she won't come out for anybody else oh my word that is shy wow does your dog and your daughter's dog get along yeah yeah they don't uh uh i mean they know each other and all that but they i mean they don't play or anything but my Chihuahua is older she doesn't care any thing about playing we have promised her that get in each other's way yeah she we are not going to get any more pets until she is gone she is going to be an only child yeah yeah because every when we got her she was like one of four pets yeah uh and now this is her time right right we had a well those are so cute i just adore them yeah well of course this one's do you carry it a lot with you in the car and stuff oh yeah trying to make a long story short we stopped at a service station several months ago and then when we got home i said well you get the dog i will get the baby i had the grandchild in the backseat uh-huh no dog the dog had hopped out at the service station to go to the bathroom and uh we didn't know it until we got home and i mean you talk about somebody being frantic and upset and and it took us three days of walking that little town and talking to everybody and handing out posters and pictures with pictures of the dog oh my word how'd you find it well somebody looked at the picture on the poster well not poster i made you know xerox copies looked at the picture and said i saw that dog Sunday and he directed me to who yeah  uh i mean i guess i get it most people i get it from uh the paper and the TV and okay i guess probably now the TV first the paper second and radio third yeah same here uh i hardly ever listen to news on the radio i don't even know if they have it anymore yeah i was just kind of think of the order you know but uh yeah what do you think about uh you know the second part of that question was are they doing a good job i'm beginning to think you know especially this week with all that stuff coming out about Clinton uh yeah yeah i think it's uh i don't know i mean it's getting a little bit ridiculous i mean this this i don't know if you saw it yesterday but uh where i was at had it on CNN and uh they had that press conference with that uh Jennifer Flowers uh Clinton's alleged uh mistress whatever and uh it just got to be so i mean it's ridiculous because you know one of the questions was uh do did uh Clinton use a condom and all that i mean it was uh uh the whole press corp was just laughing yeah i i got a feeling that you know cause from from what you know i got most of my information from the Larry King show and uh it was like nobody's verified her story at all and it just came from the tabloids and everybody jumped on to it right without and nobody's been able to verify that she's telling the truth all the only thing they know is that she lied about everything else yeah i think i mean he probably did it i mean that's my belief i just think that you know if he did it you know he should have said so on Sixty Minutes and cause i mean American public is pretty forgiving and most times yeah if you do something i mean what else can you say how can you would you go on national television and and uh tell the world that you'd had an affair and you know and your wife and her parents are listening and well now with that would be kind of rough to do yeah but i mean the fact is now that he's left himself the fact that he wouldn't deny it or confirm it was he's just left himself open to further digging from other reporters now you know there's all types of rumors now that yeah Miss uh America Miss Arkansas all the way down to Miss Teen Arkansas well allegedly had a thing with him i mean it's just going to keep dogging him i i think he's going to be out of the race in two weeks just because this is going to keep getting the fact that he won't confirm or deny i mean i mean he he's this has been going on for years though i mean he's always had rumors and stuff and yeah i thought we were kind of through with this a few years ago when Gary Hart uh got caught messing around and i thought we would kind of leave private lives out of this the politics but uh yeah and he no it's just i know it's just i think is just the fact that he uh he just flat out lied to the public that he didn't and it was totally proven wrong and then he challenged you know the press to you know prove it and they did and that's what killed him and Clinton on the other hand if he if he yeah yeah we're waiting i mean he took a big risk just even going on TV the other night with his wife but i think his wife came off better than he did but yeah in the end i think he's just going to his people now are you know the the fund the campaign you know they're going to wait and see what happens and you know when he keeps more stuff more stuff keeps coming out about him and then i think he'll be out uh you know he'll be out of the race eventually because the money is what uh the only thing that matters in the end and if he doesn't have any money there's not yeah well when i heard i guess it was yesterday i heard that she'd gotten in excess over a hundred thousand dollars to talk to the this tabloid thing oh yeah she she's a bimbo i mean you know i thought well golly gee she's got to be lying i'd say i slept with him for a hundred thousand bucks you know maybe but the yeah but i don't know i mean it's just the press is always going to be like that i think and you know i mean Americans most i think that most people in America know well i mean my people my age you know probably probably really don't care i mean what they i really don't you know care what they do as long as it doesn't yeah why has the press gone overboard in telling us things and but when the press says that you know some it's it's important it's got to be important because i mean they control i mean what's said and everything yeah i think it's i mean yeah i think it's totally gone overboard and i mean it's issues and everything and the timing of this can can be more worse for him but he he's clearly the front runner now he's about to get blown out of the water at this time well if if if if somehow he clears himself from this he is all of a sudden jumped out in front because everybody knows his name and and knows where he's from and knows what he looks like and i'm not sure everybody knows all the other people at all yeah uh i mean he he he had i mean he had the thing won but now i mean that are i i just don't think he'll be around i mean this this if you go by past history and you know he's he's dodging the subject now you know he says he clearly stated you know what he had to say on Sixty Minutes he didn't say anything all he said was that the American public knows that i'm mean you know okay what what do you mean uh Bill and you know i'm not going to confirm or deny anything i mean that's where you  um Tom what does camping mean to you well it usually just means sort of getting away from the normal uh time spent at uh day to day job in the office and trying to enjoy the outdoors for the most part um i haven't done as much as i use to but i i still like to go once and a while and go camping uh-huh um-hum well when i think about camping is uh well back from my boy scout days uh usually means hiking out in the mountains and and uh building your own camp fire bringing your own food in a pack um and right and things like that um things that i associate with camping usually the hikes and camping that we do we go to a lake and it might even involve some canoeing and and then we might i remember especially the fifty mile hikes where we'd hike from lake to lake you know one day we'd be at one lake and hike to another lake they might be about five or ten miles away the next day and the long ones right and things like that my son my son has recently joined boy scouts and i i've become fairly active with them and and uh he joined about four months ago and we've gone on about three uh camp outs since then uh two of which involved uh back packing and and hiking they're a pretty active troop and i've enjoyed it it's gotten me a chance to get back out and do a little bit more again uh-huh well i haven't done much recently that's just what comes to mind when i think of camping that is what i think of and was what i did when i was a boy scout um yeah yes uh we uh my family uh and i we lived in Colorado up until about three years ago for about fourteen years and and of course that was a great uh state for camping uh to get up in the mountains and it was easy to go some place on a weekend it's it's a little more difficult for me now living in Texas just because there is so much private land in Texas and there is not too much in the way of national forests and state lands that you can go hiking on here as opposed to states in the west i don't know how the Iowa area is for for that well i just picture myself and i was going to say i really don't know what's available here i know there's some lakes we could drive to but i don't know of any places where you know you can do hiking and stuff like that you can really yeah really get out and hike uh-huh i grew up in the Seattle area and the Cascade Mountains were just an hours drive away and that oh yeah uh-huh that's where we did a lot of our hiking and camping um and then i lived yeah while i was going to school at the University i was in Utah and there is also you know mountains there where you can yeah do hiking and plenty of hiking and camping yeah well camping camping i guess uh different people look at it in different ways and and do different activities whether it's canoeing or uh back packing or hiking some people just like to go car camping and get away and enjoy the part about building a camp fire and eating outside and and doing that sort of thing even if it is not back packing yeah camping can still be enjoyable yeah i know for from my mom um camping is um definitely bringing the Coleman stove and yes the two burner stove uh-huh even if we do build a campfire along side um the cooking is done on the Coleman stove just because it is more convenient right although even when my family and i went camping when we were growing up uh we went in the tents always you know yeah we we've evolved to the stage of uh pop up tent camper camping now now that my our kids have gotten a little bit uh uh involved with camping and my wife finally got tired of camping in tents and having to bail out the water during rain storms and so forth so she talked me into getting a pop up camper so our camping is sometimes a little more leisurely now than it use to be a little more oh in the camper oh that would that is what makes it a little more luxurious yes uh-huh yeah it's it's somewhere in between camping and going to uh a motel i guess well i guess the main point is to get to um enjoy the outdoors and you know especially if you go near a lake or mountains or you know beautiful scenery you know yeah uh-huh my my son's boy scout troop does an annual one week float on the Buffalo River in Arkansas and i am trying to make sure he gets his qualifications in by next spring because i would like to go on the trip with them because they camp out for seven or eight days while on the Buffalo River and they're floating floating for that many days and i am looking forward that would be uh roughing it more than i have in a long time that  have you ever been on a boat of course my dad is a big sailor so he likes to sail and he likes to do all that stuff but it's been a long time since he's had a boat oh that's yeah but we use to go to Lake Michigan and fix up you know work he had a boat that he was working on so we used to do that but i've never sailed so have you been up that is that where you were born is up there i was in from Chicago i grew up around there and then um oh moved down here about ten years ago now was it a sail boat that he had no it was called it was it was an old forty foot yacht that oh so you couldn't do much uh water skiing no i mean it well no and it it was never in the water it was on dry dock so it was uh always kind of just sitting there so oh good grief huh well so did you fish um he fishes i don't do you uh i like to i haven't done a whole lot of it in Texas we moved here from California and we use to do a lot more fishing there but huh so do you from from docks or from what uh well we had a friend that had a boat so we would go out there and there was lots of rivers and oceans all of that stuff we fished uh-huh huh my husband and i are you married nope divorced oh yep so now you're right in Plano um yeah we live sort of Fifteenth and Independence yeah well i'm up here on the north end of Alma oh yeah not too far so are you by Clarks sort of okay uh yeah yeah above Legacy from from there north of Alma yeah the clear uh in the boondocks yeah way out here i mean it's a subdivision but nobody knows it's even up here oh okay so you're far up there oh are you oh huh and you moved here how long ago about eight years oh yeah so you've been moved about the same time we did huh and you where did you move from we moved from North Dakota i was married at the time to a coal miner well he did you know strip mining kind of thing civil engineer but he um moved down here with that so we came down here yeah so that brought you down here yeah we were in North Dakota with mining too so oh yeah so that was real different i have four do you have children oh so do i do you where do they go to school then Shepherd Shepherd and Wilson i have uh middle school what grade what age uh twelve ten nine and three so a seventh grader uh-huh a seventh grader fifth grader fourth grader and third through yeah i have a seventh grader and a fifth grader also huh so then you have little one yeah and then i have two little ones one's a kindergartner and the other one's just three oh yeah so just well mine's almost four yeah little girl now is your seventh grader a boy or girl girl what's her name Megan Megan yep Megan Walls huh so yeah she's i know she's um in band and that kind of stuff yeah huh yeah so we're probably about the same age and same yeah exactly my daughter has a basketball game over there tomorrow no Thursday night yeah i know oh really oh to win against that team because our Megan's friend is on that team she tried out but she didn't make it so yeah who's her friend uh Mandy Philip uh Nichols Amanda Nichols she plays i don't even know what she you know a number we haven't gone to a game we were always gonna a game and we haven't so no don't know who she is yeah what does she play in band she plays the flute oh are you musical yes what do you play i sing that's what i started in college on yeah oh that's great so do you still sing yeah so then i do bells handbells we have handbells at church and so i do that and do that kind of stuff and but i just started i'm uh yeah i don't know now i'm out of that whole field pretty much except for on the sides kind of thing but yeah church related stuff huh yeah that's about it i mean that's all i have time for yeah that's right so that's what i do so have you been out on a boat at all in Texas never have you gone out to Lake Lewisville um no no you ought to go out there it's fun just for family just to stay along the sides we go we've gone to Lake Lavon yeah and um what's else is east Hubbard Lake Ray Hubbard i guess so we've done those and uh camped there and that kind of stuff and we've camped up on um yeah uh-huh Texoma oh i bet that was fun yeah but i don't know that i've boated there i don't have any friends with boats yeah no neither do i no well i'm gonna have to do a better grouping get better friends why don't we sign up for boating huh just so they'd call us i know because i thought well gosh well i was figuring you know um as i was listening to this is sailing and and i thought it's probably a man on the other end i know i've gotten those basketball ones tell me about your favorite basketball team well my daughter plays for Hendrick does that count yeah they're seventh grade girls yeah they couldn't relate to that at all it's called Walnut Creek no well where in California are you from it's kind of by Oakland oh i know where San Francisco sort of area yeah because we have apartments there i do i do recruit nurses oh for a company called Flying Nurses and so we have apartments in Walnut Creek is that right uh i don't why that rang a bell i know oh that's  obviously there have been a lot of changes in the roles of women over the past couple generations do you do you wanna speak first about your opinions about what those changes have been okay um i think although there have been some i'm still of the opinion that we're second rate citizens in most areas yeah uh i believe probably World War II is when you know the thing started that caused women to be more liberated because the men were at war and they needed women in the factories and things have never been the same um-hum um-hum as far as the as far as the job market women started working outside the home then but it's taken a long time and i think we've got a long way to go uh well i agree with you there i feel that there's there's is a turning point ahead still ahead of us we haven't gotten there yet yeah i agree with that excuse me but i do think that there is a greater awareness of the the benefits that the the feminine side of people offers you know as well as men you know when you um-hum right when you see some of what's gone on in the self development areas um you know men trying to find their feminine side is is probably something that men uh right half a generation ago wouldn't have even considered as feasible no no and then i think it's a good turn i do see uh one of the reasons i also believe there's a lot to be ahead as i return to college and uh um-hum i see girls of twenty or so they think there is no problem they don't realize the struggle's just at the last few years um-hum for them especially to go into professions that they could've just been laughed at and it can't be done anymore at least legally it can't be done yes that's true that is fairly recent i think yes and i think just like today i mean it may be people that don't want you in a certain profession they can't state it where i don't think the change has come like from the men's side is they can still feel it uh-huh you know i think i feel i definitely feel that that's true in the political arena it's gonna be a lot longer before women are in positions of authority authority on a on a majority basis you know there's always gonna be a a few but yes yes you know whereas in education and in health care women dominate because those are seen as supportive roles right right i think it's interesting to just look at the history of women in history in in several cultures to to determine why in Western culture they take the role that they do because it's it's a matriarchial society in a lot of different parts of the world that that puts women in a much stronger position and yet in the west it's um-hum just coming around to the point that we can recognize that the power that that a woman offers to the society you know in terms of nurturing as well as yeah right yeah i wasn't aware of that either until uh just a year ago when i took a sociology course that even existed that's how indoctrinated i was um-hum um-hum but then i'm forty six i grew up with the generation of the guys my brothers went to college and i'm now struggling to no and it that's exciting wasn't important you know you go be a secretary or be a beautician uh-huh uh-huh that was my choice and uh but yeah i didn't even realize there were societies like you say where women were were important uh still a lot of that influence yes yes and there's so much that's um inculturated we don't realize in the home how we're how we're influenced i think that even though my parents might've said you know i'm i'm in an area uh health care where there are a lot of women obviously but my orientation was never toward being a physician it was toward being a health care provider in another area and right even though i heard from my my father it certainly go you know pursue as far as you can you can be a physician there was this under lying tone in our home because my mom did not work outside the home that it was also okay to not do that and so right it's been a challenge to to cope with both of my orientations i i have a very nurturing side that would in some ways like not to work outside the home right well i find myself looking towards what i'm doing and i'm leaning towards education and that's still another area of women but that's what i wanna do you know have made i have made that decision that that's what i want to do even if it is the traditional thing it's still what i wanna do and i know it's like um-hum hum yes i think that over time we will recognize what our given rights our our given uh gifts are rather that that are different from men and and it's okay that that there are some differences but that there are also a lot more areas that can overlap that that at this point don't i think girls are told that they're probably not gonna be as good at math as as boys are and and they they right yes i'm suffering suffering through that too yeah they may be influenced by that in their school work i was very seriously i don't know if i was by my by the influence or whether i just am not very oriented in math as i am to other like verbal well i'm not because i have been tested by the office  okay Lee tell me about your ideas on this uh the US government supporting health insurance and so forth well i think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately uh the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote has uh provided some very good health care and uh much i think inadequate health care uh and in some cases the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces and i think um it's inevitable it is just a matter of uh time and mistakes and they're both inevitable well what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing uh a good job well it's gonna make it tough for them and it's it's gonna be a difficult transition i don't know uh how it's gonna uh play out in terms of the particulars but i don't think society society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long our uh physical mental and spiritual health uh it's really uh very costly and uh as a society we are paying a staggering price for this my yes well this is what's bothering me Lee another question do you think that there should be some control uh innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously ridiculously over priced things we realize that for the individual person some things are very important uh matter of fact in some respects their life might depend on it right but by the same token some of these charges they make for well well minor endeavors shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line there should be some control of that um-hum yeah yeah there are abuses of they're abusive of privilege yes and that's what's giving the local um insurance companies hard times that's the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals and you get something done and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it right well this i think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten or twenty or thirty years will address because i know this is addressed by uh in Canada i i have a good friend who is uh a physician practicing in Canada and they made the transition uh and i think that the uh for example duplication of magnetic resonance imagers uh yes we've had several of them my wife and i both have had that recent i've i had one myself and uh they're wonderful technologies but cities have uh three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need so i think that what the marketplace doesn't do because of the way the system has worked and it doesn't allocate resources optimally because there is a tendency uh at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills what's begun to change all of that the people paying the bills uh employers ultimately have begun to squawk because they've seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years yes so i think the evolution will be interesting uh Hawaii has a system that is apparently working and uh it'll be interesting to see how how uh much more attention we pay to that i do think though that it's inevitable primarily because of the pain uh that people are feeling uh under the circumstances and i believe that it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care whether it's subsidized by the government and and operated by private insurers uh i don't know i like that idea i tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances with the profit incentive work very very well uh i we would be a lot better off if we if we contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste see that that bothers me about the government see uh my that's that's that's the problem with government uh uh administration of these programs and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with government is gonna have to change in this regard do you think that these that these insurance things should be covered on a state basis or US government basis you know that's really a tough one for me to answer i don't uh uh i would like to see the greatest improvement in management my my field my field is the cognitive sciences and i recognize that a lot of these things that are done are done um as a function of the operating systems in place and those operating systems have to change and and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems and so a state or federal application uh could work uh it all depends upon the way we structure the environment we may have to do  well what do you think about recycling well it's uh certainly would would help things out uh i don't see a terribly lot of it going on uh here i don't see a lot of it here either i was actually quite surprised i went to uh San Francisco recently uh to Berkeley and and uh uh-huh they actually have mandatory recycling well no theirs theirs is not mandatory i'm sorry uh but you know it was just incredible to see everybody with you know with with ten bags of things and they they have a community recycling center uh where rather than than having monetary incentives for the the people that actually bring stuff into recycling they're just doing it to help out the city and then the city can use that money you know any money that they can get from that goods that are recycled well i think if they had some place up up in your area like i know they don't here yeah no i would i would be glad to but you know we have no place convenient at all i mean i am not really concerned about making money off it um yeah you know i mean that that the amount of money that would come out of it is not really enough to make it worthwhile that's true it's just the recycling per se uh we do very little uh recycle newspapers but other than that kind of a shame yeah we we do our cans and stuff but um um you know i don't know if there is someplace close by where you could take everything i know in our neighborhood every so often every few months they'll put in our subdivision they'll put out um like dump trucks so you can get rid of your trash and garbage in your yard and they'll haul it off for you and it is all free if they did something like that and they they'll get a chipper you know like in the spring and in the fall um-hum um-hum um-hum right if they did the same thing for recycling i think that would go over real well yeah i i i think you know i think that if they would have sort of neighborhood or or semi neighborhood recycling centers that is what i saw in Berkeley was it was real interesting it just had uh bunches of bins and and uh in different in each for different thing uh uh you know they even had a specific specific of course being in wine country they they even had wine bottle recycling so you take the wine bottles and the the the wineries would actually buy you know take those bottles back directly uh-huh wow and recycle them yeah not and not to have to melt them down they just reuse them uh but they had things for for different types of paper and they had things for the aluminum and then for plastics and were they all over the community apparently yeah there there you know there is only a matter of maybe ten fifteen blocks away from where these friend of my lived and and they just save everything up and took a trip over there and they they didn't get anything for it but but um uh-huh right you know the thing is that a center like that i am sure it would be self supporting if uh you know just off the proceeds from from recycled things well it couldn't like glass companies buy the glass back from uh the city or something like that yeah that's what i am saying you know they could pay for it you know if they have to have someone there occasionally to kind of keep an eye on things or do stuff you know that that salary could easily be paid out of the money that comes from uh selling glass or or aluminum or whatever right and uh you know they even had uh they even had a little little shelf area for recycled books where people brought books they didn't want put them on the shelf and people just come and take anything you wanted off the shelf and yeah well i'll be it was uh quite quite an operation well that's pretty neat maybe it'll catch on all over but i haven't really seen it around here hardly at all yeah no no i um i have seen where one um i think trash company will put out you put out a bin but it it was never explained what you put in it um-hum you know and do they really you know i haven't seen a special kind of a truck oh in this area now i've seen them uh around Austin uh some they're they're like three division trucks you know it has three compartments yeah oh oh i haven't seen those now i i i think i have seen them actually going with like a sack on the side where they are picking up aluminum cans people put them out separately and they'll they'll toss those in a in a bag on the side of the truck or something but huh hm yeah i i i think that there is a little bit of you know of of you know i think that they the emphasis on making money from recycling yeah is is a is a little bit wrong certainly there is money and value to somebody but i think that the average consumer probably doesn't want to spend the time and it is not enough money to make it really interesting anyway and so right um you know i think they they ought to make more of an emphasis on on convenience as opposed to to uh you know to trying to give people money for it yeah i know i know if they did something like that at work you know if they separated paper where i work they don't even separate the paper oh now that we do we where i work we we recycle the cans and bottles and and paper but there's a lot of computer paper generated so it's you know generally clean white paper yeah yeah and uh now see they don't even do it where i work for a private laboratory and you know that uh ordinary office paper which they go through a lot of it and they they shred all of it um-hum oh you know and i would think you know and i see them carry them out  so okay so what is the subject now it's on the the time that we spend with our children okay well let me tell you about our our situation um we have two girls uh one is twelve one is uh okay is eleven and i've got uh two sons that are um um-hum six and three um-hum and uh between the four uh my two girls play a lot of soccer and we travel a lot with them and they're either practicing or playing and and it is really tough to fit everything in um-hum and uh you know i'm not real sure what your situation is if you you have any kids that are still at home but uh we just uh well we have the one that uh has left uh-huh but he was here a year ago and uh he was involved in wrestling wrestling and along with my three older sons we had six children and our oldest son our second son is uh oh is that right uh-huh he's a doctor and he was uh All State in wrestling and then uh my last son that just left home is All State in wrestling so we had two in our family but we had a lot of participation with them and i know what you're talking about where you it's difficult to find time but i oh i i feel it's very important that you support the kids as much as you can you and uh uh the spouse because uh when uh well both sons uh when they were wrestling uh they would kind of look up you bet to see if we were in the audience and the that's the last they pay any attention to us until after the game is over right and the wrestling match it sure makes a big difference doesn't it and uh we really enjoyed it uh to be involved with our our uh children and i think it's very important that's something that yeah the parents today and and and there is so much involvement that it gets pretty difficult but i think with with church and everything else that you're doing yeah but uh that's where a family relationship is really built and uh it's uh then they have it sure is we have uh in fact we this this past um Christmas we went out to California we uh both my girls were involved in in tournaments out there so went out there we spent Christmas with uh my wife's family out there in in California and then um um-hum uh-huh we drove out to or down to Southern California and had the tournament we went to Disneyland as a family and and just kind of you know spent time together that way well super well those are things that they'll they'll never forget and uh they know they're loved when when that takes place yeah and that you're supporting them there are so many families that i know about today that they just don't take uh time to do anything with their children you bet my wife just said to tell you that your grandson is beautiful oh good good well we're gonna try to get down to uh hopefully for his uh uh the oldest one's uh baptism and then the grandson's uh our youngest to get his uh to the blessing but i don't know whether we can make it or not we're gonna give it a shot but that's coming up to be blessed yeah i know that means a you'd mean a lot to uh to Brian he's a he's a heck of a nice guy boy i really enjoy uh being friends with him he's i appreciate that he was a super son and when he was wrestling uh we had two sons wrestling and we one week we went to twelve wrestling matches in one week is that right we had one the oldest his older brother was in college and he was in high school and we could uh get to all of those but when did he find time to learn how to do brakes he just helped me do my brakes oh he he's very talented in all kinds of things uh he's not like his dad he can do about anything and uh we really miss him being in in Texas yeah he is yes uh-huh so anyway well that's great yeah um my work uh uh fortunately my work doesn't take me away from from this area so i have uh i have some time i own my own business out here so i have some time just just spent with them you know whenever the time uh whenever they need me but um um-hum well that's super i i know that there's quite a few people in our family that uh or in our you know in our area that um that work outside and and they have a even tougher time trying to uh schedule time with their families um-hum yep well be sure and tell Brian hello and it's been a pleasure talking to you sounds like our time's up and uh give him the the best from him his dad okay i'm i'm not sure if our time's up or my phone just went out of out of whack i think that was just my phone oh oh i see okay i've i've this the first call so i don't know what happens when the time's up well they'll come back on and tell us when the time is up yeah it they should be another couple of minutes so oh i see okay fine and course church involvement i think is very important too uh that with parents uh supporting their children in in taking them to Church and going with them uh-huh oh yeah and that's that's another activity that uh time is spent and well i think that's it that's probably more important than anything else and  how do you get most of your news well that's a a good question um i read the newspaper obviously and and watch TV and uh what are your favorites on TV for for news programs uh we have one here at at at six o'clock in the evening to seven where we have local news followed by uh and i i i can't name the CBS i guess it is um-hum who is who is the gentleman that uh MC's that program uh that's terrible i know i should know these but is Dan Rather C B S yeah i think in fact i think it's Dan Rather yeah i i i have uh been just retired recently so i have had very little time really to watch TV and uh to get the news so all of my time that was available was between about six and seven uh obviously i scan the newspaper uh-huh um-hum and um i think are you one of those people that tends to like to go through the paper first thing in the morning over coffee or breakfast or something or do you tend to like to read at the end of the day no i get mine at the end of the day yes that's the way i am i at least i used to and now i'm beginning to read it about noon since i just retired i i retired from Penn State and i just uh now i have some morning time available oh that's nice and it used to be that we got our newspapers in the evening which i liked because that's when i could read it and i felt like it was fresh um-hum right and for the last two or three years our newspapers have been coming early in the morning and it's been six or seven o'clock at night before i got to read it yeah and i had already heard all kinds of conflicting things during the day before i read a newspaper oh really sometimes it feels as though what i'm reading in the newspaper is the old news it's as if i heard it just the day before on the television and i wonder where they get a lot of their stories but i think that yes the one that i'm i feel like i get the most information from is is uh McNeil Lehrer and sometimes it's on in the afternoon if i'm if i'm home but i work most the time so um uh uh-huh the program in San Francisco is on from six to seven which is ideal because well that's my normal time six to seven for here yes you're preparing dinner but you still have an opportunity to to look at it occasionally we have a little two year old so there's not a lot of time to for me i feel to spend as much time with the um-hum updates as i'd like to i think i probably get more of it from Lee because he works out of our home and um can give me information about what might've happened that day if he watched the afternoon McNeill Lehrer how do you feel about the authenticity of these various uh methods of presenting of representing the news it it seems to me that McNeil Lehrer spends more time with each issue therefore i can count on it being more accurate uh because they've really spent more development of the story as well as research and and i get a better picture of what it is that i'm hearing about i i wonder about the authenticity of the others um i i have a feeling they get a lot from UPI and AP and maybe they count on what they get from those reporters and just give little spots to it and yes i always wonder about the accuracy of their source of information that's what bothers me particularly you know when we're had this business of the of the war over there in Europe i mean i always wondered about um-hum um-hum it that they based what they said on whoever told them well whoever told them might not necessarily have the accurate news and know of the overall know the overall right and certainly in that situation there was an effort to exclude the press from some activities because they didn't want to have a lot of political fall out i think but there was probably story yeah some repetition of of stories that didn't have complete um confirmation i wondered that about the whole Clinton thing recently um you know something coming out in the tabloids and being picked up by a major media uh one of the accusations obviously is that they didn't go down there and research it and and get enough information i don't have a preference or an opinion really on that story one way or the other but it's uh um-hum it's clear that there's a lot of controversy about it well then the the only thing that you can be sure of the uh has gotten it straight from the horse so to speak is did you hear uh President Bush's speech the other night yes well at least we know what he said this is true and we we don't have to to uh read in the newspaper what they think he said or what the Democrats think he said we know what we heard him say uh-huh uh-huh but it is always interesting to hear the follow ups you know on any kind of major presentation you always get the analysis yes that's when you find out of all the disturbances that are in the background that know one else knows about that's the problem when you're in a politics uh-huh there's always somebody working behind your back and who just doesn't want you to get your way simply because you're on the other team well that's ridiculous really well they all have their perceptions too you know they may have heard the exact same thing and that's just their yeah yep  so fishing huh yeah you do much fishing out there i use to i don't now did well you know we moved from California we moved from northern California to come out here and uh i oh really we did quite a quite a bit of fishing out there but uh out here in uh in Texas it's all man made lake yeah that is what it is in Arizona Arizona is where i am from oh is that right i have only been in California for about two years oh and in Arizona that is all they have too is man made lakes because of the desert yeah well that's kind of the thing here in in Dallas and it's it's a whole different kind of fishing than yeah than uh i uh am use to in California i'm use to deep sea fishing out there and fishing off the pier and stuff and uh out here in Dallas you have to use lures and yeah uh all kinds of different things i haven't had a chance to go out fishing much here but i use to do a lot of fishing out in California well i lived in Washington State for a while do you know do you know where Seattle is well it's about thirty miles outside of Seattle there is a place called Westport uh-huh oh yeah uh-huh and it use to be the salmon capitol of the world and when i lived wow they did a lot of salmon fishing up there then yeah when i lived there i use to go deep sea fishing with my dad all the time and it was really it was really neat but when i went back to Arizona because that is where i am from well when i went back there to be with my mom uh-huh uh-huh it was like a totally different kind of fishing i was like ah what do i do yeah it is and uh the bait that they use is uh is totally different in California than it is here in Texas and uh yeah um you know we uh use to use live bait in in California and they do use some live bait here but not a not uh whole lot not like you know you use to use in California and uh yeah i haven't i haven't been fishing since i've been to California because i have been having my kids and yeah how many kids do you have two two two little boys two little boys one's three and one's one wow you got two little ones then huh well i have got four i have got a twelve year old an eleven and uh yeah six and a three sounds like fun so i'm stopping at two you are oh yes i only want to have to teach two of them how to fish i don't want to have to teach four that's true oh that's we use to have a lot of fun when i was actually my my two boys were born here in Texas but uh my two girls i use to take them with me when when uh we would go fishing you know and my wife and i use to like fishing off the pier and stuff and we'd catch uh shoot one time she she caught a couple of sharks off the pier oh and uh you know we caught uh what do you call uh those flat things and we you know we'd get crab and stuff off the pier and and uh yeah that's that's stuff that we that we miss being here in Texas we don't have much of a chance to get out to the coast and and uh yeah it's amazing how few women actually fish yeah my wife loved to fish she didn't like to uh she doesn't like to put the bait on but you know that was my job i just put the bait on and she'd catch the fish in fact we use to go out and and this was not really that funny at the time but yeah it's funny now you know i'd we would get two poles uh-huh and i would you know i hook hers up she would be out there and i haven't uh i i wouldn't even be able to tie my hook on she'd catch a fish and she would yell at me to come and take the fish off so i'd take it off and walk back and put my hook on she'd call again to get the fish off her hook i mean it went like that for a whole hour yeah my husband gets kind of upset because him and i have an agreement i i'll bait my own hook and i'll catch the fish but he's the one cleaning them because i won't clean them that's the only thing i will not do uh-huh uh-huh and uh he gets really disgusted because he he says i i talk to the fish i don't talk to the fish they just jump on my hook you'd talk to the fish that's what he says because i'm really lucky at catching them uh-huh no matter what kind of fishing we are doing i i seem to have really good luck and it's like i don't talk to um and they just jump on my hook i don't know yeah well uh that's my wife yeah that's my wife uh every time we go fishing she's the one that catches them and i'm the one that takes them off and baits the hook and then it goes all over again so yeah my mom got remarried and she got remarried to uh a commercial fisherman oh is that right and he was like women don't know how to fish and da da da da so him and i went out fishing one day uh-huh and i and he goes do you need me to bait your hook and i said no i can handle it uh-huh and so i baited my hook and by the time we left i had six and he had none he goes oh my heck he goes he goes tell you what why don't you do my job for a while i said no thanks cause i don't clean them oh that's funny so he cleaned them all and i gave him and my mom four of them and i just took two of them uh-huh but he was just so disgusted because he had never seen anybody that had that good of luck now do you like eating uh eating fish oh yeah i love fish is that right i i grew up in Arizona so i guess that's why because uh-huh  okay so what now what are your opinions on recycling well i definitely think we need to start recycling i think it has got to be an individual responsibility until i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it's gonna be too late yeah you know i've heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand yeah i've heard that too and that's not too far away but i don't know how it is there it is very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my paper i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take um-hum plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them and there's some fire stations i can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile well see i had started saving newspapers and i have save a ton of them and uh that's i can't remember where i went to take them but they wouldn't they wouldn't take them um-hum yeah it's very hard to find a spot and then i don't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that cannot glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to oh i know there's no really recycling facilities no we have a pilot program in Arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they're having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out i think that's a good idea and i think that's what it is gonna have to come to where we're just forced to besides well like a law or whatever and that's how it is in New York or isn't it yeah i think so it's just because they have to you know um-hum you get ticketed if you don't do it right right uh-huh and i think it's going to come to that because some people will just not go to the it's it's trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it but yeah plus you have to have a place to store all of it and see i live in an apartment yeah yeah it's very difficult like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers and so i don't know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in Iowa the state i'm from um-hum uh i believe it's gone up to a dollar now everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store and you get it back yeah uh so that way that kind of forces you to recycle you're forced to and uh you also don't see the litter there people just yeah that's true it makes it worthwhile to take it back and i've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian i don't know if you've tried it yeah i've seen them and they have on the back it's five cents okay it's still five cents and it even shows the states that um-hum that take them back yeah well what some of them are five some are ten cents i am looking at it right now is Texas one of them Texas is not one of them see so i have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass yeah so no i don't think that there's enough being done now i work at JC Penney at their corporate headquarters and we have a paper recycling uh-huh program that's um company wide and i do the recycling for that okay do they save like the paper they they use at the office paper good because there is a lot of waste there isn't there yeah yeah i know there's a lot of computer paper though that you can't use right right but um we use to have uh i mean i i don't even remember how much money that they've um mean i mean the money that they've made from the recycling program they've donated it to charities but i mean they've made a substantial amount of money from it right yeah something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage like i've decided Downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton yeah you add water i'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am gonna stick with Downy because they were first you know i want them to have my business yeah and i think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic that well now you see some of this stuff and you're and then when they come out with the new things you are like uh well why didn't you think of that before yeah yeah and i think that it's just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't wanna think about it yeah that's true and uh i just look at it as i don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something you know i want to feel like i at least tried yeah and i don't know it just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it then we'll be forced to it may be too late do they not ever i mean i don't know that much do they not ever burn trash or anything like very little that's another thing and if you ever know like i know Amway i only use a couple things form Amway that it says this is burnable material well then that's pollution that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it yeah i know i guess you run into the pollution factor yeah and then just like the glass bottles that that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in Texas and there's no place i can take glass to yeah so i still throw away a lot of glass truly sad yeah and then the packaging really grips me you buy something it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic  there it's beautiful it's wonderful i love it it's not January is it sunny today it's sunny there's a few light wispy little clouds floating around there's a light breeze it's about sixty three degrees oh nice it's wonderful my son and i have been out for a couple of walks today yeah really yeah yeah it's real nice has it been raining um it stopped raining let's see Monday Monday or Tuesday Monday it stopped raining it's been raining oh yeah yeah it's it was raining until yesterday here until then was it yeah and it's but it has been real icky well no it it rained Monday night it rained it stopped raining Monday night like Tuesday it was it was clear but it's been really nasty the clouds have been over cast even though it's been kind of warm so that it is muggy yeah that wasn't very good either did you get some snow a while back uh we did we got snow about a week and a half ago that's what i thought and it was it was really wild because uh the snow was um it didn't stick oh uh but it flurried and you could see it but it uh it didn't stick any huh yeah it was nice it turned into it was like rain it because it was warm even it was above freezing yeah wow but it was between uh just where the clouds were and where you know but when the snow got down here um-hum it was cold enough to freeze it and then it just stayed frozen it was wet snow i guess is what they call it when is starts thawing before it hits the ground yeah we haven't had anything like that really yeah it's only um it's only froze we have only had two freezes so far this winter but i think it is going to be a lot warmer soon oh yeah well i am wondering about the summer what is summer going to be like if winter is this temperate right we are bound to have a real dozy of a summer that's what i think but with all this rain all the all the flowers ought to be real pretty but i don't know i've i've had um i have Easter lilies that i grow in my back yard and they have already started up uh-huh wow and it's way too early yes it is for Easter lilies they shouldn't be up until March when the the flowers actually start to bloom yeah i've seen Day lilies uh not Day lilies daffodils around town uh and blooming already coming in bloom and blooming oh please yeah i i put down crocus this year thinking oh well it will get cold in January and February you know and i won't have to worry about it i don't think i am going to get crocus this spring you might not you might not no i don't think it got cold enough for them to come out but do you have the wild flowers up there we don't have as many wild flowers here as there are down toward Austin i use to go to school in San Marcus so i'm familiar with Austin and the area yeah they ought to be really pretty this year i think so i think the highways are going to be great yeah i'm ready to travel yeah we like to go out and take pictures of them and everything it they ought to be really off of two ninety especially is real nice oh uh-huh i agree that's a yeah my husband said with all the rain this year that it ought to be real real nice uh-huh i agree and it's be probably be wonderful out there well this kind of weather today i feel like getting outside well i'm wishing i'm i'm wishing i had made a picnic for my son and i put down a blanket or a a sleeping bag and had a picnic outside yeah that would've been nice yeah that that's what'll be great when all the wild flowers come out take yourself out a picnic and right well the weather man said it's suppose to start raining again for us tomorrow oh really and through the weekend we're not suppose to get it until about Monday Sunday night or Monday oh maybe it'll might we might not get it here when well we've uh yeah we have well they told us it was going to rain today too we don't have the most reliable weather men oh i guess not no they said it was going to rain today although they revise they revise our weather report about every other day it changes it seems like but hey have been saying it was going to rain yeah Saturday afternoon but now we are under a big high yeah or high pressure yeah so we're um we're going to be stable for a while they say through Sunday oh good yeah that'd be maybe we might get some of that it seems like there's a line there at Waco where it'll come to Waco and then go and we won't get it uh-huh yeah or it'll go up as far as Waco and then move over and Dallas won't get it uh-huh you know but uh i hope it will be pretty this weekend i i can't wait cause it's rained oh i know for the last four or five weekends here it's just been miserable and i want to get outside and barbecue uh-huh um-hum exactly that'll be fun but uh yeah i can't wait  uh it was about the Vietnam right the Vietnam War yeah well uh guess uh i'm twenty three are you older than i am yeah i'm forty one so i would uh so you probably have a better opinion of of what well i uh was in college when the war escalated to it's height and uh huh i guess my feeling is consistent with that of uh the general public that it was unfortunate event uh it's real interesting to think about it in the context of this new movie JFK which is right apparently linking the Kennedy assassination to his decision to his uh uh the apparently people uh who worked for Kennedy say he didn't decide that he was gonna um-hum pull out of Vietnam was not going to commit more troops that that had nothing to do with the assassination of those people say but they that he had come to that conclusion um yeah i think it was uh particularly in light of recent events a really unfortunate mistake Communism was self destructing even then and uh the history of Vietnam which has been uh represented in a number of different commentaries and documentaries one on the public broadcasting system uh it seems that it just didn't have to happen and i think uh its a valuable uh if painful lesson for this country yeah i mean looking back now know what we know now i mean it was just a complete disaster right at the time i wasn't that uh wasn't that sure i i i really didn't know enough about it and wasn't that politically active uh but it was um apparently something that could've been avoided and i you know i i look at wars generally as falling into that category um people are beginning to wonder whether or not the uh the Gulf War could've been avoided even though that was a remarkably painless war and as wars go um-hum yeah i just think that the Gulf War was just something that was really um i know it's i kind of look at it as a little bit of propaganda in a way because i mean we basically went in and spent i don't know how many billions of dollars and right just beat up on a third world country really inferior yeah inferior army that was just wanting wanting to quit and didn't have any food and i mean it's just i don't know how much pride one can really take in that and well i think what what's uh i i guess i'd use the word relevant to the Vietnam War question is that the Vietnam War was apparently avoidable too it was a time when Ho Chi Minh apparently came to the United States and said look if you're willing to provide me with support all i wanna do is unify Vietnam um-hum and uh he was turned away by Truman um so it's hum a painful lesson i guess one that we're beginning to learn i'm really impressed by how much effect some of these movies have had on public consciousness the JFK movie's cause causing one person after another to call for the release of the documents that have been sealed oh yeah that's just um did you see any of the Vietnam Wars um any of the Vietnam war movies i've seen uh you know Apocalypse Now and um uh what was the one with um Christopher Waken and um oh the Deer Hunter The Deer Hunter yeah i've you know and the just a lot of other i guess inferior ones made but i mean as far i think Apocalypse Now and um Deer Hunter were just yeah those two yep just incredible movies you know Deer Hunter's a little bit more of a incident but yeah they were they've yeah well they were both remarkable films as a matter of fact there's a new film out about the Vietnam War about the making of Apocalypse Now which itself is suppose to be a great yeah have you is it good yeah Heart of Darkness yeah i've seen that that was uh it's great they had it on Showtime um before they released it to theaters fact around the summer and uh it's really something it's almost it it's just as entertaining if not more entertaining than a film is because it's that's what people say i'm really looking forward to seeing his wife apparently made it from documentary right she just shot documentary you know had like a little hand held camera and you know the whole thing's been edited together but when Martin Sheen had his heart attack it's just amazing what you know Frances is just oh is is that on film did that that get captured on film it it doesn't capture the actual event it captures him getting uh some treatment after it happened but she had a tape reporter running when he was talking on the phone about it and he's just literally freaking out i mean about he's more concerned about the you know how because he's as the whole time i guess when it was being made um i was just a kid back then but i guess it's just the people back in America just were hearing about it how it was just such a disaster during this is like the last thing he need is is for Marty to have a heart attack i mean you'll you'll love it i mean it's it's really great um right right right yeah well i the thing i think is really neat about  tell me what's the last movie you saw the last movie i saw in a theater was Hook Hook and uh it was very enjoyable um i'm trying to think there's a lot of movies i want to see oh yeah there seems to be a lot out especially around Christmas but we were kind of busy and didn't really get out to see any of them but it but what the last one you saw uh the last one i went to the theater to see was uh The Doctors hum and i thought that was real good but i rent movies all the time yeah we do too yeah the last that seems to be the way we do it any more i saw Dying Young over the weekend is that good that's with um i'm trying to think who's in that and last week uh what's her name Julia Roberts oh okay okay and uh it was just really good i knew it was going to be sad and i knew somebody was going to be dying yeah but it was is still has an interesting plot twist to it um we want to go see JFK yeah trying to i mean i have heard lots of reviews and stuff but i still want to see it just to i have been putting off to go see that one but my wife wants to see it too and uh it just seems so much trouble any more to go to a theater yeah it is and Plano has grown so much that um you know the restaurants and stuff are all so crowded now you use to be able to get out to get a quick bit to eat and go see a movie and it's just not that way any more yeah so we usually stay in on Friday nights and rent movies and i think probably the last rented movie i saw well no i take that back it wasn't rented i think it was just on HBO at my in-laws house or something but it was Hunt for Red October oh yeah i and i love that movie yeah i went uh i went to the theater to see that one and then i rented it i think when it came out too yeah oh that would've been a good one that would've been a good one to see yeah yeah but renting them just doesn't do them justice sometimes sometimes you're right it doesn't uh but it beats watching what ever is on television yeah that's true i mean i think like uh Dances with Wolves just you know would be a good movie on television but it you know the scenery and everything was so beautiful on the screen yeah we had a pretty quiet Christmas at our house this year and one of the things that we've been putting off for a long time was to was to rent all of the Godfather movies oh really so we did that and all of them did you it was uh you know like fourteen hours of Godfather stuff oh wow in one night no it took us about three days but okay i was going to say that's a long movie yeah well it was still lots i'm telling you when that that the last hour you know uh number three we felt like we were Italians we were eating Italian snacks and drinking wine and we were thinking this has got to stop how many are there there's three three okay yeah it's almost something around fourteen hours well that's not as bad as as uh Friday the 13th or Planet of the Apes or uh but my i think my favorite though are old movies black and white yeah uh i like the old prison movies in the thirties and things like that it's just i don't know there's just something about them i think it reminds me of my childhood really not i just remember when i was little in the summer we got to stay up all night and that's what was on um-hum um-hum so somehow that reminds me again with all my brothers and sisters and you know making popcorn and making homemade pizzas in the middle of the night and stuff so we went through a stage where we rented a lot of the um Alfred Hitchcock the you know like North by Northwest and Rear Window and all those and those are really good i mean you know the old black and whites and yeah i watched uh Doris Day Retrospective on uh CBS the other night just i thing about her and different movies she'd been in and i realized how much i missed the old Doris Day Rock Hudson movies yeah oh yeah they were just always i can remember never missing one at the theater hum and because they were like fantasy and and they were an escape from the real world i think and even if i see one on now or somewhere i'll want to watch it so um-hum yeah oh they're those are some movies and they come on uh every now and then are you still there yeah i am still here yes okay it got real quiet i didn't know yeah i was just kind of there was no static or anything i thought no i am in a rest area and i was just kind of looking someone went by there i i thought i'd lost you so you are headed up to Tennessee yeah uh to Tennessee it's my mother's eighty fifth birthday where about uh Kingsport oh okay that's right yeah um i work for TI and i have traveled to Johnson City before and i you know where that is oh yeah are they still there um most of it was sold off to Simon's but there is still about five hundred employees that work that are TI yeah yeah i remember back when they first open in the early seventies there i worked at Univac and uh just down the road and boy all the everybody just oh  uh what uh you have some ideas on the to help out the President here i think that one of the things they're going to have to do is go back and take some serious look at what's important and what has a return on investment uh there's an awful lot of federal programs that uh they put a million dollars in it and it probably does a couple of hundred dollars worth of good right i i think they are going to be a lot more selective on on what they throw money at and there's some things some programs that just don't seem to be working at all uh an awful lot of the social programs and welfare programs they're just seem to be self perpetuating and uh certainly in a lot of the state and local regulations that are involved just force individuals into perpetuating the same activity and gives them no incentive whatever to solve their own problems right people get get where they depend on the benefit and they don't have much interest and there is no uh uh enforcing uh ability i think to make sure that it doesn't get continued there's there's a lot of waste as a result i think of that well some of the things that happen in welfare programs that uh they are inclined not to give welfare or reduce welfare payments if there is a uh male present in the family yeah so that's resulted in uh the family dissolving the husband is thrown out of the house so that they collect the welfare yeah and uh then the children are raised under the single parent circumstance without uh the father roll around well uh i and uh they wind up doing exactly the same thing yeah i think there's uh there's a good opportunity if they'll take advantage of it with the with the the defense needs not as great as they use to be uh if and combine the savings there with with the savings in all these uh give away programs and and then waste that's in welfare and a lot of other programs i think they can start to get a handle on on the budget though what i am afraid is they will just continue wasting money the way they have and and uh throw throw potential savings into uh more programs that don't do any good i think we can also do a lot to eliminate an awful lot of paper work and superfluous regulation well there was there was was a study i don't know if you heard of it it was the Grace Commission I know that um-hum uh and it it he was uh a private uh individual and he did a study on on cutting waste out of government and he came up with i forget the figure but it was a tremendous amount of savings that could be cut out without really cutting benefits uh just the waste that went on you know yeah well i know that uh well it seems like just ten or fifteen years ago when we were writing a proposal to work on some program we would sit down with an old Freidman mechanical calculator and work out a one or two page cost proposal uh-huh and now when we write a proposal for the same magnitude of program we have a Compaq three eighty six and it runs for about three days and generates about three hundred pages of uh nonsense to for somebody to go read right yeah you wonder if all that is necessary and that's the same in government i guess it's is it all necessary you know and uh you wonder if anybody every reads it and if they do why yeah yeah it it perpetuates a lot more jobs i think is what it does and uh and i i think one of the problems we're having with uh schools uh is sort of the same factor that uh but but when i was going to school we had uh a principal assistant principal and everybody else was teaching except the janitor uh-huh and now it seems like there's uh as many administrators and administrative assistants as we have teachers yeah well and uh the number of pupils per class has gone up by about fifty or sixty percent well with the economy overall getting bad a lot of companies have had to really go into cost cutting and streamlining and that's something the government has really never tried hard to do uh they just have to learn to live within their budget i think and and not uh allow this bunch to get out of hand like they have um-hum uh there's no no need in spending all of this money on on a lot of welfare and these programs when you're going into debt to do it and i think that the government also goes overboard uh on the way they do things uh we have a a new sewage treatment facility near here that's uh one of the fine EPA approved things that does a super job of cleaning up the water and they have an administrative building associated with it that uh has  i i don't have a lot of things that invade my every everyday privacy probably the the one thing that i feel is a is a bother is uh soliciting over the phone from uh either for donations for different things or in the local area uh we have quite a bit of this i understand there's a a law now where some companies are unable to do this after the first of January but i haven't i really don't know too much about that but i really other than that i don't really have anything that uh i feel invades my my privacy how about you i feel that the mail is also it's the telephones and the mails that get me i think the mails all these ads and things that they send and there should be a limit on that also uh-huh yeah well that's that's good uh i don't think not only financially but it's costing me and us really in advertising we're paying for all that junk that we throw in the yes i you bet and once you order something it seems like you get on their list and they send everything that's right and they have a and then you get your list there of privacy you know out of that comes the um and then then being able to use your name uh-huh uh-huh and that's invading your privacy to me now that is one of the biggest one another big one that's uh-huh yeah taking your name from lists uh that that's true and i don't know how you you stop that if you order anything at all and then use your credit card or get anything from any mail order catalogs or anything then everybody starts sending the stuff i know it is it's outrageous how you get the piles of it and uh and then even it even even gets to the point where they um yeah oh they can mess up your credit bad with it you know as far as your with your um uh-huh when you get on all these lists and all they can invade that part of it uh-huh right and i don't know what can be done about that but uh i'm sure that this is and i know there is a number i think that or uh the post office you can send in a number and i don't have it myself in fact i thought of getting it my sister has it and said we she'd give it to me and she lives in Ohio uh-huh and uh there is a number that you can send or a place that you can send to the post office and give them your address and tell them you don't want anymore of this and i just haven't done in fact she was just telling me about it recently well that's great that's good to hear i'll so i thought i might check with her on it and get that number and uh-huh well i have a son and uh and have a lot of that junk mail stopped because i really that hm yes well that that would be great i mean you know it's a big irritant to me but yes it is like you say we're paying for it one way or the other uh-huh we are and the postage and uh and and door-to-door soliciting can be another uh-huh we don't have a lot of that uh where i live uh very little but i would imagine that where you live in a larger area don't you yeah it's a it's as much as a phone call you know invading your privacy and we do hear in a lot of it in Richardson there's quite a bit of it uh-huh well it really would be and and then the that really invades it plus uh you you just trying to settle down to do something and then uh here they come and they yeah i did have to laugh though they had the um they had the invasion of privacy law uh for weekends now here in Richardson they signed me to see uh on Saturdays and Sundays there is no soliciting allowed allowed uh-huh and they even stopped the little Brownies and Girl Scouts from selling their cookies and that really got us and we laughed about it because with one of the um editorials on it was oh oh my goodness yeah it was great the guy went on about how the little Brownie came or Girl Scout came to the door and the police arrested her for selling their cookies and it was kind of a cute yes oh wow yeah pun against that part of it but you know where do you stop it's true i'm sure we must have um well i'm i'm sure we have a law in uh in Brigham City on that because uh we very very seldom really uh have anyone coming around but once in a while somebody will come in and then uh the word gets out and then nobody in the neighborhood will answer the door but uh oh really uh-huh oh well that's good we don't have maybe oh two or three times a year so there's there's got to be something uh i'm sure that that uh-huh prohibits them from doing that uh-huh uh-huh but uh all of these are really irritants and things that we really don't need now that's true and it is an invasion and each time it's a breakdown of our system you know each one is a breakdown of our systems uh-huh yes of your privacy your own privacy and uh that can be very irritable that's true and then some of the advertisements on television some of the things uh that you might want or records or something i dare sent uh i dare sent order any of that stuff because then  okay i work with uh a lot of students and uh in my uh occupation talking to them about college and going to colleges i think uh um-hum the advice that i give to would give to uh parents i've had four sons five sons that have gone to college uh to uh college i think uh one of the main things is that they they choose a local college that uh or university that will go along with their goals as far as what degrees they want to go into and they if they're in the local area they don't have to pay out of state tuition and all of those things and uh yeah that's certainly helpful and go ahead say your last suggestion there about staying within state i realize that there are a lot of schools unless uh uh the student has a real specialty and there oh maybe are one or two universities that are highly respected in that field they really ought to try to stay within their state i mean uh-huh financing in universities now is getting a very very high yes it is and they can't help themselves on that either so it certainly is an advantage to stay within your own state um-hum uh that that's uh kind of the the advice that i give and then uh they need to take a look at the uh courses uh the courses of study and uh how it would go into their their major minor field uh yeah what kind of placement uh they have in the particular area you know i had one son who uh went to a smaller college uh to uh went out in the uh premed area um-hum but they had an excellent record of placing uh their students in medical schools after they finished the program and he was that's very important right he got early acceptance to a to medical school after he finished and uh if he would've gone to uh say the state uh it would be the University of Utah if he would've gone there uh i don't know whether he'd got accepted to medical school there or not well that was certainly uh good advice to get him to go to a school who follows up and has such a reputation that others are happy to get their students that um-hum that means that the quality of what he was taught must be very very high yes uh and that's good for him too regardless of where he works he has uh a top level of information that will last him the rest of his life basically um-hum and you you can do this for any of the uh any uh university or or for any of the students that are planning uh take a look at uh their final goals at least hopefully they've got a goal of what area they want to go out in and then uh if it's law school or if it's uh medical or whatever there are different uh colleges and universities usually within the state that uh have a little little better placement record or or getting them into into those higher degree or higher areas of education um-hum well we have that same situation here i'm i'm a retired professor at Penn State i see uh-huh and uh the field i worked in was acoustics and we have an acoustics department here and we have lots of students several hundred i guess in in acoustics and they have an excellent opportunity to follow through on their fields because our university is well known for it's research in addition to uh teaching obviously if we can do um-hum you bet high class research we must be well trained and and uh available to teach the students well um-hum and uh that would be school a school that the parents uh should seek out for their uh students if they're interested in that that field and yes and where it's well known uh the word gets out and that that might be a a case where even if it was out of state and they had to pay a little higher tuition then it would be well worth the the uh to to go to to Penn State yes yes because Penn Penn State is very well known in uh many of its uh many of its fields and uh we we get a lot we do we only we get our sort of say we get state uh students not only from out of state but from all over the world um-hum yes i mean they they they really come here we have a very high uh percentage of foreign students because Penn State is pretty well tops in many of its fields um-hum you bet and we have doubled in size in the last fifteen twenty years i guess um-hum well that's very important in in a choice of a college or university that they look at those aspects uh wherever they might be um-hum and if it's uh financially if they can do that that's that's great yes that's true but they they need to know about the the costs and uh how they're going to be able to pay for this whether they can get students loans or are their parents are able to help or whatever but uh uh the bottom line is uh the the college or university that's gonna give them the best training prepare them for life yes and then the basic thing is that you started out earlier to say the the bottom line is to give your  declined that San Francisco has more crime than Texas than Plano Texas yeah i sure am it's a it's a difficult question i don't know that i uh can easily come up with an answer to what can be done i don't think there is an answer of what would make crime go away there's no such thing i think probably drugs have a lot to do with crime in our society today so yeah i think you're right have you ever had your house broken into no no i haven't either it's it's hard to know actually whether the crime um impact would be better or would would decrease or would increase if there were some changes in the way drugs are legislated i don't know if yeah i have uh an opinion yet about uh legalization of certain kinds of drugs but uh-huh boy there's certainly a lot connected with that you know that's for sure organized crime as well as that's for sure huh i've never really been a victim of a crime and i've never had my car stolen or my house broken into or any of that so well i guess i've always lived in suburbs i don't know if that has anything to do with it or not but yeah i grew up in a pretty small town and i'm not sure that um the size of the community or the general appearances safety really has as much to do with it because because you're seen as an enclave You might get hit by somebody from the outside anyway yeah um i guess on a on a local level uh i i was thinking when i heard the question about major changes in the country today but it's probably a little easier now that i think about it if i look at what an individual could do and obviously if you have lights on and you have uh uh a timing system for your lights in your own home you're going to reduce the risk of being broken into right there's so many things that you can do in that way and you know going into parking lots with with your keys out being prepared you know being on the defensive right right looking less like a victim right neighborhoods watching each other yeah we have a neighborhood crime watch where i am where did you grow up yes in a southern California suburb It was outside of Long Beach kind of near Huntington Beach uh-huh yeah well my girls and i were just just down there this Christmas they play soccer and so we were down in that same area oh really yeah yeah i've lived in San Francisco for about thirteen years now and um probably have learned by but uh indirect and direct experiences about things to do to you know avoid those kind of situations but i think part of it's just as you grow yeah as you mature you you recognize um how to present yourself in a public situation so that you don't look like you are a victim a potential victim that's right yep it's a hard thing to communicate to kids isn't it it sure is do you have children i have a two year old yeah they're not afraid of much at two no no but you know as a child we were able to uh ride our bikes around the neighborhood and go to our friends and those are things that i'm not sure i'd be comfortable with when she gets to bike riding age you know yep i can understand that you know as we were traveling back from that same toc soccer tournament i was telling you about we stopped in Mesa Arizona uh-huh and i was just amazed at the freedom that those kids felt they just don't have i mean even here in Plano Texas i worry when my kids walk you know a block uh-huh and we talked to some of our relatives there and they said you know we just don't worry about that there aren't kidnappings and there aren't there isn't that element here yet that's interesting how large a community is that um i don't really know it's not real big it's right outside of Tucson uh-huh and and Plano what would you say is the population uh i don't know that either it's because sometimes it's hard to you know i i look at small towns that have had problems with kidnappings and i think well the you know they're not on the edge of some large metropolis Um you know it's hard to even yeah look at the factors that influence that happening why why in that particular you know why it would happen here and not there uh-huh uh-huh yep i guess you just have to kind of look for a family environment and and neighborhood and hope for the best you know and just uh-huh do you find yourself teaching your children things that uh you you know that they need to do but you didn't have perhaps in the way of level of awareness at an early age sure sure it and it's so frightening because you have to teach them to be scared all the time uh-huh uh-huh how how do they respond to that when you tell them about kidnappings at what age were they ready for that and to really be cautious well they don't know any other way they don't know any other way i mean they weren't raised when i was when you didn't worry about that everyone worries about that now so they just assume that you'll always have to be on your guard uh-huh how old were were they when you introduced that subject and this oh real young i mean i can remember when my my oldest daughter is thirteen today and when she was just three i took her to the Sun Valley Mall do you know where that is uh-huh huh yeah i grew up there in Concord uh-huh anyway and um she had gotten lost and it started right then you know and every person i would see that had a little girl you know tucked under their arm i'd run you know oh gosh a scary experience to see if that was her oh yeah  how do you get your news coverage well um most of what i do is um listen to the news in the morning when i'm heading to work um we get uh we have two different stations here that run uh National Public Radio and i really enjoy the format in the morning and the evening when i'm driving home from work so that's where i get most of my stuff uh uh-huh oh that's pretty nice yeah we we also subscribe to the newspaper of course so we get the Washington Post here and it's a pretty interesting newspaper yeah right and uh so it's you know it's it's uh between the two i generally do okay every great once in a while i manage to uh listen to the evening news but not very often how about yeah that's just about all i get is the evening news and the and the newspaper sometimes i wish the evening news was like an hour long instead of thirty minutes yeah i don't blame you it's it's uh it's but that would be nice to have uh um you know all is it an all news uh radio station yeah and it actually well no i it's i guess what is it it's um it's kind of a talk radio station it's run by a university here called American University or at least that the the general program that i listen to National Public Radio itself is um uh-huh a uh uh a syndicated thing that's run by a group that operates here in Washington uh but if you have any public radio stations in your area chances are pretty good um-hum especially in Austin come to think of it uh that you're going to be able to get it down there uh i i guess i never i never really tried that it probably is on the AM i know it's not on FM yeah well i don't know whatever your you know it it the normally the public radio stations are gonna be down at the low end of the dial you know around eighty eight and uh and so forth and and uh yeah this uh the two radio stations that run here one is a classical station and the other i guess if you had to categorize it's kind of a bluegrass station or something um but uh yeah that that's i'm i'm dead certain some station in your area carries it because every once in a while they'll do little special features on Austin it's a real interesting radio program because they they don't just cover yeah well it's probably picking up um KLBJ that's a real famous um-hum um uh Lady Bird used to own it radio station here but um they're not so much news as they are um uh as far as musicians and and things going on around Austin um-hum um-hum um well that's very interesting well this comes on right in the evening as i'm driving home you know um-hum and um what they do is they they give you uh about a five to ten minute news uh broadcast and then for the rest of the half hour they usually divide it up into two or three segments where they they cover um-hum um topics either of current interest or every once in a while they'll just do kind of an indepth reporting on on some uh particular thing like yeah like perhaps for instance how a particular city is doing or something along those lines yeah it's uh some subject yeah well not bad that sounds pretty interesting yeah it's real good and it it it uh the other thing is is is my politics are kind of liberal and and um so they have a tendency being public radio to sort of take a look at things from the populist point of view as opposed to being terribly sympathetic to the government although the you you've got to give them credit they do a great job of showing both sides of the story right and uh they aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves either which is something i really admire so if you watch the evening news which of the news commentators do you tend to like the most oh i guess Dan Rather i'll switch around i'm not really partial you know one like Monday i might have one and Tuesday i might have another one you know just to get a different view you know or just someone different but uh yeah yeah i'm the same way but the the evening news on TV it's it's really it's so short that you just uh i don't feel like you wind up getting enough and yet have you ever watched the uh McNeil Lehrer report on public TV yeah um-hum i sort of feel like that news program drags on too long yeah yeah it's a little draggy and uh with you know with their little round table discussions and all that sort of stuff and i must admit i i used to try to watch it used used to make me feel like oh well this is uh something i should be watching yeah until it gets a little boring though i know there is something better on you know yeah exactly and so it it's pretty nice in that the newspaper here it's it's it's only you only have one newspaper and um it's it's kind of biased um-hum but um it it's all right which way which which way does it lean is it conservative or yeah it's very conservative i would say it's very conservative but you know being it's only you you don't have one in the evening and you don't have a choice um-hum um-hum and you know i don't i don't like that but other i have uh uh small newspaper community um that's oh it's it's um uh just in this general area it serves maybe twenty thousand people and uh it's free and it's real nice um-hum oh wow yeah i really like it you yeah it it's like the small hometown newspaper you know you can put your kid's picture in there if they had a birthday or or something like that you know or some that's good yeah well that's interesting  well i guess we're uh uh forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution i hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars and low polluting fuels fuels are being experimented with ethanol and other types of fuels yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from i you know i assume that the major sources are cars and factories but i or sources that's what i would think i don't know for sure i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from what comes over the border from us right yeah i think the automobile definitely is an area uh any any industry that burns you know and then i don't know about chemical pollution i'm not real into that as far as how it affects the air i know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution they have offices that are too well insulated they found people are getting sick yeah but i don't know if that affects outside you know i i think seems to think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories yeah the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes um i guess there's been a lot of pressure to um yeah do away with the CFCs in these spray bottles which has been a real problem right yeah that is well that's destroying the ozone isn't it yeah again i that's what i hear and and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there's a hole in the ozone or not but at last i heard it was uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially yeah that's it it's kind of scary well it is scary and i think it will uh continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively yeah we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment yeah i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces i i i'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't do that in Los Angeles they're apparently going to they've passed laws that for habit for example people using i think it will barbecues gasoline lawn mowers uh-huh um and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles and it's gotten bad in Denver and and uh it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky right and people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars and our economy seems to and this i think is one of the big problems right yeah in this area too since you know in Texas we're so spread out we have to drive so far but i know in Colorado i have witnessed that where it just uh yeah it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts but we're even getting it here we can drive into when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas and you can tell it in the mornings too my husband likes to go out and jog and there's just a brown fog here and we don't even have any mountains that are holding it in yeah but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets well that makes a lot of sense i mean i i hadn't thought about it that way but it it you don't have to have mountains there stopping it yeah and uh they make uh making more and more high-rise buildings and uh so yeah we can comment and we didn't see this a few years ago it was pretty clear here no and i think yeah and i think that that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is a is an organism of sorts and that there is a a whole right set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it and uh we're going to feel it and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy um-hum uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars and in in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing people heavily for using their cars yeah yeah and uh i'm i have a little sports car that i enjoy using and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but i think uh we're gonna have to make some fundamental changes and and i'm i'm not sure how long it's gonna take or what it's gonna take because they keep saying that the economy is gonna depend on how many cars and houses we sell yes and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that it's a lot of waste but  well how polluted do you think we are down here uh well i guess we're not as bad as a lot of places but uh we're out here on the Great Plains so there's some place for it to go i think so uh-huh yeah i guess so and it's still a little bit flat around here and there's no specific mountains to hem it in yeah uh we used to live in California and although we were not in the smoggy area of Los Angeles we used to visit down there and honestly you could you could you could see the smog hanging over the city it's just about uh yeah i've heard that yes we can and a friend of mine lives out in San Bernardino and uh uh just beyond San Bernardino is the desert and separating San Bernardino from the desert are some mountain ranges and when the smog gets very very bad in Los Angeles it moves out there and then is bounded by that mountain range and literally hangs over San Bernardino um-hum it's a very very strange thing yeah i think that's probably the problem with any of the coastal cities i think that's what New York has such a problem with um-hum yeah although you know you know the the the way that the air masses move around the the sea coast uh and it really just like making and stuff just hang over whatever cities happen to be on the coast um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah i i do think that's what's one of the real problems although i grew up in New York and i never noticed this kind of pollution as i i saw in uh you know southern California i don't think it's as bad yeah and then um-hum i know there's some because in my visits to New York i noticed that my i wear i'm a contact lens wearer and i noticed that i have to uh take out my contacts yes um-hum oh clean them yeah i can't wear them as many hours during the day as i can other places but you know i mean that's not just New York i mean that's also Europe you know Rome is the worst city i've ever been at uh oh um-hum uh oh uh-huh course now i hear that uh you now like Mexico City is real bad for that oh i see well i've never been down there and also places in Brazil like Sao Paulo you know is that right well what are they doing down there that causes such a thing what kind of industries do they have yeah well they have no they have no pollution controls whatsoever i see so whatever industry they do have even though they don't have as much as we have they just like fire away you know um-hum i see um they control nothing i mean it's like it's like you know the situation it you know Brazil even though there's there's in Brazil uh it it's my understanding because i have some friends there that are Brazilian uh there's an upper-class and a lower-class and no middle-class oh i see um-hum um-hum and so you know the lower class is working uh in the factories which pollute the air and the upper classes make the money off of the factories um-hum um oh i see uh-huh um and so pollution is a big problem for all of the you know underdeveloped countries because they're not going to they're not going to start instituting regulations that are going to impede their whatever industry they happen to have um profits i guess um-hum yeah uh-huh which you know that's kind of going to be the end result you know Bush i was reading in the Wall Street Journal today you know Bush's moratorium on regulatory um-hum um-hum uh things right now that are going to impede business the first effect that it has had is the EPA had some new regs up um-hum um-hum for um congressional approval that had to do with making industries uh itemize uh different types of things that they were you know um putting into the air you know part of the clean air act you know which is to help enforce the clean air act and so that of course you know the moratorium on new regulations has you know hamstrung that um-hum right um-hum that's right uh-huh i i know that a lot of the European countries and Mexico and the South American countries simply do not have the governmental regulations and i think that unless the government is uh on top of this or at least instrumental in trying to do something that nothing is really going to be done by private industry until they you know get that push it really wasn't done in our country absolutely not not any profit driven industry because you know they're just absolutely not going to you know sit still for anything that's going to take away from profits i mean we're we're living in the greed generation here i mean there is no there is you know um um-hum yeah uh-huh um-hum um-hum uh-huh the greed generation oh what a terrible thing to say uh-huh sure i mean you know i mean i've heard i've heard that before and i'm now beginning to believe it because um-hum um-hum you know what i mean i have some limited involvement in some in some what you would call i guess environmental type entities i'm an attorney and i write letters for a number of environmental um um-hum um-hum oh i see um-hum uh purposes and you know it it is amazing to me that people can sit here and look at the situation that we have globally and say you know what the hell um-hum oh i know um um-hum because uh you know it's it's really apparent to me especially living in a city the size of Dallas that the wide open spaces that where always the justification for why worry you know are going away um-hum um-hum um-hum um oh  okay well have you had to return anything lately well yes i did i returned a number of things yesterday at uh JC Penney but uh oh but it wasn't um it was clothing uh-huh and um the blouse was uh supposed to be a size six but the shoulder drooped over my shoulder and it wasn't you know the style of the blouse it just i think it was sized wrong but you know it was a nice blouse but and um i took some uh lingerie back that wasn't well i the size that i usually buy did not fit in their in their brand it was too small um uh but as far as large items go like appliances or things like that no yeah we haven't had to take anything back although i wonder you know if they sometimes i think things are made to not last as long as they used to you know so you have to buy them more often uh and my phone is making a weird noise um i'm trying to think we have we just moved into our house about two years ago and we had to buy um uh-huh refrigerator and washer and dryer and all that and so far we haven't had any um um-hum any major problems haven't had although i keep hearing noises this morning that make me wonder if our washer is about to to uh you know well uh i would like to comment on my washer um um my washer if it gets out of balance it makes a horrible noise oh uh-huh and you have to make sure that your clothes are balanced but um it was doing it quite frequently and so i had a repairman come out and look at it and he said well you need this and so done to this machine and i said oh really and i he says let me show you and i said i said oh yeah i see that it really needs something bad you know but it didn't uh have an affect on the performance of the machine huh what what it was the um it was a cap after your um after the body of the machine was in place it was under that so it wasn't visible um-hum oh and it was out of sight um-hum and it was rusting out hum although i don't have any rust in my clothes and i said okay how much do you want to uh do this repair work and he told me almost two hundred and fifty dollars and i said hey i can go buy a new one for that price oh oh and i said and i said no i'm not gonna do that i said the performance of the machine is not affected by that part and i said and that's not that's not the cause of the imbalance i said i just have to be more careful how i put my clothes in and um so that was two years ago and my machine is still functioning fine um-hum so i didn't you know and he wanted thirty five dollars for a service call and i says hey wait a minute they didn't tell me that when i called and i said i'm not paying it um-hum i says if they had told me up front i would have paid it but since they did not say ma'am there's a thirty five dollar service call but they didn't and i says i refuse to pay it and so he he had called his office and told them what i said and i i was released from that service charge um wow what a mess so you know they were they to me that was underhanded i wouldn't have minded if they had said okay uh we have that service is thirty five dollars or whatever they they charge maybe it's different um yeah uh charges for different things i don't know but it seems to me a service call would be kind of universal for anything um-hum right and then they get into the nitty gritties of charges for whatever you've got wrong with your you write them oh they could make lots of bucks that way oh we haven't had any yeah they really could we haven't had to have anything fixed like that although we do my husband orders a lot from Land's End um catalog yes oh they're a fantastic company to deal with yeah yeah we've we've had real good luck with them for the most part but they have changed their sizing somewhat and because i had ordered a women's blouse and i wear about a six but i usually like to order the next size up oh uh-huh um-hum and i had ordered a um uh one of those little polo shirts um um-hum and it's really pretty small and i hardly ever wear it but so i was trying to decide what size to order this time and i went ahead and ordered the same size and it is like two sizes larger i mean it i love it because it you know now they make things a little bit bigger to where they are not as fitted you know but my husband ordered oh he orders pants dress shirts oh my  as Texas El Paso uh they were undefeated until uh Thursday night when they played the University of Utah here in Salt Lake City and uh oh really hum they were beaten by uh a last minute three point shot oh my gosh and uh so it kind of opened things up a little bit they play uh Brigham Young University tonight uh-huh and uh i i'm pretty sure uh they really got a good team this year and i think do do they do they traditionally have a good team or is this sort of an unusually thing uh yes they do uh they usually uh they're usually the one or two in the in the WAC conference and they're the only team from Texas huh huh huh yeah see we're it's they're actually in the University of Texas system and i don't i don't even know anything about them i'm here in Austin we have uh University UT Austin uh-huh right which is which i mean i just generally go to the University of Texas right the the Longhorns um uh-huh and uh yeah who's doing the who's leading the conference actually actually i don't know right now Longhorns aren't having quite the year that they had hoped um they they had a a star forward that that was disqualified because of uh i see oh of something i guess as he was leaving his junior college they uh some supporter gave him a car or something and uh oh oh i see that kind of fouled things up plus maybe yeah it sure did because they were they had a real good start and then and then and then ended up you know they they're they're holding on but it's not it's not gonna be a a season like they had last year when they went to the NCAA um-hum right well last year the University of Utah went and uh they had two of their stars uh uh-huh got hurt the beginning of the season this year and that's why uh uh Texas El Paso is uh is in the University of Utah went to the NC Double A's last year and they got into the final sixteen i guess but um-hum yeah uh UTEP like i say is doing real well and it's it's too bad that they have something like that did they restrict the uh the Longhorns as far as uh being able to play in any of the no it it it something had happened outside of that you know and and it happened as as part of his junior college career junior college so it didn't affect their program other than loosing him yeah right that's too bad but no but they pulled him out of the out of the lineup you know and it was something he he reported himself or i mean they it wasn't a and and the NCAA uh immediately suspended him and then and then actually UT on his behalf filed a an injunction in the court system to allow him to continue to play which worked for a few games and then they then they pulled him in so yeah but oh that's too bad yeah but they've been having uh i mean last last last year they had a real good team they had every they had a new coach Tom Penders come in um about i guess about three years ago um-hum and and the the program had been in a long a long decline you know for for years they i guess back when Abe Lemons was here they built quite a quite a tradition i see um-hum and then it it kind of went downhill for about for a couple of coaches and Penders has done a good job of getting it back on its feet and doing some you know playing some good basketball but good i know uh i was in Montana this last week and i saw the uh huh the women's team from uh Texas was playing uh Penn State yeah uh-huh and uh Penn State was ranked number eight i believe in the women's basketball and i i got to watch the half and then i had to leave on a flight uh back to Utah and i uh Texas was leading um-hum hum i don't know how they came out i don't know if you heard or not but uh i don't know yeah uh the women's program is quite interesting down here the the women's program here in in Austin um actually for a while it was was drawing bigger crowds than the men's program if you could imagine that they but they you know they just have have traditionally been a dominant a dominant basketball team i mean they've they've always been in the top oh yeah top eight in the country um and actually had a couple of years that they haven't been quite as strong but but uh um-hum the the Southwestern Conference uh they've been undefeated in the Southwestern they were no they aren't now but they had been undefeated in the Southwestern Conference for something like a five year streak or something i wish them well and had won the conference title for ten years in a row or something that's great and so that is they've they've that's that's quite a tradition here in in Texas but i'll say yeah uh that's uh last year the University of Utah that was the best season they'd had and uh the well the the coach had come in this Rick Majerus he'd come in uh he'd only been there a couple years and uh um-hum oh yeah um-hum really built the program and they were supposed to well they were rated up in the the first uh uh top ten this year until they lost their two of their their star players and uh through injuries uh-huh right and now they are uh they they did beat uh Texas El Paso and uh that was kind of strange i guess Texas El Paso was just weren't weren't uh up to speed yeah hitting and uh  okay have you had to return anything lately that you've bought um no not really i uh i may have had to have a a few minor repairs but i haven't bought anything of any consequences other than clothes and things and i will be in the very near future i'm gonna be buying a big computer and yeah um one of these eight millimeter camcorders oh yeah that'll be nice so i been i been studying these things but uh i haven't had to return too many things i i haven't either really i i i try to be very careful when i pick up something and and look it over to make sure that it looks like it's going to to work right right well i think it's gotten easier nowadays if you have something and you have to return it most most places are willing to you know go with the customer and i think it really turns down to picking who you want to buy from and i hate to say it but the field electronics devices that i buy the the ones in Japan in generally um-hum are much higher quality from working on uh yeah i know that i know i mean i hate to admit it but it's true they they they have a higher percentage of uh completely working models that get out to the public that's true that's true i haven't had to return anything that i can think of but uh you know with like radios and things they've become so cheap that even if they do break it's better just to go get another one than have it fixed you that's right you you were speaking of that about a week ago i bought myself a new digital watch you know uh-huh that was made in China uh-huh works just fine and it cost me four dollars yeah uh the stuff like that you know yes it's amazing isn't it yeah and i you know like television and stereos and things they're a lot cheaper if they're Japanese made yes you know i've i've gotten to the point where i think so but um i've had to return um i think a television one time and um uh the color went out but and it was like a month later and i didn't have any problem whatsoever which i think is good but uh-huh you know years ago you didn't never have to return anything everything worked for so long that's right and and and that's been really um way it's been for me for the last five or six years that i returned a TV set to be repaired but the problem was that uh we had a a lightning storm and oh yeah the lightning flashed in through the power and uh hurt something in it so it wasn't the set's fault at all it was just uh one of those circumstances um-hum well that's not bad at all well this is the first time i've ever gotten anybody outside of Texas no well i tell you most of my talks are in Texas that's true i but i've been i've been uh talked into um California twice in the last uh week or two really wow so it's uh it's nice but but i know how it is if you're gonna take care of Texas you have to live in Texas i suppose oh my heavens but let's see um i can't think of any other products i've taken back um clothes is about mainly what i've you know gotten lately and i think they've gone downhill yeah as as far as unless you it's you get what you pay for well we're being filled up with a lot of of stores that have huge quantities of of uh clothes and articles and you know we've got Wal-Marts and Gee Gee Bees and a whole bunch of things and right um-hum um-hum i don't know how we can support all of those things and the and and the only way they can stay alive is to buy cheaper products so they can put them on the market cheaper for the public that's true right and when that happens more of those products are likely to have uh inferior working ability and that's when you have to start returning them yeah yeah i agree with you it's kind of hard for the small man so yeah to make it you know with the the homemade thing that's right and i i i have a friend who does make uh beautiful furniture but he has to charge twice as much when you go to a store you know um-hum right if it looks beautiful and it's well made but people can't afford it wow that's pretty interesting yep hum let me think of something else here huh um i can't that's the only thing i can think of is clothes you know and and they're going up so high if you want a well made you know piece of clothing or in matter of fact furniture also you know you have to go you have to pay a lot more it's the old adage you get get what you pay for yes but um you know and you can get oh i know i bought a real cheap couch one time and it looked good but it was cheap and it didn't last very long you know do you i think the frame of it wasn't really good because it was probably mass produced hum you know actually i had some uh i bought a water softener for my home uh-huh and i didn't have to return it but it didn't work well and i finally i finally had to have the company come out and to check it out so i did have that problem uh-huh hum and it was a matter i think it was more of the installation was part of the problem than the machine itself do you have a problem with your water heater if you  well what hobbies do you have uh i crochet uh in in fact uh that's what i was doing when the phone rang oh you do are you making an Afghan yeah i'm making a baby Afghan uh for my daughter-in-law's sister-in-law who's expecting baby number one at age forty oh how wonderful oh my goodness so i feel uh i feel like she needs a goody well i have a sister-in-law who had a baby at age forty and i think again at forty three so she's uh-huh but i'm expecting too so on my first oh my yeah but um i don't uh the only thing i really have done in the past is um uh cross stitch and needlepoint um-hum um i had learned to crochet some things you know those little kitchen towels um-hum where you cut a towel in half and you sew the top part on so you can i mean crochet the top part of it so that you can attach it to an oven um-hum i've done that kind of stuff but i haven't done anything as big as an Afghan um-hum yeah do you do that often no i i really don't uh in fact this is the first thing i've crocheted in in uh some time um-hum but uh my grandmother taught me to crochet when i was five years old which is a long long long time ago hum so but i i don't knit my something goes wrong with my knitting the the gauge doesn't work um-hum yeah that uh um i just haven't been oh i think i learned how to do that when i was real young too um one thing i'd kind of like to learn how to do is um quilt um-hum um i see so many beautiful quilts and i have friends that that make them but you know there's just seems like there's not that amount of time nowadays hum i know i know you know because i work full-time outside the home yeah right now anyway i hope that'll change after the baby gets here but um-hum um-hum yeah and then you don't have the time because you're tending to the child um-hum but um it would be fun to learn how to do a few of those things yeah well i'll tell you how i sort of feel about it i i feel like uh of course in the olden days it was a matter of necessity right but it it i feel like now that you ought to do what you really like to do not just because your neighbor or your friends or your sister or somebody else is doing it hum uh the the if it's not real recreation it's it's it's not doing you any good yeah i think that's true um like some people make uh um decorating their house a hobby uh-huh and i have a friend who she and i both got into our houses around the same time and she's real she has a knack for that um-hum you know she made her own curtains and and i would love to be able to do all of that but i don't feel that i have quite the knack that she does um-hum um-hum and so uh you know we're thinking of hiring a decorator and stuff and i sometimes feel like you know that's a cop out but yet if if i i don't want to spend all the time and money and not and then feel like it looks real cheaply done or or you know not be satisfied with it um-hum um-hum but um my mother had that same knack you know for decorating and and it probably just comes with with age and with years of experience you know um-hum um-hum no no it doesn't it you either do it or or you either like it or you don't you either have a knack for it or you don't uh hum and and and uh again i i feel like that if there's something else that you'd rather do uh um-hum some people have a natural green thumb um-hum uh and uh if that's what you like to do fine but if you don't then uh get a second job and hire somebody yeah do something that you like to do uh um-hum life is too short uh i enjoy crocheting it it's real recreational recreation for me but uh and and i used to sew a lot but uh and i just don't have the time anymore i just now barely keep up with my mending um-hum um-hum but uh you know uh if you don't like to sew buy it readymade everything is available anymore and uh yeah yeah isn't that true we uh in fact mending it you even kind of has gone by the wayside for some most for many people if they get a hole in their sark sock they don't darn it they they uh hum-um dump it yeah uh throw it away and buy a new pair um-hum um-hum but um yeah there's a lot of things that i think that i'd like to do but i don't make the time to do them you know and i keep thinking oh well when this happens then i'll have more time to do it and um um-hum um-hum because i like committing a a great amount of time to something if i'm working on it  okay so have you had a project recently well as about as a matter of fact about two years ago right now uh i've completely and totally remodeled and restored my kitchen that's a project yeah i uh i tore out the uh walls all the way down to the studs and started over we had had a uh the kitchen we've we had was um uh-huh had a paneling in it dark paneling and and the cabinets were sort of old and it was just dark in here and old cabinets and uh counter tops um-hum at first i was we were just gonna paint the thing and you know how everything just sort of grows yes and uh so i ended up just just tearing tearing out the whole place and uh putting sheet rock in and building my own cabinets with ceramic tile on the counter tops and just everything new floor you must you must be pretty handy well uh i'm fairly good at it not not not enough to be professional or anything but i can do my own so you did the tile counter tops how do you like that yeah um-hum i love that it's it's really pretty we had just uh Formica and when i built the new cabinets uh i looked into this tile deal and i thought well you know i think we can probably do this um-hum and um it was uh it was not even not hard at all um it just i just followed the instructions the basic instructions that you use with the tile and uh they're not hard at all really it's just about anybody can do that um-hum did you have or do you have any problem with staining of the grout no not at all um uh what we what i've been doing is just using some like bleach and it uh gets it clean but it does it has browned over the the couple of years uh-huh um-hum you know but it really don't look that bad even though it has gotten brown you know what i should have done now that i think about it was used brown colored grout and just start out with that and uh-huh and that's right that's right you know because it does stain some i mean you could whiten it but i never have well how long did it take you to complete this um about three months probably three or four months that's not bad considering you did it yourself although i'm sure it was a real pain to have to live you know with everything yeah yeah well it was for a while the worst part about it was we had to do it when i got to the sink part over here what i did was i left this cabinet just about this one wall where the sink is to the very last um-hum and um i figured well you know i'll remodel the rest of the kitchen and then when we get to that point i'll do that last because we so we can keep the sink as long as possible um-hum and then we had we were without a sink about a week or a week and a half or so and um what we had to do was just take the dishes and uh put them in a big dish pan uh-huh and you get water from the bath tub and then rinse them in you know for with the bath water not not in the tub but you're just letting it run under there you know no i know what you mean sounds to me like the perfect excuse that your wife didn't cook for about three months real really yeah we did eat out a lot did you have any major catastrophes or anything not a thing not a thing i almost thought i had cut through a water pipe in the wall but i didn't i just nicked it a little bit it wasn't all the way through and now that was about it uh-huh well that's quite an undertaking uh you know yeah well have you have you done anything like that or or anything smaller or well nothing that big a deal my husband did um he made a cedar closet and shelving out in the garage uh for us which really was nice um um-hum i don't know how it is in Biloxi we Dallas has no basements i suspect Biloxi oh no no there's nothing like that here either yeah well we come from the Midwest where there's basements and you know so you have to make storage where you can uh-huh oh yeah and uh he bought the sheeting uh the cedar sheeting and put that in and i didn't know for certain how that would you know how that would work out if it would be tight enough to keep the bugs and all out but yeah sure it's been great we haven't had any problems with moths or anything and the extra he finished the outside painted it to match the uh garage walls which is white and it's just beautiful it really added a whole lot you know storagewise to the house right right oh sure yeah it does but uh i think the only glitches he ran into on that i put a few nails in it so i consider myself a partner in this but that's right you are and you're and you're half and half yeah right the only thing we had to do is down at the bottom of the doors he had to put in oh like some extra closure because even though he thought that the um the plywood that he got was straight yeah somehow the humidity or something warped it a little bit while he was building it and we have to have a little closing you know to hold it down at the bottom oh oh i understand yeah a little latch like yeah right um-hum but that that was about it but our house in only four years old so we haven't done you know just a whole lot to it at this point well yeah yeah everything is still so brand new yeah um-hum although we're talking about adding uh the the ceilings here are high and the pitch of the uh roofs are very high and we're talking about adding like some rooms up in the attic space um-hum oh i see uh because there is so much space up there well yeah sure but uh i don't know that that's something we will undertake ourselves part of it we'll probably do you know like hanging the no yeah now something like that i would probably have hire have to hire  the federal budget boy yes i was just writing something down that came to mind as i observed what's happened in our society um we i think have become uh dependent upon our federal government to do things for us that really only we can do for ourself i agree with that and i think more and more people are recognizing that and in addition to that uh we have elected people who really don't know how to manage the money uh they collect well what we've got um in my view is is a situation where we've got more people like you say that are customed that are accustomed to being taken care of and than we i mean i think it really affects all of us to a degree Glen i think we are i mean i i went through a P H D program that was funded by the Office of Navel Research that's now investigating Stanford and Harvard and MIT yeah i mean we're talking about things that have done some good but have institutionalized corruption yeah well i i really i think if you from a i mean uh you know i hate to admit that in a way but it's true yeah i i really do think that i think the first thing that we need to do and it it would be a hard uh a hard uh medicine uh for everybody to swallow but i think we're gonna have to eventually balance the budget or we're gonna sink we can't continue to pay the kind of interest that we're paying on the deficit right well and we need to spend the money better i mean we do not need eight hundred military bases around the world that's true there are lot of things we don't we don't need to be subsidizing tobacco farmers we don't need to be subsidizing water rights for people who are wealthy farm i mean basically you know it it is really true that this this country is suffering because um we are it's not that we don't have the resources we are just squandering them oh yeah throwing them away uh it's just like uh uh programs that are federally funded that if they if the they don't spend their allotment that's the way it was working on a defense department contract that's what happened then they're then they're subject to losing the next year's allotment right well that's the way the that's the way the thing works yeah and go into a spending frenzy at the year of the end at year end that's right i've seen that happen and it it's what's even sadder and what i think is the the tragic part of it that you see in this case of Stanford and MIT and these other universities that are now being investigated for criminal violations is that i think the attitude develops that we deserve this because we're the smart guys and without us society can't function and that that's no license to steal um-hum right that's true i mean i i honest to God believe that's what what's been going on and that was sort of seeped into the way we operated in those contexts well and and at the time i you know people i mean it was it was acceptable it's no longer acceptable well and well and so many people have have uh the feeling that well if it's if there if it's federal money then it's free money well it's not it costs everybody right and uh it you know just because you can uh get something from the feds uh that doesn't necessarily make it morally uh responsible right and it it's not up to the federal government necessarily to do a lot of things that people are now thinking it ought to do for example determine what industry should survive and what shouldn't survive and do a you know variety of other things if we put the money in the right place which is investing in people in the development of human capital in retraining programs for these poor people who really kind of went through school and got an high school education and thought they'd be able to at least function in a competitive marketplace or went through college or or went out into the marketplace and well and and and well don't even began to talk about the educational system i mean that is one example where it's being proven that throwing money does not create a good education okay right well and as the product of the academy i can tell you you know if it were that good how come they haven't been able to mass merchandise it and deliver it to everybody how come everybody is not the beneficiary of a Harvard MIT or Stanford education if it's that good and you really yeah yeah but i'm even talking i'm i'm not even i'm not even talking about higher education we're i'm talking about the the kids that we've got now they come out of high school that can't read and write and that also it just even the ones that that do read and write that really have a very poor poor grasp of of what a secondary education should have given them right but all the people who who are responsible for handling these kids were trained in universities and colleges uh true okay and my point is hey wait a minute something's wrong here these people are claiming this is the best well if it's the best then it should be translated right on down the line and the general i mean how long has Harvard been around um-hum yeah okay so ask yourself some questions why don't we have a higher quality with one of the world's great universities Harvard and Stanford both have schools of education um-hum i mean this is a focus it's not like this isn't an interest of theirs this is a specific focus two of the best funded institutions in the country right premier universities in the world hey wait a minute how come they can't produce something like MTV which kids want  well do you go camping Glen yes uh we live uh right to the base of the Wasatch Front so uh uh as our children were growing up we spent a lot of time camping up in the mountains different taking our children with us or deer hunting or whatever by camping you you mean really roughing it well well uh sometimes we did most of the time we'd we'd put up tents and we'd go up and stay for a week or uh weekend or go up into uh Yellowstone Park and and camp in the campgrounds up there oh but that was but we really had some enjoyable times as a family and uh some real good memories how about your experiences on camping uh what have you uh well i've our children were growing up also uh we had a boat and we'd go camping on the long weekends uh Memorial Day Fourth of July Labor Day uh-huh uh-huh and uh we went with some good friends and we'd get as many you know involved as we could and so our kids really grew up all through uh you might say junior high and high school camping and uh uh-huh well that sounds uh we've really had a good time doing it um we went to a lake called Lake Tawakoni uh it's just kind of east and south of here in Texas uh-huh and uh we camped outside one time we had a tornado come through our campgrounds it was kind of interesting we had snakes and armadillos and oh wow uh-huh all those fun things huh all the fun things that that make memories yes i'll say well we uh when we were up in uh by Yellowstone Park we had uh moose that went through our campground and we had a a bear once that went through uh-huh black bear and then we a bear oh oh uh we've seen a lot of rattle snakes uh in our camping trips oh and all of those creatures of the wild and like you say those really make memories of things the kids never forget but uh-huh i think the one that really excited the kids our kids were quite young and that's when this moose great big antlers come walking right through our campground we had a fire going and and uh it just kind of sauntered through and went over to a stream and was eating and didn't didn't mind you being there a bit huh no no no he we uh didn't bother it and uh everything was fine but uh it's uh camping has really uh been a a great part of our life and now we're we're older all of our kids are gone and we don't uh uh fact last year was the first year i didn't go out camping on the deer hunt now we have quite a deer hunting season here in Utah and i didn't first time in uh fifty four years that i hadn't gone out in the mountains for the deer hunting so oh first time huh well but anyway it uh maybe you'll get a chance to go again yeah when the grandkids uh get a little bit older then we'll we'll we'll do that again take them well we kind of gave up camping about three four years ago to and we built a lake house oh uh-huh and so now all our outdoor activities are centered around the lake house uh-huh well i would uh it's not like camping in a way but yet it is you're still uh on the well we're we're still outside but we we we figured we're getting a little too old to rough it as much as we used to right yes uh we got uh where we had a a camper then we got us a fifteen foot trailer house that we we took up and uh when we were going camping so we when we our kids were young we did uh pretty well rough it we were in some good snowstorms and uh speaking about tornados up in Yellowstone uh one went through there usually they don't have such things here but i didn't know they did yeah it took down pine trees quite a swath and uh we were there right after that happened but uh oh uh those tornados i guess are uh pretty scary things i guess most you know there's probably not any part of the country that doesn't experience them every once in a while um-hum that was amazing because that was like i say right up in Yellowstone and it's uh maybe once every hundred years or something we have something like that but uh and it happened and uh that was i bet Yellowstone was a neat place to camp in we we went up we pulled a trailer out there from Illinois um um-hum when uh probably about nineteen seventy four i'm trying no no no no it was before that it was must have been nineteen seventy two before we moved to Texas um-hum and uh we had like a sixteen foot trailer that uh we pulled behind the car uh-huh and all the kids and the dog and everything and actually i i think i liked the camping with the tent better than pulling the trailer um-hum but we made it out to Yellowstone and it was gorgeous never forget that oh it is it's it's beautiful we've spent a lot of time up there and that but that's a long ways to pull a trailer yeah it was and uh we needless to say we haven't we haven't done it again pulling the trailer is not the our favorite thing to do yeah no  well what kind of exercise do you do uh well on a daily basis uh at lunch time i take a brisk walk for twenty minutes along with a friend at work okay i am uh paying for a lifetime membership with President's Health Spa you're paying for it but not utilizing it too much well i don't i don't get there very often but um i figure one of these days i will um yeah i'm not i'm not currently uh enrolled in a athletic club or anything uh i try to get out and do a little bit of running during the week uh when the weather is good or it's a little tough in the winter when it gets dark so early but um uh i try to get out as much as i can um-hum um-hum well i have an exercise bike um also that's that's in my my house yeah and it just sits there sits there and collects dust huh um-hum not doing me very much good uh i i lived in Colorado quite a few years and i was more inspired to workout there just because the weather was uh clear more of the time and and i like to stay in better shape to go out and do a lot of skiing and things like that and since i moved to Dallas i guess i haven't been as inspired to get out and do as much um-hum um-hum well i i'm from New York and i'm a lot more inspired here in Dallas than i was there because there's a lot more uh open space yeah and you just you just see a lot more people doing it you know outside outside all of the time yeah i i find it kind of uh kind of a chore i guess to go uh uh on a regular and schedule to work working out inside i'd much rather be outside either bicycling or or running or doing that type of thing hm um-hum speaking of bicycling i saw a uh a video in uh Blockbusters and it was something for you to sit on your bike and look at while you're you're um you're doing your workout have you uh-huh oh is it like a scenery or something yeah it's like you're going through hills or something and it's yeah i guess you can put it in a higher gear if you wanted wanted to pretend you're going up the hill yeah have you have you watched one of those yeah no i haven't but i i have seen some things uh uh advertised in videos like that and i've heard some athletic clubs have uh have machines with a screen like that and that actually the computer uh when when it shows you're going up a hill it actually makes the bike peddle harder and things like that oh wow and so it it uh trying to be a little bit realistic i guess they have the nice scenery like you know uh biking up some mountain road or something like that yeah yeah um i keep saying i'm going to um rent one and maybe i i'll get to to get on my bike and and use it yeah we bought a uh stepper and uh in the winter time i've tired to use that uh a couple of times a week just because it's so hard to get outside and um-hum and and do much in the way of either you like say fast walking or uh running i work downtown and it not as convenient to get out at lunchtime downtown Dallas although there there is a Y very close i guess i could do that um-hum um-hum well they have those steppers in President's although i haven't i haven't used one of them but i do see people on them and they they're supposed to be really really really a great uh workout there they they do work you pretty good and um other things i've used that give you pretty good workout uh the rowing machines aren't to bad and one of the best ones although good for people who aren't used to cross country skiing those Nordic uh skiing machines give you a real good workout but if you are not used to that some people don't like it because they don't feel like they they have good um-hum um-hum balance i guess it's it it's better if you know how to cross country ski before you use those um-hum yeah i've been on the rowing machine at uh President's and uh i i like that what's the i've i've heard some other people uh not too happy with President's uh they join and then it seems like that they don't have a lot of good things to say about it well well one thing i find that you know once the first time i joined and went in there they they measured me and weighed and weighed me and all this stuff and wrote my name down on a little card and they show take you around they show you all the equipment and then you never see hear from them again you know you you're really basically on your own oh the yeah you know they tell you how many of these to do and many of those to do and then you you know they never like call you back and say well it's time for us to see how yeah  go ahead Vickie well um i had planned a very successful cousins reunion i have a lot of cousins and i did that several years ago in fact it was so well received they've been really having a pi fit for me to do it again um-hum i've never actually got to plan one but i've came to several back here in Tennessee that uh were planned long distance with people you know because my immediate family is like five states um-hum um-hum and they've all turned out pretty good and this time we're here for my mother's eighty fifth birthday good oh how neat and we had a big dinner today about thirty people and uh-huh is it going to be over a several day period or was it over several uh well the birthday was today and tomorrow one of our nephew's one of my nephew's is getting married so a lot of people came from well to Florida Virginia and Texas and Tennessee here for that for both occasions um-hum um-hum um-hum well that's kind of nice to be able to do that to for both occasions my my uh family so it's been um my father's family uh he had five or six oh i let see six brothers and sisters and uh when my grandmother died we found that we were not getting together except um just when somebody died yeah it was only funerals and so it was kind of sad so about i guess it was about two or three years ago i planed this cousins reunion and how i my my cousins even though we're all fairly close there's only two or three of them that's out of town and out of state uh i we didn't keep in close contact and there were sometimes well let's see one one family had five and one family had four children and the rest of us were you know like two and three and uh so i just sent to the oldest child in each you know uh in each family uh my oldest cousin in every family to uh to send me their brother's and sister's names and addresses and their names of their spouses and i got good pretty good response from that had to do a little phone work and then i just sent out a real neat little memo to everybody and one of the cousins helped cook the meat the meat and everybody brought a dish and uh i it just worked out really really well i i'm actually one of sixteen kids so and only nine of those kids belong to my mother oh my word um-hum and they were all here in Tennessee today the first time we have all been together for a snap shot in well forever it's been in my memory yeah well i i can imagine it's hard to get that many people together the last time we had a legitimate family reunion one of the sisters couldn't make it so um-hum everybody had pictures of everybody together but her oh shoot well how often do you all do you have try to have like reunion so today we well it's kind of like your family sometimes it's just funerals and and and special occasions but the last family reunion was in eighty five and i'd like to see another one get going um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum i was going to you know now that the subjects been brought up uh about five years ago it was actually i didn't get to attend this but i was so wanting to but several of my sisters had got together with some other people in the neighborhood we grew up in um-hum um-hum um-hum and we had a community park and of course we all rode the same buses and stuff and they had a block or like a community reunion and um-hum um-hum um-hum oh well that's that would be fun uh-huh i didn't get to attend because i was in the process of moving to Texas over that same weekend and uh but they said you know it was a blast and they sent me pictures uh-hum it was you know people we grew up with and uh people came from all over the place to get back for that one um-hum well i don't know about you but neighborhoods just aren't like that anymore and if you can you know get together with an old neighborhood like that that is really neat yeah i would love to i mean i just love to you know stories about the kids i grew up with but uh i'd like to see i'd still like to see them yeah um-hum oh sure and and to find out what happened to everybody right um-hum well at the time you know all i could do was tell them hey well Sam's moving from New Mexico to Texas and this that and so the other so um-hum well one of the fun things i did was when i sent out my invitations i mean they weren't like invitations i just did it on a on a plain sheet of typewriting paper and i took old photographs of my cousins um when they were little real little and just did kind of a collage yeah on on that you know and just just printed it on uh a real good copy machine uh you know you they weren't really good pictures but that you could tell who everybody was and it yeah um-hum and everybody got a big kick out of that because there were a lot of pictures that i had that nobody else had had hum a few years ago my wife's family and they're off in a little town in Missouri and uh um-hum they planned it for several years and actually had a book made of peoples stories and where people went and photographs that went back about two hundred years and uh and of course um-hum oh that would be fun uh was that it wasn't that wasn't a genealogy book or it was no it each each family that lived in it was it was different than that  okay Gene so it's nice to talk with you and um food is a very intriguing thing our lives are are built around foods that we like and and nutritionally good for us what kind of dining out do you like yes sir well there is two kinds one i guess i'd say is with my wife where we enjoy uh oh oh i guess we usually enjoy a good seafood restaurant uh you know something nice yeah and the other is with my whole family whom we uh go somewhere that the kids will enjoy uh recently we've been hitting Pancho's up it's a local Mexican restaurant pretty heavily because they've got a good rate on the you know good prices and everything uh-huh Pancho that's a new one um-hum yeah yeah it's it's a chain down here uh it goes up into Colorado and down here i don't know where else it is what about you we had one called Chi-Chi's in this in our area oh yeah and uh we had a restaurant called La Bamba but it's just it closed recently but Chi-Chi's is a national restaurant i think isn't it Mexican do you have it there i think think it might be i've seen i think i've seen it around yes sir yeah uh-huh well i love Mexican food myself oh do you yeah but you go ahead now oh we we do too we uh we enjoy Mexican food i'm just not impressed with the quality of it it's just primarily the price that's uh satisfying at this point but the kids seem to enjoy it is that right uh-huh and uh let's see we've uh just recently discovered a super restaurant down here but it's uh not part of a chain it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant but the first one we've been to that uh i don't think there was anything on the menu that that any of us had that was uh not just really super it's nice to find a place like that oh boy that is wonderful well i i agree with you on that and i was was really a seafood addict myself i i love crab meat in particular you know yeah um i uh i can almost live on on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if had to oh boy have you ever been to uh what is it Original Book Binders in Philadelphia i know the name but i haven't been there uh that's an old established uh restaurant i used to go there when i was in college uh-huh where did you go to college i went to the Naval Academy and we used to we used to go up there on uh for football games sometimes oh the Naval Academy uh-huh and have some liberty and yeah we'd go over there to uh pretty sure it was original Original Book Binders i think it was yes i'll be darn i haven't been back there in years well we're we're supposed to be talking about dining out but i'll just make one comment that uh i just retired from Penn State and uh all my work has been in research for the Navy okay what area underwater acoustics is that right did you have any dealings with the uh underwater sound reference laboratory in Orlando Florida i have dealt with nearly all of the all of the research laboratories that the country has yes sir my dad worked there for years and years that's where that's uh that's where i grew up was down in Orlando so um-hum oh you grew up in Orlando uh-huh that's uh that's interesting well i was in submarines uh well that's what i worked on okay yeah must have had some interesting uh assignments for you there when when did you retire uh end of last month well great i'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics i certainly have yeah so what i hate to uh i wish i could talk to you about that uh but uh i guess we should continue on uh okay right first okay how do you like Chinese food oh we we do enjoy that yes sir uh i don't know if we're particularly adventurous we find something we like uh like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good uh at a particular restaurant and then we usually stick by it but do you what about you uh-huh well i uh enjoy the Szechuan type of uh Chinese food hot um-hum yes yep um it's it's i i do a lot of Chinese cooking myself i have in the past i haven't done it recently but uh it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals um where did you learn how to do Chinese cooking um just at home um-hum i i enjoyed the food and i bought a lot of uh good cookbooks and i've been following through on that when you find the right cookbook why it works out uh-huh what's a good reference cookbook for Chinese food okay well that one's a good question here it's right under my nose if i can find it oh boy i guess one of the things we've uh started avoiding is the uh run of the mill chop suey and things like that but we enjoy trying uh different kinds of chicken or uh seafood you know even uh shrimp uh yeah right dishes that are fixed in a Chinese restaurant one of the the this book i have is called Chinese Cooking Made Easy um it's a paperback and i think it's by someone named Chang yeah Isabelle Chang okay thanks for that uh reference yeah yeah i think'll enjoy that okay good yeah well it certainly is nice talking with you Gene and uh what is your phone number at home  uh-huh okay i pushed it okay so what do you think um we can do to uh prevent air pollution well um i worry about incineration you know i worry that we're we're doing way too much of that although i'm not sure the one thing that i have trouble with is wood smoke whether how whether that's a very serious one or not um you know uh with yeah well you know what i was talking to my brother in Denver and he told me that they have restrictions on when they can burn their fireplace well that's what i've heard it kills me because i love fires and i and i really really care about pollution and i don't use anything that's got the the the stuff stuff the yeah i couldn't believe stuff in it you know the spray bottles and i uh try to do everything i can but that's the one thing that i think is um-hum very difficult is is uh wood fires because it seems to me that they were natural yeah i can't understand that's a that's a natural process and unlike unlike you know all of the rest of it but yeah i just couldn't figure out how could they could restrict uh you know like a fireplace because a lot of places that's all that all the heat they have in their home that that that's what they have yeah but um i you know i i am really concerned about it because you can you're beginning to well you're beginning to see the air you know well i know yeah isn't that terrible and and that's frightening and i know in California uh a whole lot is being done i don't know how well that's working and if all those things all those laws went through about about the for the car manufacturers and everything and has that do you know well i don't know all i know is that we have to have our car our car smogged every two years you know and um yeah uh-huh but i think what they're gonna do is try to get the try to get the car manufacturers to make cars that you know use gasoline more more uh better and and more cleanly or use cleaner fuel um-hum well you think that they would be able to do that you know i think they could too you know they just they don't wanna they wanna use uh i think they can do that i i think you know something that's gonna burn all this gas where we can buy more gas you know yes i think that's right i think that's right but it's scary what it's doing to to stone buildings um um-hum um-hum you know the the acid rain i mean destroying things trees are dying lot of forests are are dying of these uh in Canada and in in uh um-hum i don't know about i don't know about in California well i don't know about that either but uh i know i took a ride down Southern California just recently and it was just amazing to look you know like being up higher and looking down and seeing all this crud you know it oh it's terrible um-hum um-hum yeah well and and i had not experienced it as much my son went to Pomona and he went the school starts in the fall and that is the notorious smog season so when he first went out there about five you know five um-hum uh a long time ago four or five years ago but anyway he he called and just said mother now i know what they're talking about i mean this stuff you really feel you can't breathe um-hum yeah yeah it it it does it burns your eyes and everything but a lot of these trucks that's on the road now to i think they could do something to those because some of those trucks just smoke like heck you know uh-huh yeah yeah yeah but it doesn't seem like no one ever does anything about that no i know and and as far as what i you know i do things about almost everything else but as far as the air is concerned i am trying to buy a new car but there are no cars available with clean fuel um-hum so i can't do that um i just no the electric cars i think that was a good idea i would really go for that yeah yeah uh yeah i would too but that and it it's not affordable and it's not out there yeah right right and then i have stopped using anything but pump sprays so that i'm trying to get i'm trying not to use that whatever that's called chlorofluorocarbons some kind of anyway that's that's hurting the ozone uh level i'm trying not to do that i um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum the bad thing i do is wood fires yeah well uh we have a fireplace here to i don't burn it every night usually i just have mine on the weekends or when i have company that we're gonna be in the house all day oh no no no i didn't either yes you know and it's just nice to sit in the living room with a fireplace going but um other than that i don't use mine yeah yeah but no and i i'm not sure i'm not sure that this is something that air pollution is something individuals can work on as much as they can on some of the other ones uh like recycling or even water you know water use or saving water and that's what's scary to me yeah right right right yeah i know i think it's gonna have to be these large companies and uh-huh large companies that's right industry and the car manufacturers right right right right so and uh that we have less control i guess it depends on who we vote for and how we write you know write letters to them
