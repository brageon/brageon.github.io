Heuristics to ranking matrix. This was meant for cognitive therapy by emotional awareness. In its current shape it can be used for creative writing to blogs.

Misc files: helper, zeta, zipf, meshgrid, overlay, embed*. Matrix files: zscore, brute, helper, line-count, svm, kde, row-sums, means, eigen, symmetry. Data wrangling: stops, du, dell*, range. Match: pattern*, occur, find-gaps, rms-index, highscore, diffevol*, entity, harmony, optima. Rest: ranking, frequency, unit*, sentence, words, random, gaussian, combine, chunking, brute. Old: emails*, csv-list, cosine-folder. 

Strategies I have tested until glove embeddings. 1) energy_bids.csv to wordlists (dam, dan, eno) from bag-of-words. 2) matrix arithmetic to svm. 3) frequency table to represent 1/6 samples. Sentence generator with statistics instead of neural networks. 3) is shortest and most prefered. 

nu.txt is sw2001.txt, dat is oanc where english is located. Therefore do: chunking, rest, occur, highscore, pattern*, range, find-gaps, rms-index, combine, helper, frequency, random, gaussian, unit*, sentence, embed? (in progress). If you want impact from ebooks you can use: ranking, matrix, symmetry, rows-sums, eigen, mean, unit*, svm, kde, zscore, line-count, brute, diffevol, optima, helper.
